 item 1a risk factors 

the companys operations could be affected by various risks many of which are beyond its control based on current information the company believes that the following identifies the most material risk factors that could affect its operations past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 

risks relating to the inscope mm divestiture process nb transaction and the dow and corteva distributions 

the timing and outcome of the inscope mm divestiture process is subject to risk and uncertainties 

the outcome of the inscope mm divestiture process including the entry into a definitive agreement to effect a disposition of the inscope mm businesses is subject to approval of the dupont board of directors there can be no assurance that the company can satisfy any conditions to closing which would include obtaining any necessary approvals including regulatory approvals or will realize the expected benefits in connection with such a disposition if any in addition unforeseen liabilities future capital expenditures revenues expenses earnings synergies economic performance indebtedness financial condition losses future prospects business and management strategies could impact the value timing or pursuit of any disposition of the inscope mm businesses 

while dupont is engaged in certain internal reorganization activities to separate the inscope mm business into separate subsidiaries and to align such subsidiaries for possible disposition in a taxefficient manner it is expected that such a disposition would result in a taxable transaction for the company 

the separation and combination of dupont’s nutrition  biosciences business with iff could result in a significant tax liability to dupont 

the distribution by dupont to its stockholders of all the issued and outstanding shares of nb through the exchange offer nb distribution and mergers are expected to be taxfree to dupont stockholders for us federal income tax purposes except to the extent that cash was paid to dupont stockholders in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to the nb merger agreement and the nb contribution nb distribution and special cash payment are expected to result in no recognition of gain or loss by dupont for us federal income tax purposes 

dupont received an opinion of counsel and also obtained a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service the irs regarding certain matters impacting the us federal income tax treatment of the separation and transfer by dupont of its nb business the “nb contribution” nb distribution special cash payment and certain related transactions the conclusions of the irs private letter ruling were based among other things on various factual assumptions dupont authorized and representations dupont made to the irs if any of assumptions or representations are or become inaccurate or incomplete reliance on the irs private letter ruling may be affected 

if the nb contribution and nb distribution failed to qualify for the treatment described above dupont would be required to generally recognize a taxable gain on the transactions and stockholders of dupont who receive nb common stock and subsequently iff common stock would be subject to tax on their receipt of the nb common stock additionally if the special cash payment or certain internal transactions related to the separation of the nutrition  biosciences business fail to qualify for their intended taxfree treatment under us federal state local tax andor foreign tax law dupont could incur additional tax liabilities 

under the tax matters agreement by and between dupont with nb and iff nb or iff is generally required to indemnify dupont for any taxes resulting from the separation of the nutrition  biosciences business and any related costs and other damages to the extent such amounts resulted from i certain actions taken by nb or iff involving the capital stock of nb or iff or any assets of the nb group excluding actions required by the documents governing the proposed transactions or ii any breach of certain representations and covenants made by nb or iff 

dupont is subject to continuing contingent taxrelated liabilities of dow and corteva following the separations and dwdp distributions 

after the separations and dwdp distributions there are several significant areas where the liabilities of dow and corteva may become the company’s obligations either in whole or in part for example to the extent that any subsidiary of the company was included in the consolidated tax reporting group of either tdcc or eid for any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the effective date of the dwdp merger such subsidiary is jointly and severally liable for the us federal income tax liability of the entire consolidated tax reporting group of tdcc or eid as applicable for such taxable period in connection with the separations and dwdp distributions dupont dow and corteva have entered into a tax matters agreement as amended that allocates the responsibility for prior period consolidated taxes among dow corteva and dupont if dow or corteva are unable to pay any prior period taxes for which it is responsible however dupont could be required to 

pay the entire amount of such taxes and such amounts could be significant other provisions of federal state local or foreign law may establish similar liability for other matters including laws governing taxqualified pension plans as well as other contingent liabilities 

in connection with the separations and dwdp distributions certain liabilities are allocated to or retained by dupont through assumption or indemnification of dow andor corteva as applicable if dupont is required to make payments pursuant to these indemnities to dow andor corteva dupont may need to divert cash to meet those obligations and the company’s financial results could be negatively impacted in addition certain liabilities are allocated to or retained by dow andor corteva through assumption or indemnification or subject to indemnification by other third parties these indemnities may not be sufficient to insure the company against the full amount of liabilities including pfas stray liabilities allocated to or retained by it and dow corteva andor third parties may not be able to satisfy their respective indemnification obligations in the future 

pursuant to the dwdp separation and distribution agreement the dwdp employee matters agreement and the dwdp tax matters agreement as amended collectively the “core agreements” with dow and corteva as well as the letter agreement between dupont and corteva dupont has agreed to assume and indemnify dow and corteva for certain liabilities payments pursuant to these indemnities may be significant and could negatively impact the company’s business 

third parties could also seek to hold dupont responsible for any of the liabilities allocated to dow and corteva including those related to eid’s materials science andor agriculture businesses or for the conduct of such businesses prior to the distributions and such third parties could seek damages other monetary penalties whether civil or criminal andor other remedies additionally dupont generally assumes and is responsible for the payment of the company’s share of i certain liabilities of dowdupont relating to arising out of or resulting from certain general corporate matters of dupont and ii certain separation expenses not otherwise allocated to corteva or dow or allocated specifically to it pursuant to the core agreements and third parties could seek to hold it responsible for dow’s or corteva’s share of any such liabilities dow andor corteva as applicable have agreed to indemnify it for such liabilities however such indemnities may not be sufficient to protect it against the full amount of such liabilities or from other remedies and dow andor corteva as applicable may not be able to fully satisfy their indemnification obligations even if dupont ultimately succeeds in recovering from dow andor corteva as applicable any amounts for which dupont is held liable dupont may be temporarily required to bear these losses each of these risks could negatively affect the company’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

generally as described in litigation environmental matters and indemnifications losses from liabilities related to discontinued andor divested operations and businesses of eid that are not primarily related to its agriculture business or specialty products business “stray liabilities” are allocated to or shared by each of corteva and dupont stray liabilities include liabilities arising out of actions to the extent related to or resulting from eid’s development testing manufacture or sale of per or polyfluoroalkyl substances “pfas stray liabilities” 

at december 31 2021 the company has recorded an indemnification liability related to stray liabilities the company recognizes an indemnification liability when a loss is reasonably probable and can be reasonably estimated while the company has established processes and controls over the information to support its accounting for indemnification liabilities with each of corteva and dow the company is reliant on the accuracy transparency completeness and timeliness of information from the applicable party either corteva or dow that retains direct liability for the underlying matter estimating indemnified costs of environmental remediation and compliance activities is particularly difficult since such activities are dependent on the nature of and activity at specific sites new and evolving analytical operating and remediation technologies and techniques agreed action plans changes in environmental regulations permissible levels of specific compounds in water air or soil enforcement theories and policies including efforts to recover natural resource damages and the presence and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties 

at december 31 2021 the company had recorded indemnification assets related to various stray liabilities and other matters although the company believes it is remote there can be no assurance that any such third party would have adequate resources to satisfy its indemnification obligation when due or would not ultimately be successful in claiming defenses against payment even if recovery from the third party is ultimately successful dupont may be temporarily required to bear these losses each of these risks could negatively affect the company’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows see discussion of the core agreements in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements and litigation environmental matters and indemnifications in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

on january 22 2021 dupont corteva and chemours entered into a cost sharing arrangement related to future eligible pfas costs the company’s results of operations could be adversely affected by litigation and other commitments and contingencies including expected performance under and impact of the cost sharing arrangement 

although by reducing uncertainty the company expects to benefit from the cost sharing arrangement related to future pfas eligible costs achievement of any such benefits may not be realized and depend on a number of factors and uncertainties that include but are not limited to the achievement terms and conditions of final agreements related to the cost sharing arrangement the outcome of any pending or future litigation related to pfas or pfoa including personal injury claims and natural resource damages claims the extent and cost of ongoing remediation obligations and potential future remediation obligations changes in laws and regulations applicable to pfas chemicals changes in applicable health advisory levels and in chronic reference doses for pfas in drinking water the performance by each of the parties of their respective obligations under the cost sharing arrangement 

dupont faces risks arising from various unasserted and asserted litigation matters including product liability patent infringement and other intellectual property disputes contract and commercial litigation claims for damage or personal injury antitrust claims governmental regulations and other actions an adverse outcome in any one or more of these matters could be material to the company’s business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in the ordinary course of business dupont may make certain commitments including representations warranties and indemnities relating to current and past operations including those related to divested businesses and dupont may issue guarantees of thirdparty obligations if dupont is required to make payments as a result they could exceed the amounts accrued therefor thereby adversely affecting the company’s results of operations 

if the completed distribution of corteva or dow in each case together with certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for nonrecognition treatment for us federal income tax purposes then the company could be subject to significant tax and indemnification liability 

the completed distributions of corteva and dow were each conditioned upon the receipt of an opinion from skadden arps slate meagher  flom llp the company’s tax counsel regarding the qualification of the applicable distribution along with certain related transactions as a taxfree transaction under section 355 and section 368a1d of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” and such opinions collectively the “tax opinions” the tax opinions relied on certain facts assumptions and undertakings and certain representations from the company dow and corteva as applicable as well as the irs ruling as defined below notwithstanding the tax opinions and the irs ruling the internal revenue service the “irs” could determine on audit that either or both of the distributions and certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or that the distributions should be taxable for other reasons including if the irs were to disagree with the conclusions of the tax opinions 

even if a distribution otherwise constituted a taxfree transaction to stockholders under section 355 of the code the company could be required to recognize corporate level tax on such distribution and certain related transactions under section 355e of the code if the irs determines that as a result of the dwdp merger or other transactions considered part of a plan with such distribution there was a 50 percent or greater change in ownership in the company dow or corteva as relevant in connection with the dwdp merger the company sought and received a private letter ruling from the irs regarding the proper time manner and methodology for measuring common ownership in the stock of the company eid and tdcc for purposes of determining whether there was a 50 percent or greater change of ownership under section 355e of the code as a result of the dwdp merger the “irs ruling” the tax opinions relied on the continued validity of the irs ruling and representations made by the company as to the common ownership of the stock of tdcc and eid immediately prior to the dwdp merger and concluded that there was not a 50 percent or greater change of ownership for purposes of section 355e as a result of the dwdp merger notwithstanding the tax opinions and the irs ruling the irs could determine that a distribution or a related transaction should nevertheless be treated as a taxable transaction to the company if it determines that any of the company’s facts assumptions representations or undertakings was not correct or that a distribution should be taxable for other reasons including if the irs were to disagree with the conclusions in the tax opinions that are not covered by the irs ruling 

generally corporate taxes resulting from the failure of a distribution to qualify for nonrecognition treatment for us federal income tax purposes would be imposed on the company under the dwdp tax matters agreement as amended that the company entered into with dow and corteva dow and corteva are generally obligated to indemnify the company against any such taxes imposed on it however if a distribution fails to qualify for nonrecognition treatment for us federal income tax purposes for certain reasons relating to the overall structure of the dwdp merger and the distributions then under the dwdp tax matters agreement as amended the company and corteva on the one hand and dow on the other hand would share the tax liability resulting from such failure in accordance with the relative equity values of the company and dow on the first full trading day following the distribution of dow and the company and corteva would in turn share any such resulting tax liability 

in accordance with the relative equity values of the company and corteva on the first full trading day following the distribution of corteva furthermore under the terms of the dwdp tax matters agreement as amended a party also generally will be responsible for any taxes imposed on the other parties that arise from the failure of either distribution to qualify as taxfree for us federal income tax purposes within the meaning of section 355 of the code or the failure of certain related transactions to qualify for taxfree treatment to the extent such failure to qualify is attributable to actions events or transactions relating to such party or such partys affiliates’ stock assets or business or any breach of such partys representations made in connection with the irs ruling or in any representation letter provided to a tax advisor in connection with certain tax opinions including the tax opinions regarding the taxfree status of the distributions and certain related transactions to the extent that the company is responsible for any liability under the dwdp tax matters agreement as amended there could be a material adverse impact on the companys business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in future reporting periods 

the dwdp separations and dwdp distributions and the nb transaction may expose the company to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal distribution requirements 

although in connection with the dwdp distributions and in connection with the nb transaction dupont received separate solvency opinions from investment banks confirming that dupont dow corteva and nb would each be adequately capitalized following the separations and dwdp distributions and the nb transactions as relevant the “transactions” the transactions could be challenged under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws fraudulent conveyances or transfers are generally defined to include transfers made or obligations incurred with the actual intent to hinder delay or defraud current or future creditors or transfers made or obligations incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value when the debtor was insolvent or that rendered the debtor insolvent inadequately capitalized or unable to pay its debts as they become due any unpaid creditor could claim that dupont did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value in any of the transactions and that any one or the aggregate of the transactions left dupont insolvent or with unreasonably small capital or that dupont intended or believed dupont would incur debts beyond the company’s ability to pay such debts as they mature if a court were to agree with such a plaintiff then such court could void the separations and distributions as a fraudulent transfer or impose substantial liabilities on it which could adversely affect the company’s financial condition and the company’s results of operations 

the transactions are also subject to review under state corporate distribution statutes under the delaware general corporation law a corporation may only pay dividends to its stockholders either i out of its surplus net assets minus capital or ii if there is no such surplus out of its net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared andor the preceding fiscal year although dupont’s board of directors made the distributions out of dupont’s surplus and received an opinion that dupont had adequate surplus under delaware law to declare the dividends of corteva and dow common stock in connection with the dwdp distributions there can be no assurance that a court will not later determine that some or all of the distributions were unlawful 

risks relating to dupont’s business and results of operations 

the extent to which the novel coronavirus and variants covid19 and measures taken in response to it impact dupont’s business results of operations access to sources of liquidity and financial condition depends on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted 

dupont is actively monitoring the global impacts of the covid19 pandemic including the impacts from responsive measures and remains focused on its top priorities  the safety and health of its employees and the needs of its customers the company’s business and financial condition and the business and financial condition of the company’s customers and suppliers have been and continue to be impacted by the significantly increased economic supply and demand uncertainties created by the covid19 outbreak in addition public and private sector responsive measures such as the imposition of travel restrictions quarantines adoption of remote working and suspension of nonessential business and government services have impacted the company’s business and financial condition many of dupont’s facilities and employees are based in areas impacted by the virus while most dupont manufacturing sites remain in operation dupont has reduced or furloughed when necessary certain operations in response to government measures employee welfare concerns and the impact of covid19 on the global demand and supply chain dupont’s manufacturing operations may be further adversely affected by impacts from covid19 including among other things additional government actions and other responsive measures more and or deeper supply chain disruptions quarantines and health and availability of essential onsite personnel in response the company developed sitebysite protocols in 2020 under which the company continues to operate these protocols include preentrance screening restricting visitor access social distancing and masking requirements additional sanitization and disinfecting requirements restrictions on all nonessential travel and implementation of workfromhome protocols limitations on travel and doing business inperson has increased the company’s exposure to cybersecurity risks and could negatively impact the companys innovation and marketing efforts challenge the ability to deliver against the company’s strategic priorities and to otherwise transact business in a timely manner or create operational or other challenges any of which could harm dupont’s business furthermore covid19 continues to adversely impact the broader global economy including negatively impacting economic 

growth and creating disruption and volatility in the global financial and capital markets which could result in increases in the cost of capital andor adversely impact the availability of and access to capital which could negatively affect dupont’s liquidity dupont is unable to predict the extent of covid19 related impacts on its business results of operations access to sources of liquidity and financial condition which depends on highly uncertain and unpredictable future developments including but not limited to the duration and spread of the covid19 outbreak its severity the emergence of new variants actions taken in response the efficacy and availability of vaccines and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions resume dupont’s financial results may be materially and adversely impacted by a variety of factors that have not yet been determined including potential impairments of goodwill and other assets dupont when necessary is taking actions including reducing costs restructuring actions and delaying certain capital expenditures and nonessential spend in addition the company may consider further reductions in or furloughing additional operations in response to further andor deeper declines in demand andor or supply chain disruptions there can be no guaranty that such actions will significantly mitigate the impact of covid19 on the company’s business results of operations access to sources of liquidity or financial condition and the company may continue to experience materially adverse impacts to its business results of operations and financial condition as a result of related global economic impacts including inflationary pressures that have occurred and may continue to occur in the future 

supply chain and operational disruptions and volatility in energy and raw material costs could significantly increase costs and expenses and adversely impact the company’s sales and earnings 

the company’s manufacturing processes and operations depend on the continued availability of energy and raw materials the costs of which are subject to worldwide supply and demand as well as other factors beyond the company’s control including potential legislation to address climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions creating a carbon tax or implementing a cap and trade program which could create increases in costs and price volatility operational changes and transition to renewable energy sources to meet country ngo and corporatelevel netzero ghg emissions pledges and related decarbonization technology investments may require the company to make significant capital investments requalify its products with certain suppliers as well as meet additional regulatory and compliance requirements and could result in higher cost and expenses 

supply chain disruptions plant andor power outages labor shortages andor strikes geopolitical activity weather events and natural disasters including hurricanes or flooding that impact coastal regions and global health risks or pandemics could seriously harm the company’s operations as well as the operations of the company’s customers and suppliers climate change increases the frequency and severity of potential supply chain and operational disruptions from weather events and natural disasters the chronic physical impacts associated with climate change for example increased temperatures changes in weather patterns and rising sea levels could significantly increase costs and expenses and create additional supply chain and operational disruption risks 

in addition the company’ suppliers may experience capacity limitations in their own operations or may elect to reduce or eliminate certain product lines to address this risk generally the company seeks to have many sources of supply for key raw materials in order to avoid significant dependence on any one or a few suppliers in addition and where the supply market for key raw materials is concentrated dupont takes additional steps to manage its exposure to supply chain risk and price fluctuations through among other things negotiated longterm contracts some which include minimum purchase obligations however there can be no assurance that such mitigation efforts will prevent future difficulty in obtaining sufficient and timely delivery of certain raw materials 

dupont also takes actions to offset the effects of higher energy and raw material costs through selling price increases productivity improvements and cost reduction programs success in offsetting higher raw material costs with price increases is largely influenced by competitive and economic conditions and could vary significantly depending on the market served as a result volatility in these costs may negatively impact the company’s business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the company’s business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected by interruption of the company’s information technology or network systems and other business disruptions 

dupont relies on centralized and local information technology networks and systems some of which are managed or accessible by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to otherwise manage or support its business additionally the company collects and stores certain data including proprietary business information and has access to confidential or personal information that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations and customerimposed controls the processing and storage of personal information is increasingly subject to privacy and data security regulations and many such regulations are countryspecific the interpretation and application of data protection laws in the us europe including the eu general data protection regulation asia pacific latin america and elsewhere are uncertain evolving and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions violations of these laws could result in criminal or civil sanctions and even the mere 

allegation of such violations could harm the company’s ability to do business its results of operations financial position and reputation 

information technology system andor network disruptions whether caused by acts of sabotage employee error malfeasance or other actions could have an adverse impact on the company’s operations as well as the operations of the company’s customers and suppliers some of the company’s systems use open source software which can create additional risks including potential security vulnerabilities other business disruptions may also be caused by security breaches which could include for example attacks on information technology and infrastructure by hackers viruses breaches due to employee error malfeasance or other actions or other disruptions dupont andor the company’s suppliers may fail to effectively prevent detect and recover from these or other security breaches and therefore such breaches could result in misuse of the company’s assets loss of property including trade secrets and confidential or personal information some of which is subject to privacy and security laws and other business disruptions as a result dupont may be subject to legal claims or proceedings reporting errors processing inefficiencies negative media attention loss of sales interference with regulatory compliance which could result in sanctions or penalties liability or penalties under privacy laws disruption in the company’s operations and damage to the company’s reputation which could adversely affect the company’s business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

like most major corporations dupont is the target of industrial espionage including cyberattacks from time to time dupont continues to experience an increase in attempts to breach its information technology systems including in conjunction with implementation of workfromhome protocols adopted in response to covid19 these cybersecurity threats include phishing spam emails hacking social engineering and malicious software dupont has determined that these attacks have resulted and could result in the future in unauthorized parties gaining access to certain confidential business information although management does not believe that dupont has experienced any material losses to date related to these security breaches including cybersecurity incidents there can be no assurance that dupont will not suffer such losses in the future 

dupont has engaged and expects to continue to engage in merger  acquisition activity as part of preparatory and postclosing integration activities the company i conducts a cybersecurity risk threat assessment and when evidence of a breach is uncovered conducts additional due diligence ii based on the assessment the company develops and implements risk mitigation plans if needed and brings the acquisition under the company’s cyberattackbreach detection and response programs and iii conducts an internal controls risk and compliance assessment and creates responsive action plans as needed to mitigate and remediate identified weaknesses in the control environment 

dupont seeks to actively manage the risks within the company’s control that could lead to business disruptions and security breaches as these threats continue to evolve particularly around cybersecurity dupont may be required to expend significant resources to enhance the company’s control environment processes practices and other protective measures despite these efforts such events could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

enforcing the company’s intellectual property rights or defending against intellectual property claims asserted by others could adversely affect the company’s business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

intellectual property rights including patents trade secrets knowhow and confidential information trademarks tradenames and trade dress are important to the company’s business dupont endeavors to protect the company’s business products and processes by obtaining and enforcing intellectual property rights under the intellectual property laws of certain jurisdictions around the world however dupont may be unable to obtain or enforce its intellectual property rights in key jurisdictions for various reasons including government policies and regulations and changes in such policies and regulations including changes made in reaction to pressure from nongovernmental organizations or the public generally which could impact the extent of intellectual property protection afforded by such jurisdictions 

dupont has designed and implemented internal controls intended to restrict access to and unauthorized use of the company’s confidential information and trade secrets despite these precautions the company’s confidential information and trade secrets are vulnerable to unauthorized access and use through employee error or actions theft by employees or third parties cybersecurity incidents and other security breaches when unauthorized access and use is discovered dupont considers the matter for report to governmental authorities for investigation as appropriate and takes measures intended to mitigate any potential impact and to stop unauthorized access 

third parties may also claim the company’s products violate their intellectual property rights defending such claims even those without merit is timeconsuming and expensive in addition as a result of such claims dupont has and could be required in the future to enter into license agreements develop noninfringing products or engage in litigation that could be costly if challenges are resolved adversely it could negatively impact the company’s ability to obtain licenses on competitive terms commercialize new products and generate sales from existing products 

any one or more of the above factors could significantly affect the company’s business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets could negatively impact the company’s financial results 

in connection with completed acquisitions dupont has recorded goodwill and other intangible assets on our balance sheet as a result of the dwdp merger and related acquisition method of accounting eid’s assets and liabilities were remeasured and dowdupont recognized them at fair value since certain of the companys assets especially those related to the materials  mobility and water  protection segments and those carried at corporate at december 31 2021 are heritage eid declines if any in projected cash flows could have a material negative impact on the fair value of the company’s reporting units and assets 

in accordance with us gaap at least annually dupont must assess both goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment intangible assets with finite lives are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable if testing indicates that goodwill or intangible assets are impaired their carrying values will be written down based on fair values with a charge against earnings where dupont utilizes discounted cash flow methodologies in determining fair values significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses unexpected significant change or planned changes in use of our assets changes in the structure of our business divestitures market capitalization declines or increases in associated discount rates may impair our goodwill and other intangible assets accordingly any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of goodwill or intangible assets could negatively impact the company’s results of operations 

failure to effectively manage acquisitions divestitures alliances and other portfolio actions could adversely impact the company’s business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

dupont continuously evaluates acquisition candidates including significant transactions that may strategically fit the company’s business andor growth objectives if dupont is unable to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses dupont could fail to achieve anticipated synergies and cost savings including any expected increases in revenues and operating results which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results dupont expects to continually review the company’s portfolio of assets for contributions to the company’s objectives and alignment with the company’s growth strategy the letter agreement between the company and corteva limits dupont’s ability to separate certain businesses and assets to third parties without assigning certain of its indemnification obligations under the dwdp separation and distribution agreement to the transferee of such businesses and assets or meeting certain other alternative conditions dupont may be unable to meet the conditions under the letter agreement if applicable even if the conditions under the letter agreement are met or are not applicable dupont may not be successful in separating underperforming or nonstrategic assets and gains or losses on the divestiture of or lost operating income from such assets may affect the company’s earnings moreover dupont might incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures that reduce the company’s earnings in addition if the execution or implementation of acquisitions divestitures alliances joint ventures and other portfolio actions is not successful andor the company fails to effectively manage its cost as its portfolio evolves it could adversely impact the company’s business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

failure to maintain a streamlined operating model and sustain operational improvements may reduce the company’s profitability or adversely impact the company’s business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the company’s profitability and margin growth will depend in part on the company’s ability to maintain a streamlined operating model and drive sustainable improvements through actions and projects such as consolidation of manufacturing facilities transitions to costcompetitive regions and product line rationalizations a variety of factors may adversely affect the company’s ability to realize the targeted cost synergies including failure to successfully optimize the company’s facilities footprint the failure to take advantage of the company’s global supply chain the failure to identify and eliminate duplicative programs there can be no assurance that dupont is be able to achieve or sustain any or all of the cost savings generated from restructuring actions 

the company’s results will be affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences 

demand for the company’s products which impacts revenue and profit margins will be affected by i the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products ii the company’s response to downward pricing trends to stay competitive iii changes in customer preferences order patterns such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes iv availability and cost of raw materials and energy as well as the company’s ability and success in passing through increases in such costs v levels of economic growth in the geographic and end use markets served by the company and vi the megatrends in digital transformation connectivity automation and ethics environmental impact and sustainability driven purchasing decisions 

demand for product offerings that are less carbonintensive and help customers reduce ghg emissions is expected to continue to increase driven by enduser and customer demand investor preference and government legislative and market and productspecific actions in response to risks created by climate change failure to timely react to these trends and manage the company’s product portfolio and innovation activities responsively could decrease the competitiveness of the company’s products and result in the deselection of the company as a partner of choice in addition the failure to set and make progress commensurate with relevant market competitors toward the company’s esg goals could harm the company’s reputation and its ability to compete and to attract top talent and could result in increased investor activism 

additionally success in achieving the company’s growth objectives is significantly dependent on the timing and market acceptance of the company’s new product offerings including the company’s ability to renew the company’s pipeline of new product offerings and to bring those offerings to market this ability may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development such as the inability to identify viable new products obtain adequate intellectual property protection or gain market acceptance of new products 

there are no guarantees that new product offerings will prove to be commercially successful additionally the company’s expansion into new markets may result in greaterthanexpected risks liabilities and expenses 

failure to attract and retain talented people with the necessary knowledge and experience could adversely affect company’s ability to compete and achieve its strategic goals 

attracting developing and retaining talented employees is essential to the company’s successful delivery of products and services ability to innovate including developing new products and technologies and ability to identify trends and develop new markets 

competition for employees can be intense if the company is unable to successfully integrate motivate and reward its employees it may not be able to retain them or attract new employee in the future which could adversely impact the company’s ability to effectively compete the company may be required to increase salary andor benefits to attract top performers which could significantly increase the company costs and results of operations 

risks relating to capital resources and liquidity 

changes in the company’s credit ratings could increase the company’s cost of borrowing or restrict the company’s ability to access debt capital markets the company’s credit ratings are important to the company’s cost of capital 

dupont relies on access to the debt capital markets and other shortterm borrowings to finance the company’s longterm and daytoday operations a decrease in the ratings assigned to it by the ratings agencies may negatively impact the company’s access to the debt capital markets and increase the company’s cost of borrowing the major rating agencies will routinely evaluate the company’s credit profile and assign debt ratings to it this evaluation is based on a number of factors which include weighing the company’s financial strength versus business industry and financial risk the addition of further leverage to the company’s capital structure could impact the company’s credit ratings failure to maintain an investment grade rating at the company’s current level would adversely affect the company’s cost of funding and the company’s results of operations and could adversely affect the company’s liquidity and access to the capital markets any limitation on the company’s ability to continue to raise money in the debt capital markets could have a substantial negative effect on the company’s liquidity if dupont is unable to generate sufficient cash flow or maintain access to adequate external financing including from significant disruptions in the global credit markets it could restrict the company’s current operations activities under its current and future stock buyback programs and the company’s growth opportunities which could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

a significant percentage of the company’s net sales are generated from the company’s international operations and are subject to economic geopolitical foreign exchange and other risks 

dupont does business globally in about 60 countries the percentage of net sales generated by the international operations of dupont including us exports was approximately 74 percent of net sales on a continuing operations basis for the year ended december 31 2021 with asia pacific as the company’s largest region by revenue and china as the largest country within the asia pacific region and second largest globally by revenue dupont expects the percentage of the company’s net sales derived from international operations to continue to be significant risks related to international operations include 

• exchange control regulations 

• fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 

• foreign investment laws 

the company’s international operations expose it to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar which could adversely affect the company’s results of operations for its continuing operations as of the year ended december 31 2021 the company’s largest currency exposures are the european euro chinese renminbi and japanese yen us dollar fluctuations against foreign currency have an impact to commercial prices and raw material costs in some cases and could result in local price increases if the price or raw material costs is denominated in us dollar 

sales and expenses of the company’s nonus businesses are also translated into us dollars for reporting purposes and fluctuations of foreign currency against the us dollar could impact us dollardenominated earnings in addition the company’s assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies can also be impacted by foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar which could result in exchange gain or loss from revaluation 

dupont also faces exchange rate risk from the company’s investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries 

dupont has a balance sheet hedging program and actively looks for opportunities in managing currency exposures related to earnings however foreign exchange hedging activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to it or be successful in completely mitigating such exposures 

dupont generates significant amounts of cash outside of the united states that is invested with financial and nonfinancial counterparties while dupont employs comprehensive controls regarding global cash management to guard against cash or investment loss and to ensure the company’s ability to fund the company’s operations and commitments a material disruption to the counterparties with whom dupont transacts business could expose it to financial loss 

any one or more of the above factors could adversely affect the company’s international operations and could significantly affect the company’s business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

risks related to regulatory changes and compliance 

the costs of complying with evolving regulatory requirements could negatively impact the company’s business results of operations financial condition and cash flows actual or alleged violations of environmental laws or permit requirements could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations and substantial civil or criminal sanctions as well as the assessment of strict liability andor joint and several liability 

dupont continues to be subject to extensive federal state local and foreign laws regulations rules and ordinances relating to pollution protection of the environment greenhouse gas emissions and the generation storage handling transportation treatment disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials costs and capital expenditures relating to environmental health or safety matters are subject to evolving regulatory requirements and depend on the timing of the promulgation and enforcement of specific standards which impose the requirements moreover changes in environmental regulations could inhibit or interrupt the company’s operations or require modifications to the company’s facilities changes to regulations or the implementation of additional regulations may result in significant costs or capital expenditures or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced margins or profitability 

accordingly environmental health or safety regulatory matters could result in significant unanticipated costs or liabilities causing a negative impact on the company’s business cash flows and results of operations 

the company’s business results of operations and reputation could be adversely affected by industryspecific risks including process safety and product stewardshipregulatory compliance issues 

dupont is subject to risks which include but are not limited to product safety or quality shifting consumer preferences and public perception federal state and local regulations on manufacturing or labeling environmental health and safety regulations and customer product liability claims 

in most jurisdictions dupont must test the safety efficacy and environmental impact of the company’s products to satisfy regulatory requirements and obtain the needed approvals in certain jurisdictions dupont must periodically renew the company’s approvals which may require it to demonstrate compliance with thencurrent standards the regulatory approvals process is lengthy complex and in some markets unpredictable with requirements that can vary by product technology industry and country regulatory standards and trial procedures are continuously changing in response to technological developments changes in legislation and governmental ngo and societal demands for increasing levels of product safety and environmental protection the pace of change together with the lack of regulatory harmony could result in unintended noncompliance to maintain the company’s right to produce or sell existing products or to commercialize new products dupont must be able to demonstrate the company’s ability to satisfy the requirements of regulatory agencies industries and customers 

the failure to meet existing and new requirements or receive necessary permits or approvals could have near and longterm effects on the company’s ability to produce and sell certain current and future products which could significantly increase operating costs and adversely affect the company’s business results of operations financial condition and cash flows in addition negative publicity related to product liability safety health and environmental matters may damage the company’s reputation 

changes in tax rates adoption of new tax legislation and the distribution of income among the various jurisdictions in which the company operates could adversely impact dupont’s results of operations 

duponts future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in tax laws regulations and judicial rulings or changes in the interpretation thereof changes in generally accepted accounting principles changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of the company’s tax exposures and various other governmental enforcement initiatives the company’s tax expense includes estimates of tax reserves and reflects other estimates and assumptions including assessments of future earnings of the company which could impact the valuation of the company’s deferred tax assets 

changes in tax laws or regulations including further regulatory developments arising from proposed us tax legislation the final form of which is uncertain multijurisdictional changes enacted in response to the action items provided by the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd and the oced’s european commission’s and other major jurisdiction’s heightened interest in and taxation of large multinational companies increase tax uncertainty and impact the company’s effective tax rate and provision for income taxes given the unpredictability of possible further changes to and the potential interdependency of the united states or foreign tax laws and regulations it is difficult to predict the cumulative effect of such tax laws and regulations on dupont’s results of operations 

the company’s business results of operations and reputation could be harmed by improper conduct by its employees agents or business partners 

dupont is required to comply with numerous us and nonus laws and regulations including those related to anticorruption antibribery global trade trade sanctions antitrust antimoney laundering laws antislavery and human rights the company’s policies mandate compliance with these laws and regulations the company operates globally including in parts of the world that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption and where local customs and practices can be inconsistent with anticorruption andor antibribery laws despite the company’s training and compliance program dupont cannot ensure that its internal control processes will prevent improper action by employees agents distributors suppliers or business partners violations of these laws could result in criminal or civil sanctions and even the mere allegation of such violations could harm the company’s ability to do business its results of operations financial position and reputation

accounting for employee benefit plans involves numerous assumptions and estimates discount rate and expected return on plan assets are two critical assumptions in measuring the cost and benefit obligation of the companys pension plans management reviews these two key assumptions when plans are remeasured these and other assumptions are updated periodically to reflect the actual experience and expectations on a plan specific basis as appropriate as permitted by gaap actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated on a plan by plan basis and to the extent that such differences exceed 10 percent of the greater of the plans benefit obligation or the applicable plan assets the excess is amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees or the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants if all or almost all of a plan’s participants are inactive 

for the majority of the benefit plans the company utilizes the aon aa corporate bond yield curves to determine the discount rate applicable to each country at the measurement date 

the company establishes strategic asset allocation percentage targets and appropriate benchmarks for significant asset classes in accordance with the laws and practices of those countries where appropriate assetliability studies are also taken into consideration for plans the longterm expected return on plan assets pension expense is determined using the fair value of assets 

the following table highlights the potential impact on the companys pretax earnings due to changes in certain key assumptions with respect to the companys pension plans based on assets and liabilities at december 31 2021 



additional information with respect to pension plans liabilities and assumptions is discussed under longterm employee benefits and in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements 

legal contingencies 

the companys results of operations could be affected by significant litigation adverse to the company including product liability claims patent infringement and antitrust claims and claims for third party property damage or personal injury stemming from alleged environmental torts the company records accruals for legal matters when the information available indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated management makes adjustments to these accruals to reflect the impact and status of negotiations settlements rulings advice of counsel and other information and events that may pertain to a particular matter predicting the outcome of claims and lawsuits and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates in making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters management considers many factors these factors include but are not limited to the nature of specific claims including unasserted claims the companys experience with similar types of claims the jurisdiction in which the matter is filed input from outside legal counsel the likelihood of resolving the 

matter through alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and the matters current status considerable judgment is required in determining whether to establish a litigation accrual when an adverse judgment is rendered against the company in a court proceeding in such situations the company will not recognize a loss if based upon a thorough review of all relevant facts and information management believes that it is probable that the pending judgment will be successfully overturned on appeal a detailed discussion of significant litigation matters is contained in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

the breadth of the companys operations and the global complexity of tax regulations require assessments of uncertainties and judgments in estimating taxes the company will ultimately pay the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions outcomes of tax litigation and resolution of disputes arising from federal state and international tax audits in the normal course of business the resolution of these uncertainties may result in adjustments to the companys tax assets and tax liabilities it is reasonably possible that changes to the company’s global unrecognized tax benefits could be significant however due to the uncertainty regarding the timing of completion of audits and the possible outcomes a current estimate of the range of increases or decreases that may occur within the next twelve months cannot be made 

deferred income taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of the companys assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets the realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies for example changes in facts and circumstances that alter the probability that the company will realize deferred tax assets could result in recording a valuation allowance thereby reducing the deferred tax asset and generating a deferred tax expense in the relevant period in some situations these changes could be material 

at december 31 2021 the company had a net deferred tax liability balance of 18 billion net of a valuation allowance of 08 billion realization of deferred tax assets is expected to occur over an extended period of time as a result changes in tax laws assumptions with respect to future taxable income and tax planning strategies could result in adjustments to deferred tax assets see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details related to the deferred tax liability balance 

assessments of longlived assets and goodwill 

the assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are measured at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired including identified intangibles is recorded as goodwill the determination and allocation of fair value to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on various assumptions and valuation methodologies requiring considerable management judgment including estimates based on historical information current market data and future expectations the principal assumptions in these analyses include future cash flow projections the weighted average cost of capital the terminal growth rate and the tax rate for the income approach for the market approach the company uses metrics of publicly traded companies or historically completed transactions of comparable businesses the estimates are deemed reasonable by management based on information available at the dates of acquisition however estimates are i nherently uncertain 

assessment of the potential impairment of goodwill other intangible assets property plant and equipment investments in nonconsolidated affiliates and other assets is an integral part of the companys normal ongoing review of operations testing for potential impairment of these assets is significantly dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects managements best estimates at a particular point in time the dynamic economic environments in which the companys diversified product lines operate and key economic and product line assumptions with respect to projected selling prices market growth and inflation rates can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results ch anges in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments as well as the time in which such impairments are recognized in addition the company continually reviews its diverse portfolio of assets to ensure they are achieving their greatest potential and are aligned with the companys growth strategy strategic decisions involving a particular group of assets may trigger an assessment of the recoverability of the related assets such an assessment could result in impairment losses 

the company performs its annual goodwill impairment testing during the fourth quarter at the reporting unit level which is defined as the operating segment or one level below the operating segment one level below the operating segment or component is a business in which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management the company aggregates certain components into reporting units based on economic similarities the company has seven reporting units of which one reporting unit has no goodwill and is reported within the heldforsale disposal group 

for purposes of goodwill impairment testing the company has the option to first perform qualitative testing to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  the qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors including reporting unit or asset specific operating results and cost factors as well as industry market and macroeconomic conditions to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or asset is less than the respective carrying amount including goodwill if the company chooses not to complete a qualitative assessment for a given reporting unit or if the initial assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that t he carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value additional quantitative testing is required 

if additional quantitative testing is performed an impairment loss is recognized in the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value limited to the amount of goodwill at the reporting unit the company determines fair values for each of the reporting units using a combination of the income approach and market approach 

under the income approach fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at an appropriate riskadjusted rate the company uses internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and includes an estimate of longterm future growth rates based on its most recent views of the longterm outlook for each reporting unit discounted cash flow valuations are completed using the following key assumptions projected revenue projected margins discount rates tax rates and terminal values these key assumptions are determined through evaluation of the company as a whole underlying business fundamentals and industry risk the company derives its discount rates using a capital asset pricing model and analyzing published rates for industries relevant to its reporting units to estimate the cost of equity financing the company uses discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective reporting units and in its internally developed forecasts 

under the market approach the company applies the guideline public company method gpcm selected peer sets are based on close competitors publicly traded companies and reviews of analysts reports public filings and industry research in selecting the ebitebitda multiples and determining the fair value the company considers the size growth and profitability of each reporting unit versus the relevant guideline public companies when applicable third party purchase offers may be utilized to measure fair value 

estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described above could change in future periods 

in the fourth quarter of 2021 the company performed its annual goodwill impairment testing by applying the qualitative assessment to all of its reporting units the company considered various qualitative factors that would have affected the estimated fair value of the reporting units and the results of the qualitative assessments indicated that it is not more likely than not that the fair values of the reporting units were less than their carrying values 

as part of the 2021 segment realignment the company assessed and redefined certain reporting units effective february 1 2021 including reallocation of goodwill on a relative fair value basis as applicable to reporting units impacted a combination of quantitative and qualitative goodwill impairment analyses was then performed for reporting units impacted by this new structure and no impairments were identified 

the company evaluates the carrying value of longlived assets collectively the “asset group” to be held and used when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable the carrying value of a longlived asset group is considered impaired when the anticipated future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset group are less than its carrying value in that event a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the longlived asset group fair value of the asset group is determined using a combination of a discounted cash flow model andor market approach longlived assets to be disposed of by sale if material are classified as held for sale and reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell and depreciation is ceased longlived assets to be disposed of other than by sale are classified as held and used until they are disposed of depreciation is recognized over the remaining useful life of the assets 

valuation of acquired intangible assets 

the company engaged an independent thirdparty valuation specialist to assist with the allocation of the total purchase price for the acquisition of laird performance materials to the fair value of the net assets acquired this required the use of several assumptions and estimates including but not limited to the customer attrition rate the discount rate the royalty rates the economic life the ebitda margin the contributory asset charge and the projected revenue for the customerrelated intangible asset the discount rate the projected revenue the royalty rate the obsolescence rate and the economic life for the developed technology and the discount rate the projected revenue the royalty rate and the economic life for the trademarktradename although the company believes the assumptions and estimates made were reasonable and appropriate these estimates require significant judgment by management and are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from laird performance materials management for further information see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

longterm employee benefits 

the company has various obligations to its employees and retirees the company maintains retirementrelated programs in many countries that have a longterm impact on the companys earnings and cash flows these plans are typically defined benefit pension plans the company has a few medical dental and life insurance benefits for employees pensioners and survivors and for employees other postemployment benefits or opeb plans 

pension coverage for employees of the companys nonus consolidated subsidiaries is provided to the extent deemed appropriate through separate plans the company regularly explores alternative solutions to meet its global pension obligations in the most costeffective manner possible as demographics life expectancy and countryspecific pension funding rules change where permitted by applicable law the company reserves the right to change modify or discontinue its plans that provide pension medical dental and life insurance benefits under defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on years of service and employees pay near retirement 

pension benefits are paid primarily from trust funds established to comply with applicable laws and regulations of the sovereign country in which the pension plan operates unless required by law the company does not make contributions that are in excess of taxdeductible limits the actuarial assumptions and procedures utilized are reviewed periodically by the plans actuaries to provide reasonable assurance that there will be adequate funds for the payment of benefits thus there is not necessarily a direct correlation between pension funding and pension expense in general however improvements in plans funded status tends to moderate subsequent funding needs 

the company contributed 28 million to its funded pension plans for the years ended december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 respectively the company contributed 497 million to its funded pension plans for the year ended december 31 2019 

the company does maintain one us pension benefit plan this plan is a separate unfunded plan and these benefits are paid to employees from operating cash flows the companys remaining pension plans with no plan assets are paid from operating cash flows the company made benefit payments of 60 million 73 million and 72 million to its unfunded plans including opeb plans for the years ended december 31 2021 december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 respectively 

in 2022 the company expects to contribute approximately 90 million to its funded pension plans and its remaining plans with no plan assets the amount and timing of actual future contributions will depend on applicable funding requirements discount rates investment performance plan design and various other factors 

the companys income can be significantly affected by pension and defined contribution chargesbenefits as well as opeb costs the following table summarizes the extent to which the companys income for the years ended december 31 2021 december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 was affected by pretax charges related to longterm employee benefits 



the above charges benefit for pension and opeb are determined as of the beginning of each period see pension plans and other postemployment benefits under the critical accounting estimates section of this report for additional information on determining annual expense 

for 2022 long term employee benefit expense from continuing operations is not expected to change materially as compared to 2021 

environmental matters 

the company operates global manufacturing product handling and distribution facilities that are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations such rules are subject to change by the implementing governmental agency and the company monitors these changes closely company policy requires that all operations fully meet or exceed legal and regulatory requirements 

in addition the company implements various voluntary programs to reduce its environmental footprint which includes initiatives to reduce air emissions minimize the generation of hazardous waste decrease the volume of water use and discharges increase the efficiency of energy use and reduce the generation of persistent bioaccumulative and toxic materials in october 2019 dupont announced its sustainability strategy and 2030 sustainability goals the company’s sustainability strategy and goals prioritize global challenges such as climate change water stewardship advancing circular economy and processes improving health and safety and more with these goals dupont is committed to using the companys strength in innovation to advance progress on several of the united nations’ sustainable development goals increasing resiliency and reducing environmental and social impacts across value chains and ensuring people are put at the center of all the companys work executive responsibility for overall sustainability performance sits with the chief technology  sustainability officer the “ctso” the ctso role was created specifically for dupont to capitalize on the intrinsic link between sustainability and innovation in the company’s operating model the ctso reports directly to the ceo and routinely engages the environmental health safety  sustainability ehss committee of the board of directors on matters of sustainability dupont’s sustainability initiatives and strategy are discussed further in its 2021 sustainability report which is available under sustainability in the about us section of its website this report is not incorporated by reference and should not be considered part of this form 10k 

the costs to comply with complex environmental laws and regulations as well as internal voluntary programs and goals such as dupont’s sustainability strategy are significant and will continue to be significant for the foreseeable future based on existing facts and circumstances management does not believe that yearoveryear changes if any in environmental expenses charged to current operations will have a material impact on the companys financial position liquidity or results of operations annual expenditures in the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures experienced in the past few years longer term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly 

climate change 

the company believes that climate change is an important global environmental issue that presents risks and opportunities the company is continuously evaluating opportunities for existing and new product and service offerings to meet the anticipated demands of a lowcarbon economy as part of dupont’s sustainability strategy the company announced an acting on climate goal the objective of the acting on climate goal is to reduce the company’s greenhouse gas ghg emissions by 30 percent measured from a base year of 2019 including sourcing 60 percent of electricity for operations from renewable energy and delivering carbon neutral operations by 2050 dupont reports on its progress against these goals in its annual sustainability report in 2022 the company plans to include its inaugural tcfd index in its sustainability report and additional climaterelated disclosure in its response to the cdp climate survey 

in line with the objectives of the acting on climate goal dupont signed a virtual power purchase agreement the “vppa” with a subsidiary of nextera energy resources llc in 2021 the vppa will deliver the equivalent of 135 megawatts of new wind power capacity or approximately 528000 megawatt hours mwh of renewable electricity on an annual basis beginning in 2023 

the company is actively engaged in efforts to develop constructive public policies to reduce ghg emissions and encourage lowercarbon forms of energy dupont is part of several organizations including the ceo climate dialogue a collaboration between large companies and ngos working together to advance effective climate legislation in the us dupont is also part of the alliance to save energy which is an organization advocating to advance federal energy efficiency policy as well as other organizations that advocate for clean mobility and renewable fuel 

public policies may bring higher operating costs as well as greater revenue and margin opportunities legislative efforts to control or limit ghg emissions could affect the companys energy source and supply choices as well as increase the cost of energy and raw materials derived from fossil fuels such efforts are also anticipated to provide the business community with greater certainty for the regulatory future help guide investment decisions and drive growth in demand for lowcarbon and energyefficient products technologies and services similarly demand is expected to grow for products that facilitate adaptation to a changing climate however the current unsettled policy environment in the us where many company facilities are located adds an element of uncertainty to business decisions particularly those relating to longterm capital investments 

in addition significant differences in regional or national approaches could present challenges in a global marketplace an effective global climate policy framework will help drive the market changes that are needed to stimulate and efficiently deploy new innovations in science and technology while maintaining open and competitive global markets 

environmental operating costs 

as a result of its operations the company incurs costs for pollution abatement activities including waste collection and disposal installation and maintenance of air pollution controls and wastewater treatment emissions testing and monitoring and obtaining permits the company also incurs costs related to environmental related research and development activities including environmental field and treatment studies as well as toxicity and degradation testing to evaluate the environmental impact of products and raw materials 

environmental remediation 

the company has directly incurred environmental remediation costs of 14 million 6 million and 28 million for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

changes in the remediation accrual balance are summarized below 



1 represents the net change in indemnified remediation obligations based on activity pursuant to the dwdp separation and distribution agreement and letter agreement as discussed below and in notes 4 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements this is not inclusive of the accrual of 116 million related to eligible pfas costs associated with the mou 

considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs and under adverse changes in circumstances the potential liability may range up to 166 million above the amount accrued as of december 31 2021 however based on existing facts and circumstances management does not believe that any loss in excess of amounts accrued related to remediation activities at any individual site will have a material impact on the financial position liquidity or results of operations of the company 

pursuant to the dwdp separation and distribution agreement and the letter agreement discussed in notes 4 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements the company indemnifies dow and corteva for certain environmental matters the company has recorded an indemnification liability of 46 million corresponding to the companys accrual balance related to these matters at december 31 2021 the indemnification liability is included in the total remediation accrual liability of 89 million 

environmental capital expenditures 

capital expenditures for environmental projects either required by law or necessary to meet the company’s internal environmental goals were 40 million for the year ended december 31 2021 this amount includes 11 million of expenditures used towards the companys climate change initiatives the company currently estimates expenditures for environmentalrelated capital projects to be approximately 48 million in 2022 with 19 million estimated for climate change initiatives 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company’s global operations are exposed to financial market risks relating to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates the company has established a variety of programs including the use of derivative instruments and other financial instruments to manage the exposure to financial market risks as to minimize volatility of financial results in the ordinary course of business the company enters into derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign currency interest rate and commodity price risks under established procedures and controls for additional information on these derivatives and related exposures see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements decisions regarding whether or not to hedge a given commitment are made on a casebycase basis taking into consideration the amount and duration of the exposure market volatility and economic trends foreign currency exchange contracts are also used from time to time to manage nearterm foreign currency cash requirements 

foreign currency exchange rate risks 

the company has significant international operations resulting in a large number of currency transactions from international sales purchases investments and borrowings the primary currencies for which the company has an exchange rate exposure are the european euro eur chinese renminbi cny and japanese yen jpy the company uses forward exchange contracts to offset its net exposures by currency related to the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities of its operations in addition to the contracts disclosed in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements from time to time the company will enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to establish with certainty the us dollar usd amount of future firm commitments denominated in a foreign currency 

the following table illustrates the fair values of outstanding foreign currency contracts at december 31 2021 and 2020 and the effect on fair values of a hypothetical adverse change in the foreign exchange rates that existed at december 31 2021 and 2020 the sensitivities for foreign currency contracts are based on a 10 percent adverse change in foreign exchange rates 



the company uses cross currency swaps designated as a net investment hedge to hedge portions of its net investment in its european operations the net investment hedge serves to offset the foreign currency translation risk from the company’s foreign operations if the us dollar weakened by 10 the fair value of the net investment hedge would have been approximately 118 million lower as of december 31 2021 

since the companys risk management programs are highly effective the potential loss in value for each risk management portfolio described above would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure 

concentration of credit risk 

the company maintains cash and cash equivalents marketable securities derivatives and certain other financial instruments with various financial institutions these financial institutions are generally highly rated and geographically dispersed and the company has a policy to limit the dollar amount of credit exposure with any one institution 

as part of the companys financial risk management processes it continuously evaluates the relative credit standing of all of the financial institutions that service dupont and monitors actual exposures versus established limits the company has not sustained credit losses from instruments held at financial institutions 

the companys sales are not materially dependent on any single customer as of december 31 2021 no one individual customer balance represented more than five percent of the companys total outstanding receivables balance credit risk associated with its receivables balance is representative of the geographic industry and customer diversity associated with the companys global product lines 

the company also maintains strong credit controls in evaluating and granting customer credit as a result it may require that customers provide some type of financial guarantee in certain circumstances length of terms for customer credit varies by industry and region

 item 1a risk factors 

the companys operations could be affected by various risks many of which are beyond its control based on current information the company believes that the following identifies the most material risk factors that could affect its operations past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 

risks relating to the nb transaction and the dow and corteva distributions 

the separation and combination of dupont’s nutrition  biosciences business with iff could result in significant tax liability to dupont 

following the nb merger nb is expected to merge with and into neptune merger sub ii llc a wholly owned subsidiary of iff “merger sub ii” with merger sub ii surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of iff the “second merger” and together with the nb merger the “mergers” 

the distribution by dupont to its stockholders of all the issued and outstanding shares of nb through the exchange offer nb distribution and mergers are expected to be taxfree to dupont stockholders for us federal income tax purposes except to the extent that cash is paid to dupont stockholders in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to the merger agreement and the nb contribution nb distribution and special cash payment are expected to result in no recognition of gain or loss by dupont for us federal income tax purposes 

dupont has received an opinion from skadden arps slate meagher  flom llp regarding i the qualification of the separation and transfer by dupont of its nb business the nb contribution nb distribution and special cash payment as a “reorganization” within the meaning of sections 368a 361 and 355 of the internal revenue code of 1986 the “code” ii the nonrecognition of gain or loss by dupont on receipt of the special cash payment subject to certain conditions iii the qualification of the nb distribution as a distribution described in section 355 and to which section 355e does not apply and iv the qualification of the mergers as a “reorganization” within the meaning of section 368a of the code this opinion is based upon and rely on among other things certain facts and assumptions as well as certain representations statements and undertakings of dupont nb iff and merger sub 1 and merger sub ii if any of these representations statements or undertakings are or become inaccurate or incomplete or if any party breaches any of its covenants in the relevant transaction documents the opinion may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized notwithstanding the receipt of such opinion the internal revenue service the “irs” could determine that the separation of dupont’s nutrition  biosciences business should be treated as a taxable transaction if it determines that any of the facts assumptions representations statements or undertakings upon which the opinion of counsel was based are false or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion an opinion of counsel is not binding on the irs and there can be no assurance that the irs will not assert a contrary position 

dupont has also obtained a private letter ruling from the irs regarding certain matters impacting the us federal income tax treatment of the nb contribution nb distribution special cash payment and certain related transactions the conclusions of the irs private letter ruling were based among other things on various factual assumptions dupont authorized and representations dupont made to the irs if any of assumptions or representations are or become inaccurate or incomplete reliance on the irs private letter ruling may be affected 

if the nb contribution and nb distribution failed to qualify for the treatment described above dupont would be required to generally recognize taxable gain on the transactions and stockholders of dupont who receive nb common stock and subsequently iff common stock would be subject to tax on their receipt of the nb common stock additionally if the special cash payment or certain internal transactions related to the separation of the nutrition  biosciences business fail to qualify for their intended taxfree treatment under us federal state local tax andor foreign tax law dupont could incur additional tax liabilities 

under the tax matters agreement by and between dupont with nb and iff nb or iff is generally be required to indemnify dupont for any taxes resulting from the separation of the nutrition  biosciences business and any related costs and other damages to the extent such amounts resulted from i certain actions taken by nb or iff involving the capital stock of nb or iff or any assets of the nb group excluding actions required by the documents governing the proposed transactions or ii any breach of certain representations and covenants made by nb or iff 

dupont is subject to continuing contingent taxrelated liabilities of dow and corteva following the separations and dwdp distributions 

after the separations and dwdp distributions there are several significant areas where the liabilities of dow and corteva may become the company’s obligations either in whole or in part for example to the extent that any subsidiary of the company 

was included in the consolidated tax reporting group of either tdcc or eid for any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the effective date of the dwdp merger such subsidiary is jointly and severally liable for the us federal income tax liability of the entire consolidated tax reporting group of tdcc or eid as applicable for such taxable period in connection with the separations and dwdp distributions dupont dow and corteva have entered into a tax matters agreement as amended that allocates the responsibility for prior period consolidated taxes among dow corteva and dupont if dow or corteva are unable to pay any prior period taxes for which it is responsible however dupont could be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes and such amounts could be significant other provisions of federal state local or foreign law may establish similar liability for other matters including laws governing taxqualified pension plans as well as other contingent liabilities 

in connection with the separations and dwdp distributions certain liabilities are allocated to or retained by dupont through assumption or indemnification of dow andor corteva as applicable if dupont is required to make payments pursuant to these indemnities to dow andor corteva dupont may need to divert cash to meet those obligations and the company’s financial results could be negatively impacted in addition certain liabilities are allocated to or retained by dow andor corteva through assumption or indemnification or subject to indemnification by other third parties these indemnities may not be sufficient to insure the company against the full amount of liabilities including pfas stray liabilities allocated to or retained by it and dow corteva andor third parties may not be able to satisfy their respective indemnification obligations in the future 

pursuant to the dwdp separation and distribution agreement the dwdp employee matters agreement and the dwdp tax matters agreement as amended collectively the “core agreements” with dow and corteva as well as the letter agreement between dupont and corteva dupont has agreed to assume and indemnify dow and corteva for certain liabilities see discussion of the core agreements in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements and litigation and environmental matters in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements payments pursuant to these indemnities may be significant and could negatively impact the company’s business particularly indemnities relating to the company’s actions that could impact the taxfree nature of the distributions third parties could also seek to hold it responsible for any of the liabilities allocated to dow and corteva including those related to eid’s materials science andor agriculture businesses or for the conduct of such businesses prior to the distributions and such third parties could seek damages other monetary penalties whether civil or criminal andor other remedies additionally dupont generally assumes and is responsible for the payment of the company’s share of i certain liabilities of dowdupont relating to arising out of or resulting from certain general corporate matters of dupont and ii certain separation expenses not otherwise allocated to corteva or dow or allocated specifically to it pursuant to the core agreements and third parties could seek to hold it responsible for dow’s or corteva’s share of any such liabilities dow andor corteva as applicable have agreed to indemnify it for such liabilities however such indemnities may not be sufficient to protect it against the full amount of such liabilities or from other remedies and dow andor corteva as applicable may not be able to fully satisfy their indemnification obligations even if dupont ultimately succeeds in recovering from dow andor corteva as applicable any amounts for which dupont are held liable dupont may be temporarily required to bear these losses each of these risks could negatively affect the company’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

generally as described in litigation and environmental matters losses related from liabilities related to discontinued andor divested operations and businesses of eid that are not primarily related to its agriculture business or specialty products business “stray liabilities” are allocated to or shared by each of corteva and dupont stray liabilities include liabilities arising out of actions to the extent related to or resulting from eid’s development testing manufacture or sale of per or polyfluoroalkyl substances “pfas stray liabilities” 

although the company believes it is remote there can be no assurance that any such third party would have adequate resources to satisfy its indemnification obligation when due or would not ultimately be successful in claiming defenses against payment even if recovery from the third party is ultimately successful dupont may be temporarily required to bear these losses each of these risks could negatively affect the company’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements and the risk factor below regarding the dupont corteva and chemours cost sharing arrangement related to future eligible pfas liabilities 

if the completed distribution of corteva or dow in each case together with certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for nonrecognition treatment for us federal income tax purposes then the company could be subject to significant tax and indemnification liability 

the completed distributions of corteva and dow were each conditioned upon the receipt of an opinion from skadden arps slate meagher  flom llp the company’s tax counsel regarding the qualification of the applicable distribution along with certain related transactions as a taxfree transaction under section 355 and section 368a1d of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” and such opinions collectively the “tax opinions” the tax opinions relied on certain facts assumptions and undertakings and certain representations from the company dow and corteva as applicable as well 

as the irs ruling as defined below notwithstanding the tax opinions and the irs ruling the internal revenue service the “irs” could determine on audit that either or both of the distributions and certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or that the distributions should be taxable for other reasons including if the irs were to disagree with the conclusions of the tax opinions 

even if a distribution otherwise constituted a taxfree transaction to stockholders under section 355 of the code the company could be required to recognize corporate level tax on such distribution and certain related transactions under section 355e of the code if the irs determines that as a result of the dwdp merger or other transactions considered part of a plan with such distribution there was a 50 percent or greater change in ownership in the company dow or corteva as relevant in connection with the dwdp merger the company sought and received a private letter ruling from the irs regarding the proper time manner and methodology for measuring common ownership in the stock of the company eid and tdcc for purposes of determining whether there was a 50 percent or greater change of ownership under section 355e of the code as a result of the dwdp merger the “irs ruling” the tax opinions relied on the continued validity of the irs ruling and representations made by the company as to the common ownership of the stock of tdcc and eid immediately prior to the dwdp merger and concluded that there was not a 50 percent or greater change of ownership for purposes of section 355e as a result of the dwdp merger notwithstanding the tax opinions and the irs ruling the irs could determine that a distribution or a related transaction should nevertheless be treated as a taxable transaction to the company if it determines that any of the company’s facts assumptions representations or undertakings was not correct or that a distribution should be taxable for other reasons including if the irs were to disagree with the conclusions in the tax opinions that are not covered by the irs ruling 

generally corporate taxes resulting from the failure of a distribution to qualify for nonrecognition treatment for us federal income tax purposes would be imposed on the company under the dwdp tax matters agreement as amended that the company entered into with dow and corteva dow and corteva are generally obligated to indemnify the company against any such taxes imposed on it however if a distribution fails to qualify for nonrecognition treatment for us federal income tax purposes for certain reasons relating to the overall structure of the dwdp merger and the distributions then under the dwdp tax matters agreement as amended the company and corteva on the one hand and dow on the other hand would share the tax liability resulting from such failure in accordance with the relative equity values of the company and dow on the first full trading day following the distribution of dow and the company and corteva would in turn share any such resulting tax liability in accordance with the relative equity values of the company and corteva on the first full trading day following the distribution of corteva furthermore under the terms of the dwdp tax matters agreement as amended a party also generally will be responsible for any taxes imposed on the other parties that arise from the failure of either distribution to qualify as taxfree for us federal income tax purposes within the meaning of section 355 of the code or the failure of certain related transactions to qualify for taxfree treatment to the extent such failure to qualify is attributable to actions events or transactions relating to such party or such partys affiliates’ stock assets or business or any breach of such partys representations made in connection with the irs ruling or in any representation letter provided to a tax advisor in connection with certain tax opinions including the tax opinions regarding the taxfree status of the distributions and certain related transactions to the extent that the company is responsible for any liability under the dwdp tax matters agreement as amended there could be a material adverse impact on the companys business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in future reporting periods 

the dwdp separations and dwdp distributions and the nb transaction may expose the company to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal distribution requirements 

although in connection with the dwdp distributions and in connection with the nb transaction dupont received separate solvency opinions from investment banks confirming that dupont dow corteva and nb would each be adequately capitalized following the separations and dwdp distributions and the nb transactions as relevant the “transactions” the transactions could be challenged under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws fraudulent conveyances or transfers are generally defined to include transfers made or obligations incurred with the actual intent to hinder delay or defraud current or future creditors or transfers made or obligations incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value when the debtor was insolvent or that rendered the debtor insolvent inadequately capitalized or unable to pay its debts as they become due any unpaid creditor could claim that dupont did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value in any of the transactions and that any one or the aggregate of the transactions left dupont insolvent or with unreasonably small capital or that dupont intended or believed dupont would incur debts beyond the company’s ability to pay such debts as they mature if a court were to agree with such a plaintiff then such court could void the separations and distributions as a fraudulent transfer or impose substantial liabilities on it which could adversely affect the company’s financial condition and the company’s results of operations 

the transactions are also subject to review under state corporate distribution statutes under the delaware general corporation law a corporation may only pay dividends to its stockholders either i out of its surplus net assets minus capital or ii if there is no such surplus out of its net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared andor the preceding fiscal 

year although dupont’s board of directors made the distributions out of dupont’s surplus and received an opinion that dupont had adequate surplus under delaware law to declare the dividends of corteva and dow common stock in connection with the dwdp distributions there can be no assurance that a court will not later determine that some or all of the distributions were unlawful 

on january 22 2021 dupont corteva and chemours entered into a cost sharing arrangement related to future eligible pfas costs the company’s results of operations could be adversely affected by litigation and other commitments and contingencies including expected performance under and impact of the cost sharing arrangement 

although by reducing uncertainty the company expects to benefit from the cost sharing arrangement related to future pfas eligible costs achievement of any such benefits may not be realized and depend on a number of factors and uncertainties that include but are not limited to the achievement terms and conditions of final agreements related to the cost sharing arrangement the outcome of any pending or future litigation related to pfas or pfoa including personal injury claims and natural resource damages claims the extent and cost of ongoing remediation obligations and potential future remediation obligations changes in laws and regulations applicable to pfas chemicals the performance by each of the parties of their respective obligations under the cost sharing arrangement 

dupont faces risks arising from various unasserted and asserted litigation matters including product liability patent infringement and other intellectual property disputes contract and commercial litigation claims for damage or personal injury antitrust claims governmental regulations and other actions an adverse outcome in any one or more of these matters could be material to the company’s business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in the ordinary course of business dupont may make certain commitments including representations warranties and indemnities relating to current and past operations including those related to divested businesses and dupont may issue guarantees of thirdparty obligations if dupont is required to make payments as a result they could exceed the amounts accrued therefor thereby adversely affecting the company’s results of operations 

risks relating to dupont’s business and results of operations 

the extent to which the novel coronavirus covid19 and measures taken in response to it impact dupont’s business results of operations access to sources of liquidity and financial condition depends on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted 

dupont is actively monitoring the global impacts of covid19 including the impacts from responsive measures and remains focused on its top priorities  the safety and health of its employees and the needs of its customers the company’s business and financial condition and the business and financial condition of the company’s customers and suppliers have been impacted by the significantly increased economic and demand uncertainties created by the covid19 outbreak in addition public and private sector responsive measures such as the imposition of travel restrictions quarantines adoption of remote working and suspension of nonessential business and government services have impacted the company’s business and financial condition many of dupont’s facilities and employees are based in areas impacted by the virus while most dupont manufacturing sites remain in operation dupont has reduced or furloughed certain operations in response to government measures employee welfare concerns and the impact of covid19 on the global demand and supply chain dupont’s manufacturing operations may be further adversely affected by impacts from covid19 including among other things additional government actions and other responsive measures more and or deeper supply chain disruptions quarantines and health and availability of essential onsite personnel in response the company developed sitebysite protocols in 2020 under which the company continues to operate these protocols include preentrance screening restricting visitor access social distancing and masking requirements additional sanitization and disinfecting requirements restrictions on all nonessential travel and implementation of workfromhome protocols the suspension of travel and doing business inperson has increased the company’s exposure to cybersecurity risks and could negatively impact the companys innovation and marketing efforts challenge the ability to deliver against the company’s strategic priorities and to otherwise transact business in a timely manner or create operational or other challenges any of which could harm dupont’s business furthermore covid19 continues to adversely impact the broader global economy including negatively impacting economic growth and creating disruption and volatility in the global financial and capital markets which could result in increases in the cost of capital andor adversely impact the availability of and access to capital which could negatively affect dupont’s liquidity dupont is unable to predict the extent of covid19 related impacts on its business results of operations access to sources of liquidity and financial condition which depends on highly uncertain and unpredictable future developments including but not limited to the duration and spread of the covid19 outbreak its severity the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions resume dupont’s financial results may be materially and adversely impacted by a variety of factors that have not yet been determined including potential impairments of goodwill and other assets dupont is taking actions including reducing costs restructuring actions and delaying certain capital expenditures and nonessential spend in addition the company may consider further reductions in or furloughing additional operations in response to further andor deeper declines in demand andor or supply chain disruptions there can be no guaranty that such actions will significantly mitigate the 

impact of covid19 on the company’s business results of operations access to sources of liquidity or financial condition after the covid19 outbreak has subsided dupont may experience materially adverse impacts to its business results of operations and financial condition as a result of related global economic impacts including any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future 

supply chain disruptions and volatility in energy and raw material costs could have a significant impact on the company’s sales and earnings 

the company’s manufacturing processes depend on the continued availability of energy and raw materials the costs of which are subject to worldwide supply and demand as well as other factors beyond the company’s control including potential legislation to address climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions creating a carbon tax or implementing a cap and trade program which could create increases in energy costs and price volatility supply chain disruptions plant andor power outages labor disputes andor strikes geopolitical activity weather events and natural disasters including hurricanes or flooding that impact coastal regions and global health risks or pandemics could seriously harm the company’s operations as well as the operations of the company’s customers and suppliers in addition the company’ suppliers may experience capacity limitations in their own operations or may elect to reduce or eliminate certain product lines to address this risk generally the company seeks to have many sources of supply for key raw materials in order to avoid significant dependence on any one or a few suppliers in addition and where the supply market for key raw materials is concentrated dupont takes additional steps to manage its exposure to supply chain risk and price fluctuations through among other things negotiated longterm contracts some which include minimum purchase obligations although there can be no assurance that such mitigation efforts will prevent future difficulty in obtaining sufficient and timely delivery of certain raw materials dupont believes it has adequate programs to ensure a reliable supply of key raw materials 

dupont also takes actions to offset the effects of higher energy and raw material costs through selling price increases productivity improvements and cost reduction programs success in offsetting higher raw material costs with price increases is largely influenced by competitive and economic conditions and could vary significantly depending on the market served as a result volatility in these costs may negatively impact the company’s business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the company’s business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected by interruption of the company’s information technology or network systems and other business disruptions 

dupont relies on centralized and local information technology networks and systems some of which are managed or accessible by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to otherwise manage or support its business additionally the company collects and stores certain data including proprietary business information and has access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations and customerimposed controls 

information technology system andor network disruptions whether caused by acts of sabotage employee error malfeasance or other actions could have an adverse impact on the company’s operations as well as the operations of the company’s customers and suppliers other business disruptions may also be caused by security breaches which could include for example attacks on information technology and infrastructure by hackers viruses breaches due to employee error malfeasance or other actions or other disruptions dupont andor the company’s suppliers may fail to effectively prevent detect and recover from these or other security breaches and therefore such breaches could result in misuse of the company’s assets loss of property including trade secrets and confidential or personal information some of which is subject to privacy and security laws and other business disruptions as a result dupont may be subject to legal claims or proceedings reporting errors processing inefficiencies negative media attention loss of sales interference with regulatory compliance which could result in sanctions or penalties liability or penalties under privacy laws disruption in the company’s operations and damage to the company’s reputation which could adversely affect the company’s business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

like most major corporations dupont is the target of industrial espionage including cyberattacks from time to time dupont is experiencing an increase in attempts to breach its information technology systems including in conjunction with implementation of workfromhome protocols adopted in response to covid19 these cybersecurity threats include phishing spam emails hacking social engineering and malicious software dupont has determined that these attacks have resulted and could result in the future in unauthorized parties gaining access to certain confidential business information although management does not believe that dupont has experienced any material losses to date related to these security breaches including cybersecurity incidents there can be no assurance that dupont will not suffer such losses in the future 

dupont seeks to actively manage the risks within the company’s control that could lead to business disruptions and security breaches as these threats continue to evolve particularly around cybersecurity dupont may be required to expend significant 

resources to enhance the company’s control environment processes practices and other protective measures despite these efforts such events could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

enforcing the company’s intellectual property rights or defending against intellectual property claims asserted by others could adversely affect the company’s business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

intellectual property rights including patents trade secrets knowhow and other confidential information trademarks tradenames and other forms of trade dress are important to the company’s business dupont endeavors to protect the company’s intellectual property rights in jurisdictions in which the company’s products are produced or used and in jurisdictions into which the company’s products are imported however dupont may be unable to obtain protection for the company’s intellectual property in key jurisdictions further changes in government policies and regulations including changes made in reaction to pressure from nongovernmental organizations or the public generally could impact the extent of intellectual property protection afforded by such jurisdictions 

dupont has designed and implemented internal controls intended to restrict access to and distribution of the company’s intellectual property despite these precautions the company’s intellectual property is vulnerable to unauthorized access through employee error or actions theft and cybersecurity incidents and other security breaches when unauthorized access and use or counterfeit products are discovered dupont considers the matter for report to governmental authorities for investigation as appropriate and takes measures to mitigate any potential impact protecting intellectual property related to biotechnology is particularly challenging because theft is difficult to detect and biotechnology can be selfreplicating accordingly the impact of such theft can be significant 

competitors are increasingly challenging the company’s intellectual property positions and the potential outcomes can be highly uncertain third parties may also claim the company’s products violate their intellectual property rights defending such claims even those without merit is timeconsuming and expensive in addition as a result of such claims dupont has and could be required in the future to enter into license agreements develop noninfringing products or engage in litigation that could be costly if challenges are resolved adversely it could negatively impact the company’s ability to obtain licenses on competitive terms commercialize new products and generate sales from existing products 

in addition because of the rapid pace of technological change the confidentiality of patent applications in some jurisdictions andor the uncertainty in predicting the outcome of complex proceedings relating to ownership or the scope of protection of patents relating to certain emerging technologies competitors may be unexpectedly issued patents that dupont does not anticipate these patents could reduce the value of the company’s commercial or pipeline products or to the extent they cover key technologies on which dupont has unknowingly relied require it to seek to obtain licenses or cease using the technology no matter how valuable to the company’s business if dupont decided to obtain licenses to continue using the technology it cannot ensure dupont would be able to obtain such a license on acceptable terms 

legislation and jurisprudence on patent protection is evolving and changes in laws could affect the company’s ability to obtain or maintain patent protection for the company’s products 

any one or more of the above factors could significantly affect the company’s business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets could negatively impact the company’s financial results 

at least annually dupont must assess both goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment intangible assets with finite lives are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable if testing indicates that goodwill or intangible assets are impaired their carrying values will be written down based on fair values with a charge against earnings where dupont utilizes discounted cash flow methodologies in determining fair values continued weak demand for a specific product line or business could result in an impairment accordingly any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of goodwill or intangible assets could negatively impact the company’s results of operations 

as a result of the dwdp merger and related acquisition method of accounting eid’s assets and liabilities were measured at fair value and any declines in projected cash flows could have a material negative impact on the fair value of the company’s reporting units and assets future impairments of the company’s goodwill or intangible assets also could be recorded due to changes in assumptions estimates or circumstances and the magnitude of such impairments may be material to it 

failure to effectively manage acquisitions divestitures alliances and other portfolio actions could adversely impact the company’s business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

dupont continuously evaluates acquisition candidates including significant transactions that may strategically fit the company’s business andor growth objectives if dupont is unable to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses dupont could fail to achieve anticipated synergies and cost savings including any expected increases in revenues and operating results which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results dupont expects to continually review the company’s portfolio of assets for contributions to the company’s objectives and alignment with the company’s growth strategy the letter agreement between the company and corteva limits dupont’s ability to separate certain businesses and assets to third parties without assigning certain of its indemnification obligations under the dwdp separation and distribution agreement to the transferee of such businesses and assets or meeting certain other alternative conditions dupont may be unable to meet the conditions under the letter agreement if applicable even if the conditions under the letter agreement are met or are not applicable dupont may not be successful in separating underperforming or nonstrategic assets and gains or losses on the divestiture of or lost operating income from such assets may affect the company’s earnings moreover dupont might incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures that reduce the company’s earnings in addition if the execution or implementation of acquisitions divestitures alliances joint ventures and other portfolio actions is not successful andor the company fails to effectively manage its cost as its portfolio evolves it could adversely impact the company’s business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

failure to maintain a streamlined operating model and sustain operational improvements may reduce the company’s profitability or adversely impact the company’s business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the company’s profitability and margin growth will depend in part on the company’s ability to maintain a streamlined operating model and drive sustainable improvements through actions and projects such as consolidation of manufacturing facilities transitions to costcompetitive regions and product line rationalizations a variety of factors may adversely affect the company’s ability to realize the targeted cost synergies including failure to successfully optimize the company’s facilities footprint the failure to take advantage of the company’s global supply chain the failure to identify and eliminate duplicative programs there can be no assurance that dupont is be able to achieve or sustain any or all of the cost savings generated from restructuring actions 

failure to attract and retain talented people with the necessary knowledge and experience could adversely affect company’s ability to compete and achieve its strategic goals 

attracting developing and retaining talented employees is essential to the company’s successful delivery of products and services ability to innovate including developing new products and technologies and ability to identify trends and develop new markets 

competition for employees can be intense if the company is unable to successfully integrate motivate and reward its employees it may not be able to retain them or attract new employee in the future which could adversely impact the company’s ability to effectively compete 

risks relating to capital resources and liquidity 

changes in the company’s credit ratings could increase the company’s cost of borrowing or restrict the company’s ability to access debt capital markets the company’s credit ratings are important to the company’s cost of capital 

dupont relies on access to the debt capital markets and other shortterm borrowings to finance the company’s longterm and daytoday operations a decrease in the ratings assigned to it by the ratings agencies may negatively impact the company’s access to the debt capital markets and increase the company’s cost of borrowing the major rating agencies will routinely evaluate the company’s credit profile and assign debt ratings to it this evaluation is based on a number of factors which include weighing the company’s financial strength versus business industry and financial risk the addition of further leverage to the company’s capital structure could impact the company’s credit ratings failure to maintain an investment grade rating at the company’s current level would adversely affect the company’s cost of funding and the company’s results of operations and could adversely affect the company’s liquidity and access to the capital markets any limitation on the company’s ability to continue to raise money in the debt capital markets could have a substantial negative effect on the company’s liquidity if dupont is unable to generate sufficient cash flow or maintain access to adequate external financing including from significant disruptions in the global credit markets it could restrict the company’s current operations activities under its current and future stock buyback programs and the company’s growth opportunities which could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

a significant percentage of the company’s net sales are generated from the company’s international operations and are subject to economic foreign exchange and other risks 

dupont does business globally in about 60 countries the percentage of net sales generated by the international operations of dupont including us exports was approximately 70 percent of net sales on a continuing operations basis for the year ended 

december 31 2020 with asia pacific as the company’s largest region dupont expects the percentage of the company’s net sales derived from international operations to continue to be significant risks related to international operations include 

• exchange control regulations 

• fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 

• foreign investment laws 

the company’s international operations expose it to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar which could adversely affect the company’s results of operations for its continuing operations as of the year ended december 31 2020 the company’s largest currency exposures are the european euro chinese renminbi and japanese yen us dollar fluctuations against foreign currency have an impact to commercial prices and raw material costs in some cases and could result in local price increases if the price or raw material costs is denominated in us dollar 

sales and expenses of the company’s nonus businesses are also translated into us dollars for reporting purposes and fluctuations of foreign currency against the us dollar could impact us dollardenominated earnings in addition the company’s assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies can also be impacted by foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar which could result in exchange gain or loss from revaluation 

dupont also faces exchange rate risk from the company’s investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries 

dupont has a balance sheet hedging program and actively looks for opportunities in managing currency exposures related to earnings however foreign exchange hedging activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to it or be successful in completely mitigating such exposures 

dupont generates significant amounts of cash outside of the united states that is invested with financial and nonfinancial counterparties while dupont employs comprehensive controls regarding global cash management to guard against cash or investment loss and to ensure the company’s ability to fund the company’s operations and commitments a material disruption to the counterparties with whom dupont transacts business could expose it to financial loss 

any one or more of the above factors could adversely affect the company’s international operations and could significantly affect the company’s business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

risks related to regulatory changes and compliance 

the costs of complying with evolving regulatory requirements could negatively impact the company’s business results of operations financial condition and cash flows actual or alleged violations of environmental laws or permit requirements could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations and substantial civil or criminal sanctions as well as the assessment of strict liability andor joint and several liability 

dupont continues to be subject to extensive federal state local and foreign laws regulations rules and ordinances relating to pollution protection of the environment greenhouse gas emissions and the generation storage handling transportation treatment disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials costs and capital expenditures relating to environmental health or safety matters are subject to evolving regulatory requirements and depend on the timing of the promulgation and enforcement of specific standards which impose the requirements moreover changes in environmental regulations could inhibit or interrupt the company’s operations or require modifications to the company’s facilities changes to regulations or the implementation of additional regulations may result in significant costs or capital expenditures or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced margins or profitability 

accordingly environmental health or safety regulatory matters could result in significant unanticipated costs or liabilities causing a negative impact on the company’s business cash flows and results of operations 

the company’s business results of operations and reputation could be adversely affected by industryspecific risks including process safety and product stewardshipregulatory compliance issues 

dupont is subject to risks which include but are not limited to product safety or quality shifting consumer preferences federal state and local regulations on manufacturing or labeling environmental health and safety regulations and customer product liability claims while dupont maintains general liability insurance the amount of liability that may result from certain of these risks may not always be covered by or could exceed the applicable insurance coverage in addition negative publicity related to product liability food safety safety health and environmental matters may damage the company’s reputation the occurrence of any of the matters described above could adversely affect the company’s business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in most jurisdictions dupont must test the safety efficacy and environmental impact of the company’s products to satisfy regulatory requirements and obtain the needed approvals in certain jurisdictions dupont must periodically renew the company’s approvals which may require it to demonstrate compliance with thencurrent standards the regulatory approvals process is lengthy complex and in some markets unpredictable with requirements that can vary by product technology industry and country additionally the regulatory environment may be impacted by the activities of nongovernmental organizations and special interest groups and stakeholder reactions to the actual or perceived impacts of new technology products or processes on safety health and the environment obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals will require submitting a significant amount of information and data which may require participation from technology providers regulatory standards and trial procedures are continuously changing the pace of change together with the lack of regulatory harmony could result in unintended noncompliance to maintain the company’s right to produce or sell existing products or to commercialize new products dupont must be able to demonstrate the company’s ability to satisfy the requirements of regulatory agencies 

the failure to meet existing and new requirements or receive necessary permits or approvals could have near and longterm effects on the company’s ability to produce and sell certain current and future products which could significantly increase operating costs and adversely affect the company’s business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

increased concerns regarding chemicals in commerce and their potential impact on the environment have resulted in more restrictive regulations may lead to new regulations and compliance may be costly 

concerns about chemicals and biotechnology as well as their potential impact on health and the environment reflect a growing trend in societal demands for increasing levels of product safety and environmental protection these concerns could manifest themselves in stockholder proposals preferred purchasing delays or failures in obtaining or retaining regulatory approvals delayed product launches lack of market acceptance product discontinuation continued pressure for and adoption of more stringent regulatory intervention and litigation these concerns could also influence public perceptions the viability or continued sales of certain of the company’s products the company’s reputation and the cost to comply with regulations and as a result could have a negative impact on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

the company’s us and nonus tax liabilities will be dependent in part upon the distribution of income among various jurisdictions in which dupont operates 

the company’s future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in tax laws regulations and judicial rulings or changes in the interpretation thereof changes in generally accepted accounting principles changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of the company’s tax exposures and various other governmental enforcement initiatives the company’s tax expense includes estimates of tax reserves and reflects other estimates and assumptions including assessments of future earnings of the company which could impact the valuation of the company’s deferred tax assets changes in tax laws or regulations including further regulatory developments arising from us tax reform legislation as well as multijurisdictional changes enacted in response to the action items provided by the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd will increase tax uncertainty and impact the company’s provision for income taxes 

general risks that may impact the company’s business 

the company’s results will be affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences 

demand for the company’s products which impacts revenue and profit margins will be affected by i the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products ii the company’s response to downward pricing trends to stay competitive iii changes in customer order patterns such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes changes in the company’s incentive programs or the customer’s ability to achieve incentive goals iv the impact of tariffs or trade disputes on availability of raw materials and v changes in customers’ preferences for the company’s products including the success of products offered by the company’s competitors and changes in customer’s designs for their products that can affect the demand for some of the company’s products 

additionally success in achieving the company’s growth objectives is significantly dependent on the timing and market acceptance of the company’s new product offerings including the company’s ability to renew the company’s pipeline of new product offerings and to bring those offerings to market this ability may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development such as the inability to identify viable new products obtain adequate intellectual property protection or gain market acceptance of new products there are no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful the company’s success will depend on several factors including the company’s ability to 

• correctly identify customer needs and preferences and predict future needs and preferences 

• allocate the company’s research  development funding to products and services with higher growth prospects 

• anticipate and respond to the company’s competitors’ development of new products and services and technological innovations

cash flows from operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities was 4095 million and 1409 million for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively cash provided by operating activities increased in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to a release of cash from net working capital in 2020 versus a use of cash for net working capital in the prior period partially offset by lower earnings versus the prior period cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2018 was 4731 million cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily driven by the impact of the dwdp distributions of the materials science and agriculture businesses to period earnings partially offset by a decrease in the use of cash for net working capital versus the prior period 



cash flows from investing activities 

cash used for investing activities in 2020 was 202 million compared to cash used for investing of 2313 million in 2019 the decrease in cash used was primarily attributable to lower capital expenditures and an increase in proceeds from sales of property and businesses partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from sales and maturities of investments cash used for investing activities in 2018 was 2462 million primarily driven by capital expenditures and purchases of investments which were partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of investments and proceeds from interests in trade accounts receivable conduits 

capital expenditures totaled 1194 million for the year ended december 31 2020 2472 million for the year ended december 31 2019 and 3837 million for the year ended december 31 2018 the company expects 2021 capital expenditures to be approximately 825 million the company may adjust its spending throughout the year as economic conditions develop

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements 

critical accounting estimates 

the companys significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the companys operating results and financial condition 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts including but not limited to receivable and inventory valuations impairment of tangible and intangible assets longterm employee benefit obligations income taxes restructuring liabilities environmental matters and litigation managements estimates are based on historical experience facts and circumstances available at the time and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable the company reviews these matters and reflects changes in estimates as appropriate management believes that the following represent some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the companys accounting policies which could have a material effect on the companys financial position liquidity or results of operations 

pension plans 

accounting for employee benefit plans involves numerous assumptions and estimates discount rate and expected return on plan assets are two critical assumptions in measuring the cost and benefit obligation of the companys pension plans management reviews these two key assumptions when plans are remeasured these and other assumptions are updated periodically to reflect the actual experience and expectations on a plan specific basis as appropriate as permitted by gaap actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated on a plan by plan basis and to the extent that such differences exceed 10 percent of the greater of the plans benefit obligation or the applicable plan assets the excess is amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees or the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants if all or almost all of a plan’s participants are inactive 

for the majority of the benefit plans the company utilizes the aon aa corporate bond yield curves to determine the discount rate applicable to each country at the measurement date 

the company establishes strategic asset allocation percentage targets and appropriate benchmarks for significant asset classes in accordance with the laws and practices of those countries where appropriate assetliability studies are also taken into consideration for plans the longterm expected return on plan assets pension expense is determined using the fair value of assets 

the following table highlights the potential impact on the companys pretax earnings due to changes in certain key assumptions with respect to the companys pension plans based on assets and liabilities at december 31 2020 



additional information with respect to pension plans liabilities and assumptions is discussed under longterm employee benefits beginning on page 57 and in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements 

legal contingencies 

the companys results of operations could be affected by significant litigation adverse to the company including product liability claims patent infringement and antitrust claims and claims for third party property damage or personal injury stemming from alleged environmental torts the company records accruals for legal matters when the information available indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated management makes adjustments to these accruals to reflect the impact and status of negotiations settlements rulings advice of counsel and other information and events that may pertain to a particular matter predicting the outcome of claims and lawsuits and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates in making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters management considers many factors these factors include but are not limited to the nature of specific claims including unasserted claims the companys experience with similar types of claims the jurisdiction in which the matter is filed input from outside legal counsel the likelihood of resolving the matter through alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and the matters current status considerable judgment is required in determining whether to establish a litigation accrual when an adverse judgment is rendered against the company in a court proceeding in such situations the company will not recognize a loss if based upon a thorough review of all relevant facts and information management believes that it is probable that the pending judgment will be successfully overturned on appeal a detailed discussion of significant litigation matters is contained in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

the breadth of the companys operations and the global complexity of tax regulations require assessments of uncertainties and judgments in estimating taxes the company will ultimately pay the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions outcomes of tax litigation and resolution of disputes arising from federal state and international tax audits in the normal course of business the resolution of these uncertainties may result in adjustments to the companys tax assets and tax liabilities it is reasonably possible that changes to the company’s global unrecognized tax benefits could be significant however due to the uncertainty regarding the timing of completion of audits and possible outcomes a current estimate of the range of increases or decreases that may occur within the next twelve months cannot be made 

deferred income taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of the companys assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets the realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies for example changes in facts and circumstances that alter the probability that the company will realize deferred tax assets could result in recording a valuation allowance thereby reducing the deferred tax asset and generating a deferred tax expense in the relevant period in some situations these changes could be material 

at december 31 2020 the company had a net deferred tax liability balance of 27 billion net of a valuation allowance of 07 billion realization of deferred tax assets is expected to occur over an extended period of time as a result changes in tax laws assumptions with respect to future taxable income and tax planning strategies could result in adjustments to deferred tax assets see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details related to the deferred tax liability balance 

goodwill 

the assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are measured at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired including identified intangibles is recorded as goodwill the determination and allocation of fair value to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on various assumptions and valuation methodologies requiring considerable management judgment including estimates based on historical information current market data and future expectations the company’s significant assumptions in these analyses include but are not limited to future cash flow projections with probability weighting applied when applicable the weighted average cost of capital the terminal growth rate and the tax rate for the income approach and metrics of publicly traded companies or historically completed transactions of comparable businesses for the market approach the company will also apply a weighting to the market approach and income approach to determine the fair value when applicable third party purchase offers may be utilized to measure fair value under the market approach although the estimates are deemed reasonable by management based on information available at the dates of acquisition those estimates are inherently uncertain 

assessment of the potential impairment of goodwill other intangible assets property plant and equipment investments in nonconsolidated affiliates and other assets is an integral part of the companys normal ongoing review of operations testing for potential impairment of these assets is significantly dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects managements best estimates at a particular point in time the dynamic economic environments in which the companys diversified product lines operate and key economic and product line assumptions with respect to projected selling prices market growth and inflation 

rates can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results changes in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments as well as the time in which such impairments are recognized in addition the company continually reviews its diverse portfolio of assets to ensure they are achieving their greatest potential and are aligned with the companys growth strategy strategic decisions involving a particular group of assets may trigger an assessment of the recoverability of the related assets such an assessment could result in impairment losses 

the company performs goodwill impairment testing at the reporting unit level which is defined as the operating segment or one level below the operating segment one level below the operating segment or component is a business in which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management the company aggregates certain components into reporting units based on economic similarities the company tests goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit has declined below its carrying value as of the date of the annual impairment test the company identified twelve reporting units of which seven have goodwill assigned two of those reporting units were reclassified as held for sale disposal groups as of the date of the annual impairment test of those two reporting units one has goodwill assigned and is presented in “assets held for sale” in the consolidated balance sheet the held for sale disposal groups are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell each reporting period the disposal group is reclassified as held for sale 

for purposes of goodwill impairment testing the company has the option to first perform qualitative testing to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value the qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors including reporting unit or asset specific operating results and cost factors as well as industry market and macroeconomic conditions to determine whether it is more likely than not more than 50 that the fair value of a reporting unit or asset is less than the respective carrying amount including goodwill if the company chooses not to complete a qualitative assessment for a given reporting unit or if the initial assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value additional quantitative testing is required 

if additional quantitative testing is performed an impairment loss is recognized in the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value limited to the amount of goodwill at the reporting unit the company determined fair values for each of the reporting units using a combination of the income approach and market approach 

under the income approach fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at an appropriate riskadjusted rate the company uses its internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and includes an estimate of longterm future growth rates based on its most recent views of the longterm outlook for each reporting unit the discounted cash flow valuations are completed using the following key assumptions projected revenue growth rates discount rates tax rates and terminal values the company applies probabilityweighted scenarios to the income approach to determine the concluded fair value of the reporting unit given the uncertainty in the current economic environment to determine the concluded fair value where applicable these key assumptions are determined through evaluation of the company as a whole and underlying business fundamentals and industry risk actual results may differ from those assumed in the company’s forecasts the company derives its discount rates using a capital asset pricing model and analyzing published rates for industries relevant to its reporting units to estimate the cost of equity financing the company uses discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective reporting units and in its internally developed forecasts discount rates used in the company’s reporting unit valuations ranged from 8 to 95 

under the market approach the company used the guideline public company method gpcm the selected peer sets were based on close competitors and reviews of analysts reports public filings and industry research related to firms operating in the respective reporting units industries in selecting the ebitebitda multiples and determining the fair value the company considered the size growth and profitability of each reporting unit versus the relevant guideline public companies 

estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described above could change in future periods 

2020 interim goodwill impairment testing 

during the third quarter of 2020 multiple triggering events occurred requiring the company to perform impairment analyses associated with its noncore segment as a result of the analyses performed the company recorded aggregate pretax noncash goodwill impairment charges of 183 million recognized in goodwill impairment charges in the consolidated statements of operations 

during the second quarter of 2020 continued nearterm demand weakness in global automotive production resulting from the covid19 pandemic along with revised views of recovery based on third party market information served as a triggering event requiring the company to perform an impairment analysis of the goodwill associated with its transportation  industrial reporting unit as a result of the analysis performed the company recorded pretax noncash goodwill impairment charges of 2498 million recognized in goodwill impairment charges in the consolidated statements of operations 

during the first quarter of 2020 the company was required to perform interim impairment tests of its goodwill and longlived assets as expectations of proceeds related to certain potential divestitures within the noncore segment gave rise to fair value indicators and thus served as triggering events as a result of the analysis performed the company recorded pretax noncash impairment charges related to goodwill of 533 million the charges were recognized in goodwill impairment charge in the consolidated statements of operations 

the company’s analyses above use a combination of the discounted cash flow models a form of the income approach utilizing level 3 unobservable inputs and the market approach the company’s significant assumptions in these analyses include but are not limited to future cash flow projections the weighted average cost of capital the terminal growth rate and the tax rate the company’s estimates of future cash flows are based on current regulatory and economic climates recent operating results and planned business strategies these estimates could be negatively affected by changes in federal state or local regulations or economic downturns future cash flow estimates are by their nature subjective and actual results may differ materially from the company’s estimates if the company’s ongoing estimates of future cash flows are not met the company may have to record additional impairment charges in future periods the company also uses the guideline public company method a form of the market approach utilizing level 3 unobservable inputs which is derived from metrics of publicly traded companies or historically completed transactions of comparable businesses the selection of comparable businesses is based on the markets in which the reporting units operate giving consideration to risk profiles size geography and diversity of products and services when applicable third party purchase offers may be utilized to measure fair value 

for further information see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

2020 annual goodwill impairment testing 

in the fourth quarter of 2020 the company performed its annual goodwill impairment testing by applying the qualitative assessment to four of its reporting units and the quantitative assessment to two of its reporting units for the reporting units tested under the qualitative assessment the company considered various qualitative factors that would have affected the estimated fair value of the reporting units and the results of the qualitative assessments indicated that it is not more likely than not that the fair values of the reporting units were less than their carrying values for the reporting units tested under the quantitative assessment the results indicated that the estimated fair values of the reporting units exceeded their carrying values 

the dynamic economic environments in which the companys diversified product lines operate and key economic and product line assumptions with respect to projected selling prices market growth and inflation rates can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results 

impairment and disposals of longlived assets 

the company evaluates the carrying value of longlived assets collectively the “asset group” to be held and used when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable such reviews are performed in accordance with asc 360 the carrying value of a longlived asset group is considered impaired when the anticipated future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset group over the remaining economic life of the asset group’s primary asset are separately identifiable and are less than its carrying value in that event a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the longlived asset group fair value of the asset group is determined using a combination of a discounted cash flow model andor market approach longlived assets to be disposed of by sale if material are classified as held for sale and reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell and depreciation is ceased longlived assets to be disposed of other than by sale are classified as held and used until they are disposed of and reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value depreciation is recognized over the remaining useful life of the assets 

longterm employee benefits 

the company has various obligations to its employees and retirees the company maintains retirementrelated programs in many countries that have a longterm impact on the companys earnings and cash flows these plans are typically defined benefit pension plans the company has a few medical dental and life insurance benefits for employees pensioners and survivors and for employees other postemployment benefits or opeb plans 

pension coverage for employees of the companys nonus consolidated subsidiaries is provided to the extent deemed appropriate through separate plans the company regularly explores alternative solutions to meet its global pension obligations in the most cost effective manner possible as demographics life expectancy and countryspecific pension funding rules change where permitted by applicable law the company reserves the right to change modify or discontinue its plans that provide pension medical dental and life insurance benefits under defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on years of service and employees pay near retirement 

pension benefits are paid primarily from trust funds established to comply with applicable laws and regulations of the sovereign country in which the pension plan operates unless required by law the company does not make contributions that are in excess of tax deductible limits the actuarial assumptions and procedures utilized are reviewed periodically by the plans actuaries to provide reasonable assurance that there will be adequate funds for the payment of benefits thus there is not necessarily a direct correlation between pension funding and pension expense in general however improvements in plans funded status tends to moderate subsequent funding needs 

the company contributed 28 million 497 million and 93 million to its funded pension plans for the years ended december 31 2020 december 31 2019 and december 31 2018 respectively 

the company does maintain one us pension benefit plan this plan is a separate unfunded plan and these benefits are paid to employees from operating cash flows the companys remaining pension plans with no plan assets are paid from operating cash flows the company made benefit payments of 70 million 71 million and 61 million to its unfunded plans for the years ended december 31 2020 december 31 2019 and december 31 2018 respectively 

the companys opeb plans are unfunded and the cost is paid from operating cash flows pretax cash requirements to cover payments for the companys opeb plans was 3 million for the year ended december 31 2020 and 1 million for the years ended december 31 2019 and december 31 2018 respectively 

in 2021 the company expects to contribute approximately 100 million to its funded pension plans and its remaining plans with no plan assets and about 6 million for its opeb plans the amount and timing of actual future contributions will depend on applicable funding requirements discount rates investment performance plan design and various other factors 

the companys income can be significantly affected by pension and defined contribution chargesbenefits as well as opeb costs the following table summarizes the extent to which the companys income for the years ended december 31 2020 december 31 2019 and december 31 2018 was affected by pretax charges related to longterm employee benefits 



the above charges benefit for pension and opeb are determined as of the beginning of each period see pension plans and other postemployment benefits under the critical accounting estimates section beginning on page 53 of this report for additional information on determining annual expense 

for 2021 long term employee benefit expense from continuing operations is expected to decrease by about 20 million the decrease is mainly due to lower interest cost and higher expected return on plan assets 

environmental matters 

the company operates global manufacturing product handling and distribution facilities that are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations such rules are subject to change by the implementing governmental agency and the company monitors these changes closely company policy requires that all operations fully meet or exceed legal and regulatory requirements in addition the company implements voluntary programs to reduce air emissions minimize the generation of hazardous waste decrease the volume of water use and discharges increase the efficiency of energy use and reduce the generation of persistent bioaccumulative and toxic materials management has noted a global upward trend in the amount and complexity of proposed chemicals regulation the costs to comply with complex environmental laws and regulations as well as internal voluntary programs and goals are significant and will continue to be significant for the foreseeable future the company has incurred environmental remediation costs of 6 million 28 million and 15 million for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

based on existing facts and circumstances management does not believe that yearoveryear changes if any in environmental expenses charged to current operations will have a material impact on the companys financial position liquidity or results of operations annual expenditures in the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures experienced in the past few years longer term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly 

environmental operating costs 

as a result of its operations the company incurs costs for pollution abatement activities including waste collection and disposal installation and maintenance of air pollution controls and wastewater treatment emissions testing and monitoring and obtaining permits the company also incurs costs related to environmental related research and development activities including environmental field and treatment studies as well as toxicity and degradation testing to evaluate the environmental impact of products and raw materials 

remediation accrual 

changes in the remediation accrual balance are summarized below 



1 represents the net change in indemnified remediation obligations based on activity pursuant to the dwdp separation and distribution agreement and letter agreement as discussed below and in notes 3 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements this is not inclusive of the accrual of 59 million related to eligible pfas costs associated with the mou 

considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs and under adverse changes in circumstances the potential liability may range up to 170 million above the amount accrued as of december 31 2020 however based on existing facts and circumstances management does not believe that any loss in excess of amounts accrued related to remediation activities at any individual site will have a material impact on the financial position liquidity or results of operations of the company 

pursuant to the dwdp separation and distribution agreement and the letter agreement discussed in notes 3 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements the company indemnifies dow and corteva for certain environmental matters the company has recorded an indemnification liability of 44 million corresponding to the companys accrual balance related to these matters at december 31 2020 the indemnification liability is included in the total remediation accrual liability of 80 million 

environmental capital expenditures 

capital expenditures for environmental projects either required by law or necessary to meet the company’s internal environmental goals were 43 million for the year ended december 31 2020 the company currently estimates expenditures for environmentalrelated capital projects to be approximately 48 million in 2021 

climate change 

the company believes that climate change is an important global issue that presents risks and opportunities for instance the company continuously evaluates opportunities for existing and new product and service offerings to meet the anticipated demands of a lowcarbon economy in 2019 the company announced nine new sustainability goals including an acting on climate goal to achieve a 30 percent reduction in absolute greenhouse gas ghg emissions by 2030 and carbon neutral operations by 2050 dupont reports on its progress against these goals in its annual sustainability report 

the company is actively engaged in efforts to develop constructive public policies to reduce ghg emissions and encourage lowercarbon forms of energy such policies may bring higher operating costs as well as greater revenue and margin opportunities legislative efforts to control or limit ghg emissions could affect the companys energy source and supply choices as well as increase the cost of energy and raw materials derived from fossil fuels such efforts are also anticipated to provide the business community with greater certainty for the regulatory future help guide investment decisions and drive growth in demand for lowcarbon and energyefficient products technologies and services similarly demand is expected to grow for products that facilitate adaptation to a changing climate however the current unsettled policy environment in the us where many company facilities are located adds an element of uncertainty to business decisions particularly those relating to longterm capital investments 

in addition significant differences in regional or national approaches could present challenges in a global marketplace an effective global climate policy framework will help drive the market changes that are needed to stimulate and efficiently deploy new innovations in science and technology while maintaining open and competitive global markets 

sustainability 

in october 2019 dupont announced its fifthgeneration sustainability strategy — nine ambitious priorities that reflect the companys best opportunity to make a positive impact in the world while advancing our business objectives the tenyear strategy prioritizes global challenges such as climate change water stewardship advancing circular economy and processes improving health and safety and more with these goals dupont committed to using the companys strength in innovation to advance progress on several of the united nations’ sustainable development goals sdgs increasing resiliency and reducing environmental and social impacts across value chains and ensuring people are put at the center of all our work 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company’s global operations are exposed to financial market risks relating to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates the company has established a variety of programs including the use of derivative instruments and other financial instruments to manage the exposure to financial market risks as to minimize volatility of financial results in the ordinary course of business the company enters into derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign currency interest rate and commodity price risks under established procedures and controls for additional information on these derivatives and related exposures see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements decisions regarding whether or not to hedge a given commitment are made on a casebycase basis taking into consideration the amount and duration of the exposure market volatility and economic trends foreign currency exchange contracts are also used from time to time to manage nearterm foreign currency cash requirements 

foreign currency exchange rate risks 

the company has significant international operations resulting in a large number of currency transactions that result from international sales purchases investments and borrowings the primary currencies for which the company has an exchange rate exposure are the european euro eur chinese renminbi and japanese yen the company uses forward exchange contracts to offset its net exposures by currency related to the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities of its operations in addition to the contracts disclosed in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements from time to time the company will enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to establish with certainty the us dollar usd amount of future firm commitments denominated in a foreign currency 

the following table illustrates the fair values of outstanding foreign currency contracts at december 31 2020 and the effect on fair values of a hypothetical adverse change in the foreign exchange rates that existed at december 31 2020 the sensitivities for foreign currency contracts are based on a 10 percent adverse change in foreign exchange rates 



since the companys risk management programs are highly effective the potential loss in value for each risk management portfolio described above would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure 

concentration of credit risk

significant customers and competition 

in 2019 no significant portion of the companys sales was dependent upon a single customer the markets in which the company participates compete primarily through technology range of products and services performance quality reliability brand reputation service and support the company provides extensive support technical services and testing services for its customers in addition to new product development the company believes that its proprietary product and process technologies robust product and application development pipelines customer intimacy global manufacturing capability and local service capability enable it to compete successfully 

against this competitive backdrop valueinuse is the primary driver of price for the company’s products although price is impacted by many factors including among others fluctuations in supply and demand and availability and cost of key manufacturing inputs including raw materials and energy 

  

distribution 

most products are marketed primarily through the companys sales organization although in some regions more emphasis is placed on sales through distributors the company has a diverse worldwide network which markets and distributes the companys brands to customers globally this network consists of the companys sales and marketing organization partnering with distributors independent retailers cooperatives and agents throughout the world 

backlog 

in general the company does not manufacture its products against a backlog of orders and does not consider backlog to be a significant indicator of the level of future sales activity production and inventory levels are based on the level of incoming orders as well as projections of future demand therefore the company believes that backlog information is not meaningful to understanding its overall business and should not be considered a reliable indicator of the companys ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance 

intellectual property 

trade secrets trade secrets are an important part of the companys intellectual property many of the processes used to make products are kept as trade secrets which from time to time may be licensed to third parties dupont vigilantly protects all of its intellectual property including its trade secrets when the company discovers that its trade secrets have been unlawfully taken it reports the matter to governmental authorities for investigation and potential criminal action as appropriate in addition the company takes measures to mitigate any potential impact which may include civil actions seeking redress restitution andor damages based on loss to the company andor unjust enrichment 

patents the company continually applies for and obtains patents in many countries including the us and has access to a large patent portfolio both owned and licensed dupont’s rights under these patents and licenses as well as the products made and sold under them are important to the company in the aggregate the protection afforded by these patents varies based on country scope of individual patent coverage as well as the availability of legal remedies in each country the term of these patents is generally about twenty years but varies depending on country this significant patent estate may be leveraged to align with the company’s strategic priorities within and across product lines at december 31 2019 the company owned more than 27000 patents and patent applications globally approximately 80 of the company’s patent estate has a remaining term of more than 5 years 

trademarks the company owns or licenses many trademarks that have significant recognition at the consumer retail level andor has a product line to product line level ownership rights in trademarks do not expire if the trademarks are continued in use and properly protected 

dowdupont intellectual property agreements in connection with the separation and distribution of dow and corteva effective april 1 2019 and june 1 2019 respectively the company entered into intellectual property license agreements related to fields of use within the scope of the respective businesses together the “ip license agreements” the ip license agreements set forth the terms and conditions under which the applicable parties may use in their respective businesses certain knowhow including trade secrets copyrights trademarks and software and certain patents and standards allocated to another party pursuant to the dowdupont separation and distribution agreement

 item 1a risk factors 

the companys operations could be affected by various risks many of which are beyond its control based on current information the company believes that the following identifies the most significant risk factors that could affect its operations past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 

risks relating to the proposed nb transaction and the dow and corteva distributions 

dupont is pursuing a plan to separate and combine its nutrition  biosciences business with iff in a reverse morris trust transaction this proposed transaction involves risks including risks that the proposed transaction may not be completed on the currently contemplated timeline or at all and may not achieve the intended benefits 

on december 15 2019 dupont and iff announced they had entered definitive agreements to combine dupont’s nutrition  biosciences business the nb business with iff in a transaction that would result in iff issuing shares to dupont shareholders the proposed transaction with iff the proposed nb transaction is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2021 subject to approval by iff stockholders and other customary closing conditions including regulatory approvals and receipt by dupont of an opinion of tax counsel a voting agreement was entered on december 15 2019 with winder investment pte ltd a shareholder of iff pursuant to the voting agreement winder agrees among other things to vote in favor of the issuance of iff common stock in connection with the nb transaction and any proposal or action presented to effectuate the issuance the voting agreement terminates on september 30 2020 the satisfaction of the required conditions could delay the consummation of the proposed transaction with iff or prevent it from occurring further there can be no assurance that the conditions to the closing of the proposed transaction will be satisfied or waived or that the proposed transaction will be consummated with respect to regulatory approvals there can be no assurance that the required regulatory approvals will be received in a timely manner or at all or that such approvals will not contain adverse conditions failure to consummate the proposed transaction in a timely manner or at all could negatively impact the market price of dupont’s common stock as well as dupont’s future business and its financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the announcement and pendency of the proposed nb transaction could cause disruptions in dupont’s and iff’s respective businesses including potential adverse reactions or changes to business relationships and competitive responses to the transaction the transaction will also require significant amounts of time and effort which could divert management’s attention from operating and growing our business dupont has incurred and expects to incur a number of nonrecurring costs in connection with the proposed nb transaction these costs and expenses include financial legal accounting consulting and other advisory fees and expenses reorganization and restructuring costs severanceemployee benefitrelated expenses regulatory and sec filing fees and expenses printing expenses and other related charges some of which are payable by dupont regardless of whether the proposed transaction is consummated the merger agreement with iff also generally requires dupont to operate the nb business in the ordinary course pending consummation of the mergers and restricts dupont without iff’s consent from taking certain specified actions until the proposed transaction is consummated or the merger agreement is terminated including making certain acquisitions and divestitures and entering into certain contracts any of the foregoing could adversely affect dupont’s business financial condition and results of operations declines in sales earnings and cash flows could also result in future asset impairments including goodwill 

even if the proposed transaction is completed there can be no assurance that dupont will be able to realize the anticipated value and benefits therefrom or that the new combined company will perform as expected further if the proposed transaction is completed the combined value of the dupont common stock and the shares of iff common stock issued as consideration in the nb merger could be greater than less than or equal to what the value of dupont’s common stock would have been had the proposed transaction not occurred 

in connection with the proposed transaction with iff nb inc entered into a bridge commitment letter to secure from certain financing sources committed financing in an aggregate principal amount of 75 billion the “bridge loans” provided that such commitment shall be reduced by among other things 1 the amount of net cash proceeds received by nb inc from any issuance of senior unsecured notes pursuant to a rule 144a offering or other private placement the nb notes offering and 2 certain qualifying term loan commitments under senior unsecured term loan facilities the proceeds of funded bridge loans if any would be used by nb inc to make the special cash payment and to pay the related transaction fees and expenses 

in january 2020 nb inc entered into a senior unsecured term loan agreement in the amount of 125 billion split evenly between three and fiveyear facilities the proceeds of which shall be used to make the special cash payment and to pay the related transaction fees and expenses such term loan facility reduced the commitments under the bridge commitment letter the remaining 625 billion is expected to be funded through the nb notes offering if any andor the bridge loans the commitments under the bridge commitment letter and the availability of funding under the term loan are subject to customary closing conditions 

borrowing under the term loan facility and if any under the bridge loans would occur substantially concurrently with closing of the transaction any issuance of senior unsecured notes pursuant to a rule 144a offering or other private placement for some or all the remaining 625 billion would likely occur in advance of the closing if such issuance occurred prior to the closing during the period between the offering and the closing of the proposed nb transaction the debt of dupont on a consolidated basis would be materially increased such increase if any is not expected to adversely impact dupont’s results of operations financial position or access to liquidity if any notes are issued prior to closing and the proposed transaction with iff is subsequently terminated dupont expects that nb inc would immediately repay any such debt 

the separation and combination of dupont’s nutrition  biosciences business with iff could result in significant tax liability to dupont 

following the nb merger with nb inc as the surviving company except as agreed by the parties nb inc will merge with and into neptune merger sub ii llc a wholly owned subsidiary of iff “merger sub ii” with merger sub ii surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of iff the “second merger” and together with the nb merger the “mergers” 

the nb distribution and mergers are expected to be taxfree to dupont stockholders for us federal income tax purposes except to the extent that cash is paid to dupont stockholders in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to the merger agreement and the contribution nb distribution and special cash payment are expected to result in no recognition of gain or loss by dupont for us federal income tax purposes 

the proposed transaction with iff is conditioned on duponts receipt of an opinion from skadden arps slate meagher  flom llp regarding i the qualification of the contribution nb distribution and special cash payment as a “reorganization” within the meaning of sections 368a 361 and 355 of the internal revenue code of 1986 the “code” ii the nonrecognition of gain or loss by dupont on receipt of the special cash payment subject to certain conditions iii the qualification of the nb distribution as a distribution described in section 355 and to which section 355e does not apply and iv the qualification of the mergers as a “reorganization” within the meaning of section 368a of the code this opinion will be based upon and rely on among other things certain facts and assumptions as well as certain representations statements and undertakings of dupont nb inc iff and merger sub 1 and merger sub ii if any of these representations statements or undertakings are or become inaccurate or incomplete or if any party breaches any of its covenants in the relevant transaction documents the opinion may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized notwithstanding the receipt of such opinion the internal revenue service the “irs” could determine that the separation of dupont’s nutrition  biosciences business should be treated as a taxable transaction if it determines that any of the facts assumptions representations statements or undertakings upon which the opinion of counsel was based are false or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion an opinion of counsel is not binding on the irs and there can be no assurance that the irs will not assert a contrary position 

if the contribution nb distribution and special cash payment failed to qualify for the treatment described above dupont would be required to generally recognize taxable gain on the transactions and stockholders of dupont who receive nb inc common stock and subsequently iff common stock pursuant to a prorata dividend distribution or an exchange offer would be subject to tax on their receipt of the nb inc common stock additionally if certain internal transactions related to the separation of the nutrition  biosciences business fail to qualify for their intended taxfree treatment under us federal state local tax andor foreign tax law dupont could incur additional tax liabilities 

under the tax matters agreement to be entered into by dupont with nb inc and iff nb inc or iff would generally be required to indemnify dupont for any taxes resulting from the separation of the nutrition  biosciences business and any related costs and other damages to the extent such amounts resulted from i certain actions taken by nb inc or iff involving the capital stock of nb inc or iff or any assets of the nb inc group excluding actions required by the documents governing the proposed transactions or ii any breach of certain representations and covenants made by nb inc or iff 

dupont is subject to continuing contingent taxrelated liabilities of dow and corteva following the separations and distributions 

after the separations and distributions there are several significant areas where the liabilities of dow and corteva may become the company’s obligations either in whole or in part for example to the extent that any subsidiary of the company was included in the consolidated tax reporting group of either historical dow or historical eid for any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the effective date of the merger such subsidiary is jointly and severally liable for the us federal income tax liability of the entire consolidated tax reporting group of historical dow or historical eid as applicable for such taxable period in connection with the separations and distributions dupont dow and corteva have entered into a tax matters agreement as amended that allocates the responsibility for prior period consolidated taxes among dow corteva and dupont if dow or corteva are unable to pay any prior period taxes for which it is responsible however dupont could be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes and such amounts could be significant other provisions of federal state local or foreign law 

may establish similar liability for other matters including laws governing taxqualified pension plans as well as other contingent liabilities 

in connection with the separations and distributions certain liabilities are allocated to or retained by dupont through assumption or indemnification of dow andor corteva as applicable if dupont is required to make payments pursuant to these indemnities to dow andor corteva dupont may need to divert cash to meet those obligations and the company’s financial results could be negatively impacted in addition certain liabilities are allocated to or retained by dow andor corteva through assumption or indemnification or subject to indemnification by other third parties these indemnities may not be sufficient to insure the company against the full amount of liabilities including pfas stray liabilities allocated to or retained by it and dow corteva andor third parties may not be able to satisfy their respective indemnification obligations in the future 

pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement the employee matters agreement and the tax matters agreement as amended collectively the “core agreements” with dow and corteva as well as the letter agreement between dupont and corteva dupont has agreed to assume and indemnify dow and corteva for certain liabilities see discussion of the core agreements in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements and litigation and environmental matters in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements payments pursuant to these indemnities may be significant and could negatively impact the company’s business particularly indemnities relating to the company’s actions that could impact the taxfree nature of the distributions third parties could also seek to hold it responsible for any of the liabilities allocated to dow and corteva including those related to historical eid’s materials science andor agriculture businesses or for the conduct of such businesses prior to the distributions and such third parties could seek damages other monetary penalties whether civil or criminal andor other remedies additionally dupont generally assumes and is responsible for the payment of the company’s share of i certain liabilities of dowdupont relating to arising out of or resulting from certain general corporate matters of dupont and ii certain separation expenses not otherwise allocated to corteva or dow or allocated specifically to it pursuant to the core agreements and third parties could seek to hold it responsible for dow’s or corteva’s share of any such liabilities dow andor corteva as applicable have agreed to indemnify it for such liabilities however such indemnities may not be sufficient to protect it against the full amount of such liabilities or from other remedies and dow andor corteva as applicable may not be able to fully satisfy their indemnification obligations even if dupont ultimately succeeds in recovering from dow andor corteva as applicable any amounts for which dupont are held liable dupont may be temporarily required to bear these losses each of these risks could negatively affect the company’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

generally as described in litigation and environmental matters losses related from liabilities related to discontinued andor divested operations and businesses of historical eid that are not primarily related to its agriculture business or specialty products business “stray liabilities” are allocated to or shared by each of corteva and dupont stray liabilities include liabilities arising out of actions to the extent related to or resulting from historical eid’s development testing manufacture or sale of per or polyfluoroalkyl substances “pfas stray liabilities” in connection with historical eid’s separation of its performance chemicals segment through the spinoff of the chemours company “chemours” chemours indemnifies certain pfas stray liabilities as well as other litigation environmental and other liabilities that arose prior to the chemours separation 

certain stray liabilities are subject to third party indemnities including certain pfas stray liabilities as discussed above and further described in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements however such indemnities may not be sufficient to protect the company against the full amount of such liabilities or such third parties may refuse or otherwise claim defenses to payment for example as described in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements on may 13 2019 chemours filed suit in the delaware court of chancery against historical eid corteva and the company in an attempt to limit its responsibility for the litigation and environmental liabilities allocated to and assumed by chemours under the chemours separation agreement 

although the company believes it is remote there can be no assurance that any such third party would have adequate resources to satisfy its indemnification obligation when due or would not ultimately be successful in claiming defenses against payment even if recovery from the third party is ultimately successful dupont may be temporarily required to bear these losses each of these risks could negatively affect the company’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if the completed distribution of corteva or dow in each case together with certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for nonrecognition treatment for us federal income tax purposes then the company could be subject to significant tax and indemnification liability 

the completed distributions of corteva and dow were each conditioned upon the receipt of an opinion from skadden arps slate meagher  flom llp the company’s tax counsel regarding the qualification of the applicable distribution along with certain related transactions as a taxfree transaction under section 355 and section 368a1d of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” and such opinions collectively the “tax opinions” the tax opinions relied on certain facts assumptions and undertakings and certain representations from the company dow and corteva as applicable as well as the irs ruling as defined below notwithstanding the tax opinions and the irs ruling the internal revenue service the “irs” could determine 

on audit that either or both of the distributions and certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or that the distributions should be taxable for other reasons including if the irs were to disagree with the conclusions of the tax opinions 

even if a distribution otherwise constituted a taxfree transaction to stockholders under section 355 of the code the company could be required to recognize corporate level tax on such distribution and certain related transactions under section 355e of the code if the irs determines that as a result of the merger or other transactions considered part of a plan with such distribution there was a 50 percent or greater change in ownership in the company dow or corteva as relevant in connection with the merger the company sought and received a private letter ruling from the irs regarding the proper time manner and methodology for measuring common ownership in the stock of the company historical eid and historical dow for purposes of determining whether there was a 50 percent or greater change of ownership under section 355e of the code as a result of the merger the “irs ruling” the tax opinions relied on the continued validity of the irs ruling and representations made by the company as to the common ownership of the stock of historical dow and historical eid immediately prior to the merger and concluded that there was not a 50 percent or greater change of ownership for purposes of section 355e as a result of the merger notwithstanding the tax opinions and the irs ruling the irs could determine that a distribution or a related transaction should nevertheless be treated as a taxable transaction to the company if it determines that any of the company’s facts assumptions representations or undertakings was not correct or that a distribution should be taxable for other reasons including if the irs were to disagree with the conclusions in the tax opinions that are not covered by the irs ruling 

  

generally corporate taxes resulting from the failure of a distribution to qualify for nonrecognition treatment for us federal income tax purposes would be imposed on the company under the tax matters agreement as amended that the company entered into with dow and corteva dow and corteva are generally obligated to indemnify the company against any such taxes imposed on it however if a distribution fails to qualify for nonrecognition treatment for us federal income tax purposes for certain reasons relating to the overall structure of the merger and the distributions then under the tax matters agreement as amended the company and corteva on the one hand and dow on the other hand would share the tax liability resulting from such failure in accordance with the relative equity values of the company and dow on the first full trading day following the distribution of dow and the company and corteva would in turn share any such resulting tax liability in accordance with the relative equity values of the company and corteva on the first full trading day following the distribution of corteva furthermore under the terms of the tax matters agreement as amended a party also generally will be responsible for any taxes imposed on the other parties that arise from the failure of either distribution to qualify as taxfree for us federal income tax purposes within the meaning of section 355 of the code or the failure of certain related transactions to qualify for taxfree treatment to the extent such failure to qualify is attributable to actions events or transactions relating to such party or such partys affiliates’ stock assets or business or any breach of such partys representations made in connection with the irs ruling or in any representation letter provided to a tax advisor in connection with certain tax opinions including the tax opinions regarding the taxfree status of the distributions and certain related transactions to the extent that the company is responsible for any liability under the tax matters agreement as amended there could be a material adverse impact on the companys business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in future reporting periods 

the separations and distributions may expose the company to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal distribution requirements 

although dupont received a solvency opinion from an investment bank confirming that dupont dow and corteva would each be adequately capitalized following the separations and distributions the separations and distributions could be challenged under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws fraudulent conveyances or transfers are generally defined to include transfers made or obligations incurred with the actual intent to hinder delay or defraud current or future creditors or transfers made or obligations incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value when the debtor was insolvent or that rendered the debtor insolvent inadequately capitalized or unable to pay its debts as they become due any unpaid creditor could claim that dupont did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value in the separations and distributions and that the separations and distributions left dupont insolvent or with unreasonably small capital or that dupont intended or believed dupont would incur debts beyond the company’s ability to pay such debts as they mature if a court were to agree with such a plaintiff then such court could void the separations and distributions as a fraudulent transfer or impose substantial liabilities on it which could adversely affect the company’s financial condition and the company’s results of operations 

the separations and distributions are also subject to review under state corporate distribution statutes under the delaware general corporation law a corporation may only pay dividends to its stockholders either i out of its surplus net assets minus capital or ii if there is no such surplus out of its net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared andor the preceding fiscal year although dupont’s board of directors made the distributions out of dupont’s surplus and received an opinion that dupont had adequate surplus under delaware law to declare the dividends of corteva and dow common stock in connection with the distributions there can be no assurance that a court will not later determine that some or all of the distributions were unlawful 

risks relating to dupont’s business 

changes in the company’s credit ratings could increase the company’s cost of borrowing or restrict the company’s ability to access debt capital markets the company’s credit ratings are important to the company’s cost of capital 

dupont relies on access to the debt capital markets and other shortterm borrowings to finance the company’s longterm and daytoday operations a decrease in the ratings assigned to it by the ratings agencies may negatively impact the company’s access to the debt capital markets and increase the company’s cost of borrowing the major rating agencies will routinely evaluate the company’s credit profile and assign debt ratings to it this evaluation is based on a number of factors which include weighing the company’s financial strength versus business industry and financial risk the addition of further leverage to the company’s capital structure could impact the company’s credit ratings failure to maintain an investment grade rating at the company’s current level would adversely affect the company’s cost of funding and the company’s results of operations and could adversely affect the company’s liquidity and access to the capital markets any limitation on the company’s ability to continue to raise money in the debt capital markets could have a substantial negative effect on the company’s liquidity if dupont is unable to generate sufficient cash flow or maintain access to adequate external financing including from significant disruptions in the global credit markets it could restrict the company’s current operations activities under its current and future stock buyback programs and the company’s growth opportunities which could adversely affect the company’s operating results 

  

a significant percentage of the company’s net sales are generated from the company’s international operations and are subject to economic political regulatory foreign exchange and other risks 

the percentage of net sales generated by the international operations of dupont including us exports was approximately 70 percent of net sales on a continuing operations basis for the year ended december 31 2019 with asia pacific as the company’s largest region dupont expects the percentage of the company’s net sales derived from international operations to continue to be significant risks related to international operations include 

 

these and other factors can impair the company’s flexibility in modifying product marketing pricing or other strategies for growing the company’s businesses as well as the company’s ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins 

the company’s international operations expose it to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar which could adversely affect the company’s results of operations for its continuing operations as of the year ended december 31 2019 the company’s largest currency exposures are the chinese renminbi and the taiwan dollar us dollar fluctuations against foreign currency have an impact to commercial prices and raw material costs in some cases and could result in local price increases if the price or raw material costs is denominated in us dollar 

sales and expenses of the company’s nonus businesses are also translated into us dollars for reporting purposes and fluctuations of foreign currency against the us dollar could impact us dollardenominated earnings in addition the company’s assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies can also be impacted by foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar which could result in exchange gain or loss from revaluation 

dupont also faces exchange rate risk from the company’s investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries 

dupont has a balance sheet hedging program and actively looks for opportunities in managing currency exposures related to earnings however foreign exchange hedging activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to it or be successful in completely mitigating such exposures 

dupont generates significant amounts of cash outside of the united states that is invested with financial and nonfinancial counterparties while dupont employs comprehensive controls regarding global cash management to guard against cash or investment loss and to ensure the company’s ability to fund the company’s operations and commitments a material disruption to the counterparties with whom dupont transacts business could expose it to financial loss 

any one or more of the above factors could adversely affect the company’s international operations and could significantly affect the company’s business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

volatility in energy and raw material costs could have a significant impact on the company’s sales and earnings 

the company’s manufacturing processes consume significant amounts of energy and raw materials the costs of which are subject to worldwide supply and demand as well as other factors beyond the company’s control significant variations in the cost of energy which primarily reflect market prices for oil natural gas and raw materials affect the company’s operating results from period to period legislation to address climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions creating a carbon tax or implementing a cap and trade program could create increases in energy costs and price volatility 

when possible dupont purchases raw materials through negotiated longterm contracts to minimize the impact of price fluctuations additionally dupont uses overthecounter and exchange traded derivative commodity instruments to hedge the company’s exposure to price fluctuations on certain raw material purchases including food ingredients dupont also takes actions to offset the effects of higher energy and raw material costs through selling price increases productivity improvements and cost reduction programs success in offsetting higher raw material costs with price increases is largely influenced by competitive and economic conditions and could vary significantly depending on the market served as a result volatility in these costs may negatively impact the company’s business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the company’s results will be affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences 

demand for the company’s products which impacts revenue and profit margins will be affected by i the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products ii the company’s response to downward pricing trends to stay competitive iii changes in customer order patterns such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes changes in the company’s incentive programs or the customer’s ability to achieve incentive goals iv the impact of tariffs or trade disputes on availability of raw materials and v changes in customers’ preferences for the company’s products including the success of products offered by the company’s competitors and changes in customer’s designs for their products that can affect the demand for some of the company’s products 

additionally success in achieving the company’s growth objectives is significantly dependent on the timing and market acceptance of the company’s new product offerings including the company’s ability to renew the company’s pipeline of new product offerings and to bring those offerings to market this ability may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development such as the inability to identify viable new products obtain adequate intellectual property protection or gain market acceptance of new products there are no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful the company’s success will depend on several factors including the company’s ability to 

 

there are no guarantees that new product offerings will prove to be commercially successful   additionally the company’s expansion into new markets may result in greaterthanexpected risks liabilities and expenses 

the costs of complying with evolving regulatory requirements could negatively impact the company’s business results of operations financial condition and cash flows actual or alleged violations of environmental laws or permit requirements could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations and substantial civil or criminal sanctions as well as the assessment of strict liability andor joint and several liability 

dupont continues to be subject to extensive federal state local and foreign laws regulations rules and ordinances relating to pollution protection of the environment greenhouse gas emissions and the generation storage handling transportation treatment disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials costs and capital expenditures relating to environmental health or safety matters are subject to evolving regulatory requirements and depend on the timing of the promulgation and enforcement of specific standards which impose the requirements moreover changes in environmental regulations could inhibit or interrupt the company’s operations or require modifications to the company’s facilities changes to regulations or the implementation of additional regulations especially in certain highly regulated markets served by the company’s nutrition  biosciences businesses such as regulatory modernization of food safety laws and evolving standards and regulations affecting pharmaceutical excipients microbials or in reaction to new or nextgeneration technologies including advances in protein engineering gene editing and gene mapping or novel uses of existing technologies may result in significant costs or capital expenditures or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced margins or profitability 

accordingly environmental health or safety regulatory matters could result in significant unanticipated costs or liabilities causing a negative impact on the company’s business cash flows and results of operations 

the company’s business results of operations and reputation could be adversely affected by industryspecific risks including process safety and product stewardshipregulatory compliance issues 

dupont is subject to risks which include but are not limited to product safety or quality shifting consumer preferences federal state and local regulations on manufacturing or labeling environmental health and safety regulations and customer product liability claims while dupont maintains general liability insurance the amount of liability that may result from certain of these risks may not always be covered by or could exceed the applicable insurance coverage in addition negative publicity related to product liability food safety safety health and environmental matters may damage the company’s reputation the occurrence of any of the matters described above could adversely affect the company’s business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in most jurisdictions dupont must test the safety efficacy and environmental impact of the company’s products to satisfy regulatory requirements and obtain the needed approvals in certain jurisdictions dupont must periodically renew the company’s approvals which may require it to demonstrate compliance with thencurrent standards the regulatory approvals process is lengthy complex and in some markets unpredictable with requirements that can vary by product technology industry and country additionally the regulatory environment may be impacted by the activities of nongovernmental organizations and special interest groups and stakeholder reactions to the actual or perceived impacts of new technology products or processes on safety health and the environment obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals will require submitting a significant amount of information and data which may require participation from technology providers regulatory standards and trial procedures are continuously changing the pace of change together with the lack of regulatory harmony could result in unintended noncompliance to maintain the company’s right to produce or sell existing products or to commercialize new products dupont must be able to demonstrate the company’s ability to satisfy the requirements of regulatory agencies 

the failure to meet existing and new requirements or receive necessary permits or approvals could have near and longterm effects on the company’s ability to produce and sell certain current and future products which could significantly increase operating costs and adversely affect the company’s business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the company’s business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected by interruption of the company’s supply chain information technology or network systems and other business disruptions 

supply chain disruptions plant andor power outages labor disputes andor strikes information technology system andor network disruptions whether caused by acts of sabotage employee error malfeasance or other actions geopolitical activity weather events and natural disasters including hurricanes or flooding that impact coastal regions and global health risks or pandemics could seriously harm the company’s operations as well as the operations of the company’s customers and suppliers in addition terrorist attacks and natural disasters have increased stakeholder concerns about the security and safety of chemical production and distribution 

supply chain and other business disruptions may also be caused by security breaches which could include for example attacks on information technology and infrastructure by hackers viruses breaches due to employee error malfeasance or other actions or other disruptions dupont andor the company’s suppliers may fail to effectively prevent detect and recover from these or other security breaches and therefore such breaches could result in misuse of the company’s assets loss of property including trade secrets and confidential or personal information some of which is subject to privacy and security laws and other business 

disruptions as a result dupont may be subject to legal claims or proceedings reporting errors processing inefficiencies negative media attention loss of sales interference with regulatory compliance which could result in sanctions or penalties liability or penalties under privacy laws disruption in the company’s operations and damage to the company’s reputation which could adversely affect the company’s business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

like most major corporations dupont is the target of industrial espionage including cyberattacks from time to time dupont has determined that these attacks have resulted and could result in the future in unauthorized parties gaining access to certain confidential business information although management does not believe that dupont has experienced any material losses to date related to these security breaches including cybersecurity incidents there can be no assurance that dupont will not suffer such losses in the future 

dupont seeks to actively manage the risks within the company’s control that could lead to business disruptions and security breaches as these threats continue to evolve particularly around cybersecurity dupont may be required to expend significant resources to enhance the company’s control environment processes practices and other protective measures despite these efforts such events could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

enforcing the company’s intellectual property rights or defending against intellectual property claims asserted by others could adversely affect the company’s business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

intellectual property rights including patents trade secrets knowhow and other confidential information trademarks tradenames and other forms of trade dress are important to the company’s business dupont endeavors to protect the company’s intellectual property rights in jurisdictions in which the company’s products are produced or used and in jurisdictions into which the company’s products are imported however dupont may be unable to obtain protection for the company’s intellectual property in key jurisdictions further changes in government policies and regulations including changes made in reaction to pressure from nongovernmental organizations or the public generally could impact the extent of intellectual property protection afforded by such jurisdictions 

dupont has designed and implemented internal controls intended to restrict access to and distribution of the company’s intellectual property despite these precautions the company’s intellectual property is vulnerable to unauthorized access through employee error or actions theft and cybersecurity incidents and other security breaches when unauthorized access and use or counterfeit products are discovered dupont considers the matter for report to governmental authorities for investigation as appropriate and take measures to mitigate any potential impact protecting intellectual property related to biotechnology is particularly challenging because theft is difficult to detect and biotechnology can be selfreplicating accordingly the impact of such theft can be significant 

competitors are increasingly challenging the company’s intellectual property positions and the potential outcomes can be highly uncertain third parties may also claim the company’s products violate their intellectual property rights defending such claims even those without merit is timeconsuming and expensive in addition as a result of such claims dupont has and could be required in the future to enter into license agreements develop noninfringing products or engage in litigation that could be costly if challenges are resolved adversely it could negatively impact the company’s ability to obtain licenses on competitive terms commercialize new products and generate sales from existing products 

in addition because of the rapid pace of technological change the confidentiality of patent applications in some jurisdictions andor the uncertainty in predicting the outcome of complex proceedings relating to ownership or the scope of protection of patents relating to certain emerging technologies competitors may be unexpectedly issued patents that dupont does not anticipate these patents could reduce the value of the company’s commercial or pipeline products or to the extent they cover key technologies on which dupont has unknowingly relied require it to seek to obtain licenses or cease using the technology no matter how valuable to the company’s business if dupont decided to obtain licenses to continue using the technology it cannot ensure dupont would be able to obtain such a license on acceptable terms 

legislation and jurisprudence on patent protection is evolving and changes in laws could affect the company’s ability to obtain or maintain patent protection for the company’s products 

any one or more of the above factors could significantly affect the company’s business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

increased concerns regarding chemicals in commerce and their potential impact on the environment have resulted in more restrictive regulations may lead to new regulations and compliance may be costly 

concerns about chemicals and biotechnology as well as their potential impact on health and the environment reflect a growing trend in societal demands for increasing levels of product safety and environmental protection these concerns could manifest themselves in stockholder proposals preferred purchasing delays or failures in obtaining or retaining regulatory approvals delayed product launches lack of market acceptance product discontinuation continued pressure for and adoption of more stringent regulatory intervention and litigation these concerns could also influence public perceptions the viability or continued sales of certain of the company’s products the company’s reputation and the cost to comply with regulations and as a result could have a negative impact on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets could negatively impact the company’s financial results 

at least annually dupont must assess both goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment intangible assets with finite lives are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable if testing indicates that goodwill or intangible assets are impaired their carrying values will be written down based on fair values with a charge against earnings where dupont utilizes discounted cash flow methodologies in determining fair values continued weak demand for a specific product line or business could result in an impairment accordingly any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of goodwill or intangible assets could negatively impact the company’s results of operations 

as a result of the merger and related acquisition method of accounting historical eid’s assets and liabilities were measured at fair value and any declines in projected cash flows could have a material negative impact on the fair value of the company’s reporting units and assets future impairments of the company’s goodwill or intangible assets also could be recorded due to changes in assumptions estimates or circumstances and the magnitude of such impairments may be material to it 

failure to effectively manage acquisitions divestitures alliances and other portfolio actions could adversely impact the company’s business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

dupont from time to time evaluates acquisition candidates that may strategically fit the company’s business andor growth objectives if dupont is unable to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses dupont could fail to achieve anticipated synergies and cost savings including any expected increases in revenues and operating results which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results dupont expects to continually review the company’s portfolio of assets for contributions to the company’s objectives and alignment with the company’s growth strategy the letter agreement between the company and corteva limits dupont’s ability to separate certain businesses and assets to third parties without assigning certain of its indemnification obligations under the separation and distribution agreement to the transferee of such businesses and assets or meeting certain other alternative conditions dupont may be unable to meet the conditions under the letter agreement if applicable even if the conditions under the letter agreement are met or are not applicable dupont may not be successful in separating underperforming or nonstrategic assets and gains or losses on the divestiture of or lost operating income from such assets may affect the company’s earnings moreover dupont might incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures that reduce the company’s earnings in addition if the execution or implementation of acquisitions divestitures alliances joint ventures and other portfolio actions is not successful andor the company fails to effectively manage its cost as its portfolio evolves it could adversely impact the company’s business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the company’s results of operations could be adversely affected by litigation and other commitments and contingencies 

dupont faces risks arising from various unasserted and asserted litigation matters including product liability patent infringement and other intellectual property disputes contract and commercial litigation claims for damage or personal injury antitrust claims governmental regulations and other actions an adverse outcome in any one or more of these matters could be material to the company’s business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in the ordinary course of business dupont may make certain commitments including representations warranties and indemnities relating to current and past operations including those related to divested businesses and dupont may issue guarantees of thirdparty obligations if dupont is required to make payments as a result they could exceed the amounts accrued therefor thereby adversely affecting the company’s results of operations 

dupont is subject to numerous laws regulations and mandates globally which could adversely affect the company’s operating results and forward strategy 

dupont does business globally in more than 60 countries dupont is required to comply with the numerous and farreaching laws and regulations administered by united states federal state local and foreign governmental authorities dupont is required to comply with other general business regulations covering areas such as income taxes anticorruption antibribery global trade trade sanctions environmental protections product safety and handling and production of regulated substances dupont expects to frequently face challenges from us and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due these challenges may include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 

in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions dupont expects to record reserves for estimates of potential additional tax dupont may owe any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or appropriately resolve these challenges could subject it to administrative civil and criminal remedies including fines penalties disgorgement injunctions and recalls of the company’s products and damage to the company’s reputation 

  

governmental policies including antitrust and competition law trade restrictions regulations related to medical applications and devices food safety regulations sustainability requirements traceability and other government regulations and mandates can impact the company’s ability to execute this strategy successfully see also “a significant percentage of the company’s net sales are generated from the company’s international operations and are subject to the economic political regulatory foreign exchange and other risks” 

failure to maintain a streamlined operating model and sustain operational improvements may reduce the company’s profitability or adversely impact the company’s business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the company’s profitability and margin growth will depend in part on the company’s ability to maintain a streamlined operating model and drive sustainable improvements through actions and projects such as consolidation of manufacturing facilities transitions to costcompetitive regions and product line rationalizations a variety of factors may adversely affect the company’s ability to realize the targeted cost synergies including failure to successfully optimize the company’s facilities footprint the failure to take advantage of the company’s global supply chain the failure to identify and eliminate duplicative programs and the failure to otherwise integrate historical eid’s or historical dow’s respective specialty products businesses including their technology platforms there can be no assurance that dupont is be able to achieve or sustain any or all of the cost savings generated from restructuring actions 

the company’s us and nonus tax liabilities will be dependent in part upon the distribution of income among various jurisdictions in which dupont operates 

the company’s future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in tax laws regulations and judicial rulings or changes in the interpretation thereof changes in generally accepted accounting principles changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of the company’s tax exposures and various other governmental enforcement initiatives the company’s tax expense includes estimates of tax reserves and reflects other estimates and assumptions including assessments of future earnings of the company which could impact the valuation of the company’s deferred tax assets changes in tax laws or regulations including further regulatory developments arising from us tax reform legislation as well as multijurisdictional changes enacted in response to the action items provided by the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd will increase tax uncertainty and impact the company’s provision for income taxes

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements 

critical accounting estimates 

the companys significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the companys operating results and financial condition 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts including but not limited to receivable and inventory valuations impairment of tangible and intangible assets longterm employee benefit obligations income taxes restructuring liabilities environmental matters and litigation managements estimates are based on historical experience facts and circumstances available at the time and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable the company reviews these matters and reflects changes in estimates as appropriate management believes that the following represent some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the companys accounting policies which could have a material effect on the companys financial position liquidity or results of operations 

pension plans 

accounting for employee benefit plans involves numerous assumptions and estimates discount rate and expected return on plan assets are two critical assumptions in measuring the cost and benefit obligation of the companys pension plans management reviews these two key assumptions when plans are remeasured these and other assumptions are updated periodically to reflect the actual experience and expectations on a plan specific basis as appropriate as permitted by gaap actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated on a plan by plan basis and to the extent that such differences exceed 10 percent of the greater of the plans benefit obligation or the applicable plan assets the excess is amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees or the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants if all or almost all of a plan’s participants are inactive 

for the majority of the benefit plans the company utilizes the aon aa corporate bond yield curves to determine the discount rate applicable to each country at the measurement date 

the company establishes strategic asset allocation percentage targets and appropriate benchmarks for significant asset classes in accordance with the laws and practices of those countries where appropriate assetliability studies are also taken into consideration for plans the longterm expected return on plan assets pension expense is determined using the fair value of assets 

the following table highlights the potential impact on the companys pretax earnings due to changes in certain key assumptions with respect to the companys pension plans based on assets and liabilities at december 31 2019 



additional information with respect to pension plans liabilities and assumptions is discussed under longterm employee benefits beginning on page 59 and in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements

the companys results of operations could be affected by significant litigation adverse to the company including product liability claims patent infringement and antitrust claims and claims for third party property damage or personal injury stemming from alleged environmental torts the company records accruals for legal matters when the information available indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated management makes adjustments to these accruals to reflect the impact and status of negotiations settlements rulings advice of counsel and other information and events that may pertain to a particular matter predicting the outcome of claims and lawsuits and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates in making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters management considers many factors these factors include but are not limited to the nature of specific claims including unasserted claims the companys experience with similar types of claims the jurisdiction in which the matter is filed input from outside legal counsel the likelihood of resolving the matter through alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and the matters current status considerable judgment is required in determining whether to establish a litigation accrual when an adverse judgment is rendered against the company in a court proceeding in such situations the company will not recognize a loss if based upon a thorough review of all relevant facts and information management believes that it is probable that the pending judgment will be successfully overturned on appeal a detailed discussion of significant litigation matters is contained in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

the breadth of the companys operations and the global complexity of tax regulations require assessments of uncertainties and judgments in estimating taxes the company will ultimately pay the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions outcomes of tax litigation and resolution of disputes arising from federal state and international tax audits in the normal course of business the resolution of these uncertainties may result in adjustments to the companys tax assets and tax liabilities it is reasonably possible that changes to the company’s global unrecognized tax benefits could be significant however due to the uncertainty regarding the timing of completion of audits and possible outcomes a current estimate of the range of increases or decreases that may occur within the next twelve months cannot be made 

deferred income taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of the companys assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets the realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies for example changes in facts and circumstances that alter the probability that the company will realize deferred tax assets could result in recording a valuation allowance thereby reducing the deferred tax asset and generating a deferred tax expense in the relevant period in some situations these changes could be material 

at december 31 2019 the company had a net deferred tax liability balance of 33 billion net of a valuation allowance of 06 billion realization of deferred tax assets is expected to occur over an extended period of time as a result changes in tax laws assumptions with respect to future taxable income and tax planning strategies could result in adjustments to deferred tax assets see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details related to the deferred tax liability balance 

goodwill 

the assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are measured at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired including identified intangibles is recorded as goodwill the determination and allocation of fair value to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on various assumptions and valuation methodologies requiring considerable management judgment including estimates based on historical information current market data and future expectations the principal assumptions utilized in the companys valuation 

methodologies include the projected revenue earnings before interest depreciation and amortization ebitda margins the weighted average costs of capital the terminal growth rates and other market data although the estimates are deemed reasonable by management based on information available at the dates of acquisition those estimates are inherently uncertain 

assessment of the potential impairment of goodwill other intangible assets property plant and equipment investments in nonconsolidated affiliates and other assets is an integral part of the companys normal ongoing review of operations testing for potential impairment of these assets is significantly dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects managements best estimates at a particular point in time the dynamic economic environments in which the companys diversified product lines operate and key economic and product line assumptions with respect to projected selling prices market growth and inflation rates can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results changes in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments as well as the time in which such impairments are recognized in addition the company continually reviews its diverse portfolio of assets to ensure they are achieving their greatest potential and are aligned with the companys growth strategy strategic decisions involving a particular group of assets may trigger an assessment of the recoverability of the related assets such an assessment could result in impairment losses 

the company performs goodwill impairment testing at the reporting unit level which is defined as the operating segment or one level below the operating segment one level below the operating segment or component is a business in which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management the company aggregates certain components into reporting units based on economic similarities subsequent to the distributions and as part of the second quarter segment realignment the company assessed and redefined certain reporting units effective june 1 2019 the company tests goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit has declined below its carrying value as of the date of the annual impairment test the company identified nine reporting units of which seven have goodwill assigned 

for purposes of goodwill impairment testing the company has the option to first perform qualitative testing to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value qualitative factors assessed at the company level include but are not limited to gdp growth rates longterm commodity prices equity and credit market activity discount rates foreign exchange rates and overall financial performance qualitative factors assessed at the reporting unit level include but are not limited to changes in industry and market structure competitive environments planned capacity and new product launches cost factors such as raw material prices and financial performance of the reporting unit if the company chooses not to complete a qualitative assessment for a given reporting unit or if the initial assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value additional quantitative testing is required 

if additional quantitative testing is performed the reporting unit’s fair value is compared with its carrying amount and an impairment charge if any is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value the company determined fair values for each of the reporting units using a combination of the income approach and market approach 

under the income approach fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at an appropriate riskadjusted rate the company uses its internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and includes an estimate of longterm future growth rates based on its most recent views of the longterm outlook for each reporting unit the discounted cash flow valuations are completed using the following key assumptions projected revenue growth rates discount rates tax rates and terminal values these key assumptions are determined through evaluation of the company as a whole and underlying business fundamentals and industry risk actual results may differ from those assumed in the company’s forecasts the company derives its discount rates using a capital asset pricing model and analyzing published rates for industries relevant to its reporting units to estimate the cost of equity financing the company uses discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective reporting units and in its internally developed forecasts discount rates used in the company’s reporting unit valuations ranged from 725 to 975 

under the market approach the company used the guideline public company method gpcm the selected peer sets were based on close competitors and reviews of analysts reports public filings and industry research related to firms operating in the respective reporting units industries in selecting the ebitebitda multiples and determining the fair value the company considered the size growth and profitability of each reporting unit versus the relevant guideline public companies 

estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described above could change in future periods 

2019 interim goodwill impairment testing 

during the second quarter of 2019 the internal sp distribution and the second quarter segment realignment served as triggering events requiring the company to perform impairment analyses related to goodwill this analysis resulted in an aggregate pretax noncash impairment charge of 1175 million impacting the nutrition  biosciences and noncore segments 

the company performed an interim impairment analysis for all reporting units using a discounted cash flow model a form of the income approach utilizing level 3 unobservable inputs the company’s significant estimates in this analysis include but are not limited to future cash flow projections the weighted average cost of capital the terminal growth rate and the tax rate the company believes the assumptions and estimates utilized are both reasonable and appropriate the key assumption driving the change in fair value was the lower financial projections resulting from developing market conditions events and circumstances that evolved throughout 2019 future cash flow estimates are by their nature subjective and actual results may differ materially from the company’s estimates if the company’s ongoing estimates of future cash flows are not met the company may have to record additional impairment charges in future periods the company’s estimates of future cash flows are based on current regulatory and economic climates recent operating results and planned business strategy these estimates could be negatively affected by changes in federal state or local regulations or economic downturns the impairment charges impacting the noncore segment were determined through utilization of the market approach which was considered most appropriate as the company continues to evaluate strategic options for these businesses the assumptions and estimates used in determining the fair values of the reporting units contain uncertainties and any changes to these assumptions and estimates could have a negative impact and result in a future impairment for further information see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

2019 annual goodwill impairment testing 

in the fourth quarter of 2019 quantitative testing was performed on all of the company’s reporting units that carry goodwill based on the results of the testing the estimated fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded their carrying values the dynamic economic environments in which the companys diversified product lines operate and key economic and product line assumptions with respect to projected selling prices market growth and inflation rates can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results certain reporting units within the noncore segment have limited headroom and changes in factors circumstances and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments as well as the time in which such impairments are recognized 

contractual obligations 

information related to the companys significant contractual obligations is summarized in the following table 



 

the company expects to meet its contractual obligations through its normal sources of liquidity and believes it has the financial resources to satisfy the contractual obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business 

longterm employee benefits 

the company has various obligations to its employees and retirees the company maintains retirementrelated programs in many countries that have a longterm impact on the companys earnings and cash flows these plans are typically defined benefit pension plans the company has a few medical dental and life insurance benefits for employees pensioners and survivors and for employees other post employment benefits or opeb plans 

pension coverage for employees of the companys nonus consolidated subsidiaries is provided to the extent deemed appropriate through separate plans the company regularly explores alternative solutions to meet its global pension obligations in the most cost effective manner possible as demographics life expectancy and countryspecific pension funding rules change where permitted by applicable law the company reserves the right to change modify or discontinue its plans that provide pension medical dental and life insurance benefits under defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on years of service and employees pay near retirement 

pension benefits are paid primarily from trust funds established to comply with applicable laws and regulations of the sovereign country in which the pension plan operates unless required by law the company does not make contributions that are in excess of tax deductible limits the actuarial assumptions and procedures utilized are reviewed periodically by the plans actuaries to provide reasonable assurance that there will be adequate funds for the payment of benefits thus there is not necessarily a direct correlation between pension funding and pension expense in general however improvements in plans funded status tends to moderate subsequent funding needs 

the company contributed 487 million 93 million and 30 million to its funded pension plans for the years ended december 31 2019 december 31 2018 and december 31 2017 respectively 

the company does maintain one us pension benefit plan this plan is a separate unfunded plan and these benefits are paid to employees from operating cash flows the companys remaining pension plans with no plan assets are paid from operating cash flows the company made benefit payments of 71 million 61 million and 21 million to its unfunded plans for the years ended december 31 2019 december 31 2018 and december 31 2017 respectively 

the companys opeb plans are unfunded and the cost is paid from operating cash flows pretax cash requirements to cover payments for the companys opeb plans was 1 million for the years ended december 31 2019 and december 31 2018 for the year ended december 31 2017 the pretax cash requirement was immaterial 

in 2020 the company expects to contribute approximately 85 million to its funded pension plans and its remaining plans with no plan assets and about 1 million for its opeb plans the amount and timing of actual future contributions will depend on applicable funding requirements discount rates investment performance plan design and various other factors 

the companys income can be significantly affected by pension and defined contribution chargesbenefits as well as opeb costs the following table summarizes the extent to which the companys income for the years ended december 31 2019 december 31 2018 and december 31 2017 was affected by pretax charges related to longterm employee benefits 



the above charges benefit for pension and opeb are determined as of the beginning of each period see pension plans and other post employment benefits under the critical accounting estimates section beginning on page 55 of this report for additional information on determining annual expense 

for 2020 long term employee benefit expense from continuing operations is expected to increase by about 35 million the increase is mainly due to lower expected return on plan assets 

environmental matters 

the company operates global manufacturing product handling and distribution facilities that are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations such rules are subject to change by the implementing governmental agency and the company monitors these changes closely company policy requires that all operations fully meet or exceed legal and regulatory requirements in addition the company implements voluntary programs to reduce air emissions minimize the generation of hazardous waste decrease the volume of water use and discharges increase the efficiency of energy use and reduce the generation of persistent bioaccumulative and toxic materials management has noted a global upward trend in the amount and complexity of proposed chemicals regulation the costs to comply with complex environmental laws and regulations as well as internal voluntary programs and goals are significant and will continue to be significant for the foreseeable future 

  

pretax environmental expenses charged to income from continuing operations are summarized below 



based on existing facts and circumstances management does not believe that yearoveryear changes if any in environmental expenses charged to current operations will have a material impact on the companys financial position liquidity or results of operations annual expenditures in the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures experienced in the past few years longer term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly 

environmental operating costs 

as a result of its operations the company incurs costs for pollution abatement activities including waste collection and disposal installation and maintenance of air pollution controls and wastewater treatment emissions testing and monitoring and obtaining permits the company also incurs costs related to environmental related research and development activities including environmental field and treatment studies as well as toxicity and degradation testing to evaluate the environmental impact of products and raw materials 

remediation accrual 

changes in the remediation accrual balance are summarized below 



 

considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs and under adverse changes in circumstances the potential liability may range up to 170 million above the amount accrued as of december 31 2019 however based on existing facts and circumstances management does not believe that any loss in excess of amounts accrued related to remediation activities at any individual site will have a material impact on the financial position liquidity or results of operations of the company 

pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and the letter agreement discussed in notes 4 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements the company indemnifies dow and corteva for certain environmental matters the company has recorded an indemnification liability of 42 million corresponding to the companys accrual balance related to these matters at december 31 2019 the indemnification liability is included in the total remediation accrual liability of 77 million  

environmental capital expenditures 

capital expenditures for environmental projects either required by law or necessary to meet the company’s internal environmental goals were 33 million for the year ended december 31 2019 the company currently estimates expenditures for environmentalrelated capital projects to be approximately 35 million in 2020 

climate change 

the company believes that climate change is an important global issue that presents risks and opportunities for instance the company continuously evaluates opportunities for existing and new product and service offerings to meet the anticipated demands of a lowcarbon economy in 2019 the company announced nine new sustainability goals including an acting on climate goal to achieve a 30 percent reduction in absolute greenhouse gas ghg emissions by 2030 and carbon neutral operations by 2050 dupont reports on its progress against these goals in its annual sustainability report 

the company is actively engaged in efforts to develop constructive public policies to reduce ghg emissions and encourage lowercarbon forms of energy such policies may bring higher operating costs as well as greater revenue and margin opportunities legislative efforts to control or limit ghg emissions could affect the companys energy source and supply choices as well as increase the cost of energy and raw materials derived from fossil fuels such efforts are also anticipated to provide the business community with greater certainty for the regulatory future help guide investment decisions and drive growth in demand for lowcarbon and energyefficient products technologies and services similarly demand is expected to grow for products that facilitate adaptation to a changing climate however the current unsettled policy environment in the us where many company facilities are located adds an element of uncertainty to business decisions particularly those relating to longterm capital investments 

in addition significant differences in regional or national approaches could present challenges in a global marketplace an effective global climate policy framework will help drive the market changes that are needed to stimulate and efficiently deploy new innovations in science and technology while maintaining open and competitive global markets 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company’s global operations are exposed to financial market risks relating to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates the company has established a variety of programs including the use of derivative instruments and other financial instruments to manage the exposure to financial market risks as to minimize volatility of financial results in the ordinary course of business the company enters into derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign currency interest rate and commodity price risks under established procedures and controls for additional information on these derivatives and related exposures see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements decisions regarding whether or not to hedge a given commitment are made on a casebycase basis taking into consideration the amount and duration of the exposure market volatility and economic trends foreign currency exchange contracts are also used from time to time to manage nearterm foreign currency cash requirements 

foreign currency exchange rate risks 

the company has significant international operations resulting in a large number of currency transactions that result from international sales purchases investments and borrowings the primary currencies for which the company has an exchange rate exposure are the european euro eur chinese renminbi taiwan dollar swiss franc and south korean won the company uses forward exchange contracts to offset its net exposures by currency related to the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities of its operations in addition to the contracts disclosed in note 22 to the consolidated financial statements from time to time the company will enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to establish with certainty the us dollar usd amount of future firm commitments denominated in a foreign currency 

the following table illustrates the fair values of outstanding foreign currency contracts at december 31 2019  and the effect on fair values of a hypothetical adverse change in the foreign exchange rates that existed at december 31 2019  the sensitivities for foreign currency contracts are based on a 10 percent adverse change in foreign exchange rates 



since the companys risk management programs are highly effective the potential loss in value for each risk management portfolio described above would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure 

concentration of credit risk 

the company maintains cash and cash equivalents marketable securities derivatives and certain other financial instruments with various financial institutions these financial institutions are generally highly rated and geographically dispersed and the company has a policy to limit the dollar amount of credit exposure with any one institution 

as part of the companys financial risk management processes it continuously evaluates the relative credit standing of all of the financial institutions that service dupont and monitors actual exposures versus established limits the company has not sustained credit losses from instruments held at financial institutions 

the companys sales are not materially dependent on any single customer as of december 31 2019  no one individual customer balance represented more than five percent of the companys total outstanding receivables balance credit risk associated with its receivables balance is representative of the geographic industry and customer diversity associated with the companys global product lines 

the company also maintains strong credit controls in evaluating and granting customer credit as a result it may require that customers provide some type of financial guarantee in certain circumstances length of terms for customer credit varies by industry and region

the intended business separations 

dowdupont plans to separate into three independent publicly traded companies  one for each of its agriculture materials science and specialty products businesses the “intended business separations” and the transactions to accomplish the intended business separations the “separations” dowdupont has formed two wholly owned subsidiaries dow holdings inc to serve as a holding company for its materials science business and corteva inc to serve as a holding company for its agriculture business 

in furtherance of the intended business separations dowdupont is engaged in a series of internal reorganization and realignment steps the “internal reorganization” to realign its businesses into three subgroups agriculture materials science and specialty products as part of the internal reorganization the assets and liabilities aligned with the materials science business will be transferred or conveyed to legal entities that will ultimately be subsidiaries of dow holdings inc and the assets and liabilities aligned with the agriculture business will be transferred or conveyed to legal entities that will ultimately be subsidiaries of corteva inc 

following the internal reorganization dowdupont expects to distribute its materials science and agriculture businesses through two separate us federal taxfree spinoffs in which dowdupont stockholders at the time of such spinoffs will receive a pro rata dividend of the shares of the capital stock of dow holdings inc and of corteva inc as applicable the “distributions” the materials science business after the consummation of the applicable internal reorganization will be referred to as “dow” and the agriculture business after the consummation of the applicable internal reorganization will be referred to as “corteva” following the separation and distribution of dow which is targeted to occur on april 1 2019 dowdupont as the remaining company will continue to hold the agriculture and specialty products businesses dowdupont is then targeted to complete the separation and distribution of corteva on june 1 2019 resulting in dowdupont holding the specialty products businesses of the combined company after the distribution of corteva it is expected that dowdupont will become known as dupont 

prior to the distribution of dow dowdupont intends to enter into a separation agreement with corteva and dow the “separation agreement” setting forth the agreement among the parties regarding the principal actions to be taken in connection with the separations under the separation agreement certain environmental and legal liabilities will be allocated among dupont dow and corteva those liabilities primarily related to dowdupont’s specialty products businesses materials science business and agriculture business will generally be retained or assumed by dupont dow and corteva respectively unless otherwise specifically allocated 

with respect to environmental and legal liabilities from discontinued andor divested operations and businesses those of historical dow will be retained or assumed by dow and those of historical dupont will be retained or assumed by corteva or dupont according to the terms of the separation agreement 

these liability allocations will be implemented through transfer or substitution if possible or indemnity 

in the fourth quarter of 2018 dowdupont consummated a public underwritten offer of eight series of senior unsecured notes the dowdupont notes in an aggregate principal amount of 127 billion see the discussion of the dowdupont notes in liquidity and capital resources in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

 item 1a risk factors 

the factors described below represent the companys principal risks 

dowdupont may be unable to achieve all the benefits that it expects to achieve from the merger and the intended business separations   

the success of the merger ultimately depends on among other things dowduponts ability to combine and separate the historical dupont and historical dow businesses in a manner that facilitates the intended business separations and realizes anticipated synergies 

since the merger   dowdupont has benefited from and expects to continue to benefit from significant cost synergies at both the business and corporate levels through the dowdupont cost synergy program the synergy program which is designed to integrate and optimize the organization including through the achievement of production cost efficiencies enhancement of the agricultural supply chain elimination of duplicative agricultural research and development programs optimization of the combined company’s global footprint across manufacturing sales and research and development optimizing manufacturing processes in the electronics space the reduction of corporate and leveraged services costs and the realization of significant procurement synergies in connection with the synergy program dowdupont expects to record total pretax restructuring charges of approximately 2 billion  of which 1747 million  has been recorded inceptiontodate through december 31 2018 comprised of approximately 895 million  to 975 million  of severance and related benefit costs of which 933 million  has been recorded inceptiontodate through december 31 2018 525 million  to 615 million  of asset writedowns and writeoffs of which 579 million  has been recorded inceptiontodate through december 31 2018 and 370 million  to 410 million  of costs associated with exit and disposal activities of which 235 million  has been recorded inceptiontodate through december 31 2018 

management also expects to achieve growth synergies and other meaningful savings and benefits as a result of the intended business separations 

combining historical dupont and historical dows independent businesses and preparing for the intended business separations including through the internal reorganization are complex costly and timeconsuming processes and the management of dowdupont may face significant implementation challenges many of which may be beyond the control of management including without limitation 

 

some of these factors will be outside of the control of dowdupont and any one of them could result in increased costs and diversion of management’s time and energy as well as decreases in the amount of expected revenue which could materially impact dowduponts business financial condition and results of operations the internal reorganization and intended business separation processes and other disruptions may also adversely affect the combined company’s relationships with employees suppliers customers distributors licensors and others with whom historical dupont and historical dow have business or other dealings and difficulties in integrating the businesses or regulatory functions of historical dupont and historical dow could harm the reputation of dowdupont 

if the anticipated benefits and cost savings including from the synergy program of the merger including the intended business separations are not realized fully or take longer to realize than expected the value of dowdupont common stock its revenues levels of expenses and results of operations may be affected adversely a variety of factors may adversely affect the companys ability to fully and timely realize the currently expected synergies savings and other benefits of the merger including failure to 

successfully optimize the combined companys facilities footprint the failure to take advantage of the combined companys global supply chain the failure to identify and eliminate duplicative programs and the failure to otherwise integrate duponts or dows respective businesses including their technology platforms 

dowdupont has incurred significant costs and expects to incur additional costs in connection with the integration of historical dupont and historical dow and the intended business separations 

there are many processes policies procedures operations technologies and systems that were integrated following the merger and must be replicated transferred or separated in connection with the intended business separations these costs primarily consist of financial advisory information technology legal consulting and other professional advisory fees associated with preparation and execution of these activities   while dowdupont has assumed a certain level of expense would be incurred in connection with these activities there are many factors beyond the combined company’s control that could affect the total amount or the timing of anticipated expenses 

there may also be additional unanticipated significant costs incurred in connection with the intended business separations that dowdupont may not recoup that could reduce the benefits and additional income dowdupont expects to achieve from the merger although dowdupont expects that these benefits will offset the transaction expenses and implementation costs over time this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all 

the determination to proceed with the intended business separations is a decision of the dowdupont board of directors and the expected benefits of such transactions if they occur will be uncertain 

in the event that the dowdupont board of directors board determines to proceed with the intended business separations it is currently anticipated that any such intended business separation transaction would be effectuated through the distribution of dow followed by the distribution of corteva in separate prorata spinoff transactions in which dowdupont stockholders at such time would receive a prorata dividend of the shares of capital stock of dow holdings inc and corteva inc resulting in three independent public companies the board may ultimately determine to abandon one or more of the intended business separation transactions and such determination could have an adverse impact on dowdupont including that dowdupont will be required to redeem each series of dowdupont notes at a redemption price equal to 101 percent of the principal amount of such series of dowdupont notes plus accrued and unpaid interest there are many factors that could prior to the determination by the board to proceed with the intended business separations impact the structure or timing of the anticipated benefits from or determination to ultimately proceed with the intended business separations including among others global economic conditions instability in credit markets declining consumer and business confidence fluctuating commodity prices and interest rates volatile foreign currency exchange rates tax considerations a full or partial shutdown of the us federal government other challenges that could affect the global economy specific market conditions in one or more of the industries of the businesses proposed to be separated and changes in the regulatory or legal environment such changes could adversely impact the value of one or more of the intended business separation transactions to the combined company’s stockholders additionally to the extent the board determines to proceed with the intended business separations the consummation of such transactions is a complex costly and timeconsuming process and there can be no guarantee that the intended benefits of such transactions will be achieved an inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the intended business separations as well as any delays encountered in the process could have an adverse effect upon the revenues level of expenses and operating results of the agriculture business the materials science business the specialty products business andor the combined company 

inability to access the debt capital markets could impair dowduponts liquidity business or financial condition 

dowdupont’s primary sources of liquidity to finance operations including dividends on its common stock are through historical dupont and historical dow and their respective consolidated subsidiaries collectively the “subsidiaries” each of historical dupont and historical dow has relied and continues to rely on access to the debt capital markets to finance their daytoday and longterm operations any limitation on the part of either historical dupont’s or historical dow’s ability to raise money in the debt markets could have a substantial negative effect on their respective liquidity and the liquidity of dowdupont access to the debt capital markets in amounts adequate to finance each subsidiary’s activities could be impaired as a result of the existence of material nonpublic information about the intended business separations and other potential factors including factors that are not specific to the subsidiaries such as a severe disruption of the financial markets and interest rate fluctuations 

prior to the intended business separations if pursued the level and quality of the respective earnings operations business and management among other things of each of historical dupont and historical dow will impact their respective credit ratings costs and availability of financing and those of the combined company a decrease in the ratings assigned to historical dupont or historical dow by the ratings agencies may negatively impact their access to the debt capital markets and increase the combined company’s cost of borrowing there can be no assurance that historical dupont and historical dow will maintain their current credit worthiness or prospective credit ratings any actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in such credit ratings may have a negative impact on the liquidity capital position or access to capital markets of historical dupont and historical dow and therefore dowdupont 

if either distribution together with certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for nonrecognition treatment for us federal income tax purposes then the company could be subject to significant tax and indemnification liability 

it is a condition to each distribution that dowdupont receive a tax opinion from skadden arps slate meagher  flom llp its tax counsel in form and substance acceptable to dowdupont substantially to the effect that among other things the applicable distribution along with certain related transactions will qualify as a taxfree transaction under section 355 and section 368a1d of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” and such opinions collectively the “tax opinions” the tax opinions will rely on certain facts assumptions and undertakings and certain representations from dowdupont dow and corteva regarding the past and future conduct of each of the three businesses and other matters including those discussed in the risk factor immediately below as well as the irs ruling as defined below notwithstanding the tax opinions and the irs ruling the internal revenue service the “irs” could determine on audit that either or both of the distributions and certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or that the distributions should be taxable for other reasons including if the irs were to disagree with the conclusions of the tax opinions 

since dowdupont intends to make a protective election under section 336e of the code for dow and each of dow’s domestic corporate subsidiaries with respect to the distribution of dow in the event the distribution of dow is ultimately determined to be taxable the company would recognize corporate level taxable gain to the extent the fair market value of the assets excluding stock in any domestic corporate subsidiary of dow and its domestic corporate subsidiaries exceeds the basis of dow and its corporate subsidiaries in such assets if the distribution of corteva ultimately is determined to be taxable then the company would recognize corporate level taxable gain on the distribution in an amount equal to the excess if any of the fair market value of corteva common stock held by dowdupont’s stockholders on the applicable distribution date over dowduponts tax basis in such stock in addition if certain related transactions related to the distributions fail to qualify for taxfree treatment under us federal state and local tax law andor foreign tax law the company dow and corteva could incur significant tax liabilities under us federal state local andor foreign tax law 

generally corporate taxes resulting from the failure of a distribution to qualify for nonrecognition treatment for us federal income tax purposes would be imposed on the company under the tax matters agreement that dowdupont will enter into with dow and corteva subject to the exceptions described below dow and corteva are generally obligated to indemnify the company against any such taxes imposed on it however if a distribution fails to qualify for nonrecognition treatment for us federal income tax purposes for certain reasons relating to the overall structure of the merger and the distributions then under the tax matters agreement the company and dow would share the tax liability resulting from such failure in accordance with their relative equity values on the first full trading day following the distribution of dow the companys responsibility for any such taxes is expected to be shared between the company and corteva following the distribution of corteva in accordance with a fixed percentage to be agreed by the parties though absent any such agreement following the distribution of corteva the company would be responsible for all such liabilities furthermore under the terms of the tax matters agreement the company also generally will be responsible for any taxes imposed on corteva or dow that arise from the failure of either distribution to qualify as taxfree for us federal income tax purposes within the meaning of section 355 of the code or the failure of certain related transactions to qualify for taxfree treatment to the extent such failure to qualify is attributable to actions events or transactions relating to dowduponts or dowduponts affiliates’ stock assets or business or any breach of the companys representations made in connection with the irs ruling or in any representation letter provided to a tax advisor in connection with certain tax opinions including the tax opinions regarding the taxfree status of the distributions and certain related transactions prior to the distribution of corteva the company and corteva are expected to reach an agreement regarding the sharing of responsibility for all liabilities of the company described in the preceding sentence as a result of actions or transactions of the company preceding the distribution of corteva absent any such agreement following the distribution of corteva the company will be responsible for all such liabilities dow and corteva will be separately responsible for any taxes imposed on the company that arise from the failure of a distribution to qualify as taxfree for us federal income tax purposes within the meaning of section 355 of the code or the failure of certain related transactions to qualify for taxfree treatment to the extent such failure to qualify is attributable to actions events or transactions relating to such company’s or its affiliates’ stock assets or business or any breach of such company’s representations made in connection with the irs ruling or in any representation letter provided to a tax advisor in connection with certain tax opinions including the tax opinions regarding the taxfree status of the distributions and certain related transactions events triggering an indemnification obligation under the tax matters agreement include events occurring after the distribution that cause the company dow or corteva to recognize gain under section 355e of the code as discussed further below such tax amounts could be significant to the extent that the company is responsible for any liability under the tax matters agreement there could be a material adverse impact on the companys business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in future reporting periods 

the irs may asse rt that the merger causes the distributions and other related transactions to be taxable to dowdupont  

even if a distribution otherwise constitutes a taxfree transaction to stockholders under section 355 of the code the company may be required to recognize corporate level tax on such distribution and certain related transactions under section 355e of the 

code if as a result of the merger or other transactions considered part of a plan with such distribution there is a 50 percent or greater change in ownership in dowdupont dow or corteva as relevant in connection with the merger dowdupont sought and received a private letter ruling from the irs regarding the proper time manner and methodology for measuring common ownership in the stock of dowdupont historical dupont and historical dow for purposes of determining whether there has been a 50 percent or greater change of ownership under section 355e of the code as a result of the merger the “irs ruling” the tax opinions will rely on the continued validity of the irs ruling as well as certain factual representations from dowdupont as to the extent of common ownership of the stock of historical dow and historical dupont immediately prior to the merger in addition it is a condition to the distributions that the irs has not revoked the irs ruling based on the representations made by dowdupont as to the common ownership of the stock of historical dow and historical dupont immediately prior to the merger and assuming the continued validity of the irs ruling the tax opinions will conclude that there was not a 50 percent or greater change of ownership in dowdupont historical dow or historical dupont for purposes of section 355e as a result of the merger notwithstanding the tax opinions and the irs ruling the irs could determine that a distribution or a related transaction should nevertheless be treated as a taxable transaction to the company if it determines that any of the company’s facts assumptions representations or undertakings is not correct or that a distribution should be taxable for other reasons including if the irs were to disagree with the conclusions in the tax opinions that are not covered by the irs ruling 

the separations and distributions may expose the company to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal distribution requirements 

although dowdupont will receive solvency opinions from an investment bank confirming that dupont dow and corteva will each be adequately capitalized following the separations and distributions the separations and distributions could be challenged under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws fraudulent conveyances or transfers are generally defined to include transfers made or obligations incurred with the actual intent to hinder delay or defraud current or future creditors or transfers made or obligations incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value when the debtor was insolvent or that rendered the debtor insolvent inadequately capitalized or unable to pay its debts as they become due any unpaid creditor could claim that the company did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value in the separations and distributions and that the separations and distributions left the company insolvent or with unreasonably small capital or that it intended or believed the company would incur debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature if a court were to agree with such a plaintiff then such court could void the separations and distributions as a fraudulent transfer or impose substantial liabilities on the company which could adversely affect dowduponts financial condition and results of operations 

the distributions are also subject to review under state corporate distribution statutes under the delaware general corporation law a corporation may only pay dividends to its stockholders either i out of its surplus net assets minus capital or ii if there is no such surplus out of its net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared andor the preceding fiscal year although the board intends to make the distributions out of dowdupont’s surplus and will receive an opinion that dowdupont has adequate surplus under delaware law to declare the dividends of corteva and dow common stock in connection with the distributions there can be no assurance that a court will not later determine that some or all of the distributions were unlawful 

the company may be required to redeem the dowdupont notes which could adversely impact its financial position results of operations and liquidity 

if each of the separations and distributions has not been completed on or before may 1 2020 or if prior to such date dowdupont has abandoned any of the separations or distributions the company will be required to redeem each series of dowdupont notes at a redemption price equal to 101 percent of the principal amount of such series of dowdupont notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the redemption date 

the company is not required to retain any of the net proceeds from the dowdupont notes and has stated its intent to use the net proceeds of the dowdupont notes together with borrowings under the term loan facilities to i reduce outstanding liabilities that would otherwise be allocable to dow and corteva ii repurchase up to 30 billion of dowdupont’s common stock pursuant to dowdupont’s previously announced share repurchase program and iii pay any related premiums fees and expenses accordingly the company would fund any special mandatory redemption using proceeds that it has voluntarily retained or from other sources of liquidity in the event of a special mandatory redemption the company may not have sufficient funds to purchase all of the dowdupont notes 

dowdupont is exposed to the risks related to international sales and operations 

the company’s businesses each derive a large portion of their total sales and revenues from operations outside of the united states therefore dowdupont will have exposure to risks of operating in many foreign countries including 



 

any one or more of the above factors could adversely affect the international operations of the combined company and could significantly affect the combined company’s results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

availability of purchased feedstock and energy and the volatility of these costs impact the companys operating costs and add variability to earnings 

primarily in support of its materials science businesses the company purchases hydrocarbon raw materials including ethane propane butane naphtha and condensate as feedstocks the company also purchases certain monomers primarily ethylene and propylene to supplement internal production as well as other raw materials the company purchases natural gas primarily to generate electricity and purchases electric power to supplement internal generation 

feedstock and energy costs generally follow price trends in crude oil and natural gas which are sometimes volatile while the company uses its feedstock flexibility and financial and physical hedging programs to help mitigate feedstock cost increases the company is not always able to immediately raise selling prices ultimately the ability to pass on underlying cost increases is dependent on market conditions conversely when feedstock and energy costs decline selling prices generally decline as well as a result volatility in these costs could impact the company’s results of operations 

the company has a number of investments on the us gulf coast to take advantage of increasing supplies of lowcost natural gas and natural gas liquids ngls derived from shale gas while the company expects abundant and costadvantaged supplies of ngls in the united states to persist for the foreseeable future if ngls become significantly less advantaged than crude oilbased feedstocks it could have a negative impact on the company’s results of operations and future investments also if the company’s key suppliers of feedstocks and energy are unable to provide the raw materials required for production it could have a negative impact on the companys results of operations 

earnings generated by the companys products vary based in part on the balance of supply relative to demand within the industry 

the balance of supply relative to demand within the industry may be significantly impacted by the addition of new capacity especially for basic commodities where capacity is generally added in large increments as worldscale facilities are built this may disrupt industry balances and result in downward pressure on prices due to the increase in supply which could negatively impact the companys results of operations 

the costs of complying with evolving regulatory requirements could negatively impact the companys financial results actual or alleged violations of environmental laws or permit requirements could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations substantial civil or criminal sanctions as well as the assessment of strict liability andor joint and several liability 

the company is subject to extensive federal state local and foreign laws regulations rules and ordinances relating to pollution protection of the environment greenhouse gas emissions and the generation storage handling transportation treatment disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials costs and capital expenditures relating to environmental health or safety matters are subject to evolving regulatory requirements and depend on the timing of the promulgation and enforcement of specific standards which impose the requirements moreover changes in environmental regulations could inhibit or interrupt the companys operations or require modifications to its facilities accordingly environmental health or safety regulatory matters could result in significant unanticipated costs or liabilities 

the company’s business results of operations and reputation could be adversely affected by industryspecific risks including process safety and product stewardshipregulatory compliance issues 

the company is subject to industryspecific risks concerns and claims which include but are not limited to product safety or quality shifting consumer preferences that include  a growing trend in societal demands for increasing levels of product safety 

and environmental protection  federal state and local regulations on manufacturing or labeling environmental health and safety regulations and customer product liability claims in the agriculture segment industryspecific risks include those associated with concerns and claims regarding the safe use of seeds with biotechnology traits crop protection products and chemicals their potential impact on health and the environment and the perceived impacts of biotechnology on health and the environment the latter includes concerns and claims that increased use of crop protection products drift inversion volatilization and the use of biotechnology traits meant to reduce the resistance of weeds or pests to control by crop protection products could increase or accelerate such resistance and otherwise negatively impact health and the environment also the detection of biotechnology traits or chemical residues from a crop protection product not approved in the country to which the company sells or imports it in which the product is cultivated or to which it exports may impact the company’s ability to supply or export agricultural products result in crop destruction product recalls or trade disruption 

the risks concerns and claims affecting the industries in which the company competes could manifest themselves in stockholder proposals preferred purchasing delays or failures in obtaining or retaining regulatory approvals delayed product launches lack of market acceptance product discontinuation continued pressure for and adoption of more stringent regulatory intervention and litigation termination of raw material supply agreements and legal claims these and other concerns or claims could also influence public perceptions the viability or continued sales of certain of the companys products the companys reputation and the cost to comply with regulations and could adversely affect the company’s business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in most jurisdictions the company must test the safety efficacy and environmental impact of its products to satisfy regulatory requirements and obtain the necessary approvals in certain jurisdictions the company must periodically renew its approvals which may require it to demonstrate compliance with thencurrent standards the regulatory environment is lengthy complex and in some markets unpredictable with requirements that can vary by product technology industry and country the regulatory environment may be impacted by the activities of nongovernmental organizations and special interest groups and stakeholder reaction to actual or perceived impacts of new technology products or processes on safety health and the environment obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals requires submitting a significant amount of information and data which may require participation from technology providers regulatory standards and trial procedures are continuously changing the pace of change together with the lack of regulatory harmony could result in unintended noncompliance responding to these changes and meeting existing and new requirements may involve significant costs or capital expenditures or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced profitability the failure to receive necessary permits or approvals could have near and longterm effects on the company’s ability to produce and sell some current and future products 

a significant operational event could negatively impact the companys results of operations 

disruptions in the company’s operations or those of its supply chain and customers the transportation of products acts of sabotage employee error malfeasance or other actions geopolitical activity cyberattacks or severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena such as drought hurricanes earthquakes tsunamis floods etc including hurricanes or flooding that impact coastal regions in the united states gulf region or asia pacific could result in an unplanned event that could be significant in scale and could negatively impact operations neighbors or the public at large which could have a negative impact on the companys results of operations 

in addition terrorist attacks and natural disasters have increased concerns about the security and safety of chemical production and distribution local state federal and foreign governments continue to propose new regulations related to the security of chemical plant locations and the transportation of hazardous chemicals which could result in higher operating costs 

the risk of loss of the company’s intellectual property trade secrets or other sensitive business information or disruption of operations could negatively impact the company’s financial results 

the company has attractive information assets including intellectual property trade secrets and other sensitive business critical information cyberattacks or security breaches affecting the company its supply chain or customers could compromise confidential business critical information cause a disruption in the company’s operations or harm the companys reputation  if the company its suppliers or customers do not effectively prevent detect and recover from these or other security breaches 

like most major corporations dowdupont and its subsidiaries are the target of industrial espionage including cyberattacks from time to time the company has determined that these attacks have resulted and could result in the future in unauthorized parties gaining access to certain confidential business information although management does not believe that the company or its subsidiaries have experienced any material losses to date related to these security breaches including cybersecurity incidents there can be no assurance that such losses will not be suffered in the future while the company has a comprehensive cyber security program that is continuously reviewed maintained and upgraded a significant cyberattack could result in the loss of critical business information andor could negatively impact operations which could have a negative impact on the company’s financial results 

the company seeks to actively manage the risks within its control that could lead to business disruptions and security breaches as these threats continue to evolve particularly around cybersecurity the company may be required to expend significant resources to enhance its control environment processes practices and other protective measures despite these efforts such events could have a material adverse effect on dowdupont’s business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

implementing certain elements of the companys strategy could negatively impact the companys financial results 

the company currently has manufacturing operations sales and marketing activities and joint ventures in emerging geographies activities in these geographic regions are accompanied by uncertainty and risks including navigating different government regulatory environments relationships with new local partners project funding commitments and guarantees expropriation military actions war terrorism and political instability sabotage uninsurable risks suppliers not performing as expected resulting in increased risk of extended project timelines and determining raw material supply and other details regarding product movement if the manufacturing operations sales and marketing activities andor implementation of these projects is not successful it could adversely affect the companys financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets could negatively impact the companys financial results 

at least annually the company assesses both goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment intangible assets with finite lives are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable if testing indicates that goodwill or intangible assets are impaired the carrying values are written down based on fair values with a charge against earnings where the company utilizes discounted cash flow methodologies in determining fair values changes in riskadjusted discount rates and continued weak demand for a specific product line or business could result in an impairment accordingly any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of goodwill or intangible assets could negatively impact the companys results of operations 

as a result of the merger and the related acquisition method of accounting historical dupont’s assets and liabilities were measured at fair value resulting in increases to the companys goodwill and other intangible assets of 455 billion and 271 billion respectively and any declines in financial projections could have a material negative impact on the fair value of the companys reporting units and assets particularly in the agriculture and specialty products divisions future impairments of goodwill or intangible assets could also be recorded due to changes in other assumptions estimates or circumstances and the magnitude of such impairments may be material to the company historical dupont or historical dow 

during the third quarter of 2018 in connection with strategic business reviews and assembling updated financial projections the company’s subsidiary historical dupont a separate us securities and exchange commission registrant was required to perform an interim test of goodwill for its agriculture reporting unit as a result of the analysis performed historical dupont recorded a pretax noncash goodwill impairment charge of 45 billion in its standalone quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended september 30 2018 however the impairment charge did not survive at the dowdupont level based on the analysis performed at the dowdupont level the fair value of the combined agriculture reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by more than 10 percent and therefore no goodwill impairment existed for the company during this same time the company also performed an impairment test on indefinitelived intangibles and determined that the fair value of certain inprocess research and development assets had declined as a result of delays in timing of commercialization and increases to expected research and development costs this resulted in the company recording a pretax impairment charge of 85 million see part ii item 7 other matters critical accounting estimates in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

increased obligations and expenses related to historical duponts and historical dows defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans could negatively impact dowduponts financial condition and results of operations 

historical dupont and historical dow have defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans collectively the “plans” in the united states and a number of other countries the assets of the historical dupont and historical dow funded plans are primarily invested in fixed income securities equity securities of us and foreign issuers and alternative investments including investments in real estate private market securities and absolute return strategies changes in the market value of plan assets investment returns discount rates mortality rates regulations and the rate of increase in compensation levels may affect the funded status of the plans and could cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost future funding requirements of the plans and the funded status of the plans a significant increase in historical duponts and historical dows obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on the companys results of operations and cash flows for a particular period and on the companys financial condition 

climate change and unpredictable seasonal and weather factors could impact sales and earnings of the company’s agriculture segment 

the agriculture industry is subject to seasonal and weather factors which can vary unpredictably from period to period weather  factors can affect the presence of disease and pests on a regional basis and accordingly can positively or adversely affect the 

demand for crop protection products including the mix of products used the weather also can affect the quality volume and cost of seed produced for sale as well as demand and product mix seed yields can be higher or lower than planned which could lead to higher inventory and related writeoffs climate change may increase the frequency or intensity of extreme weather such as storms floods heat waves droughts and other events that could affect the quality volume and cost of seed produced for sale as well   as demand and product mix climate change may also affect the availability and suitability of arable land and contribute to unpredictable shifts in the average growing season and types of crops produced 

inability to discover develop and protect new technologies and enforce the companys intellectual property rights and to respond to new technologies could adversely affect the companys financial results 

the company competes with major global companies that have strong intellectual property rights including rights supporting the use of biotechnology to enhance products particularly agricultural and biobased products speed in discovering developing protecting and responding to new technologies including new technologybased distribution channels that could impede the companys ability to engage with customers and end users and bringing related products to market is a significant competitive advantage failure to predict and respond effectively could cause the companys existing or candidate products to become less competitive adversely affecting sales competitors are increasingly challenging intellectual property positions and the outcomes can be highly uncertain if challenges are resolved adversely it could negatively impact the companys ability to obtain licenses on competitive terms commercialize new products and generate sales from existing products 

intellectual property rights including patents plant variety protection trade secrets confidential information trademarks trade names and other forms of trade dress are important to the companys business the company endeavors to protect its intellectual property rights in jurisdictions in which its products are produced or used and in jurisdictions into which its products are imported however the company may be unable to obtain protection for its intellectual property in key jurisdictions further changes in government policies and regulations including changes made in reaction to pressure from nongovernmental organizations could impact the extent of intellectual property protection afforded by such jurisdictions 

the majority of the company’s corn hybrids and soybean varieties sold to customers contain biotechnology traits that are licensed from third parties under longterm licenses if the company loses its rights under such licenses it could negatively impact the companys ability to obtain future licenses on competitive terms commercialize new products and generate sales from existing products 

the company has designed and implemented internal controls to restrict access to and distribution of its intellectual property despite these precautions the companys intellectual property is vulnerable to unauthorized access through employee error or actions theft and cybersecurity incidents and other security breaches when unauthorized access and use or counterfeit products are discovered the company reports such situations to governmental authorities for investigation as appropriate and takes measures to mitigate any potential impact protecting intellectual property related to biotechnology is particularly challenging because theft is difficult to detect and biotechnology can be selfreplicating accordingly the impact of such theft can be significant 

failure to effectively manage acquisitions divestitures alliances and other portfolio actions could adversely impact dowduponts future results 

the company made certain divestitures primarily related to its agriculture segment in connection with obtaining regulatory approval for the merger in addition the company from time to time evaluates acquisition candidates that may strategically fit its business andor growth objectives if the company is unable to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses the company could fail to achieve anticipated synergies and cost savings including any expected increases in revenues and operating results which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results the company continually reviews its portfolio of assets for contributions to the company’s objectives and alignment with its growth strategy however the company may not be successful in separating underperforming or nonstrategic assets and gains or losses on the divestiture of or lost operating income from such assets may affect the company’s earnings moreover the company might incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures that reduce its earnings in addition if the execution or implementation of acquisitions divestitures alliances joint ventures and other portfolio actions is not successful it could adversely impact the company’s financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

dowdupont’s results of operations could be adversely affected by litigation and other commitments and contingencies the company faces risks arising from various unasserted and asserted litigation matters including but not limited to asbestos related suits product liability patent infringement antitrust claims governmental regulations contract and commercial litigation claims for third party property damage or personal injury stemming from alleged environmental torts and other actions the company has noted a nationwide trend in purported class actions against chemical manufacturers generally seeking relief such as medical monitoring property damages offsite remediation and punitive damages arising from alleged environmental torts without claiming present personal injuries the company also has noted a trend in public and private suits being filed on behalf of states 

counties cities and utilities alleging harm to the general public and the environment including waterways and watersheds an adverse outcome in any one or more of these matters could be material to the companys financial results 

see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on litigation and other commitments and contingencies faced by the company 

in the ordinary course of business the company may make certain commitments including representations warranties and indemnities relating to current and past operations including those related to divested businesses and issue guarantees of third party obligations if the company were required to make payments as a result they could exceed the amounts accrued thereby adversely affecting the companys results of operations

continued penetration of new crop protection products vessarya® and zorvec tm  fungicides and continued demand for arylex tm  herbicide isoclast® insecticide and novel seed treatment solutions these volume increases were partially offset by higher crop protection inventory levels in china and a reduction in global corn planted area increases in local prices for seeds driven by continued penetration of leptra® corn hybrids were offset by a decrease in local prices for crop protection driven by competitive pressures in latin america 

the benefit from portfolio actions for 2017 as compared with 2016 is due to the das divested ag business which is excluded from pro forma results for periods prior to the merger but included in reported results after the merger and through the close of the sale of this business on november 30 2017

cash flows from investing activities 

cash used for investing activities in 2018  was primarily for capital expenditures and purchases of investments which were partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of investments and proceeds from interests in trade accounts receivable conduits cash provided by investing activities in 2017  was primarily from proceeds from interests in trade accounts receivable conduits cash acquired in the merger proceeds from sales and maturities of investments and divestitures including the divestitures of the das divested ag business the eaa business and certain assets related to historical duponts crop protection business and rd organization these items were partially offset by capital expenditures purchases of investments and loans to nonconsolidated affiliates primarily with sadara cash provided by investing activities in 2016 was primarily from proceeds from interests in trade accounts receivable conduits and net cash acquired in the dow silicones ownership restructure which were partially offset by capital expenditures and investments in and loans to nonconsolidated affiliates primarily with sadara

reclassification of prior year amounts related to accounts receivable securitization

began reducing outstanding balances through collections of trade accounts receivable previously sold to such conduits in september and october 2018 the north american and european facilities respectively were amended and the terms of the agreements changed from offbalance sheet arrangements to secured borrowing arrangements 

the following table reconciles cash flows from operating activities to a nongaap measure regarding cash flows from operating activities excluding the impact of asu 201615 and related interpretive guidance for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 management believes this nongaap financial measure is relevant and meaningful as it presents cash flows from operating activities inclusive of all trade accounts receivable collection activity which the company utilizes in support of its operating activities 



free cash flow 

the company defines free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures under this definition free cash flow represents the cash that remains available to the company after investing in its asset base to fund obligations using the companys primary source of incremental liquidity  cash provided by operating activities free cash flow is an integral financial measure used in the companys financial planning process this financial measure is not recognized in accordance with us gaap and should not be viewed as an alternative to us gaap financial measures of performance all companies do not calculate nongaap financial measures in the same manner and accordingly the companys free cash flow definition may not be consistent with the methodologies used by other companies 

for further information relating to the change in cash provided by used for operating activities see the discussion above under the section entitled cash flows from operating activities 



 

liquidity  financial flexibility 

the company’s primary source of incremental liquidity is cash flows from operating activities management expects the generation of cash from operations and the ability to access the debt capital markets and other sources of liquidity will continue to provide sufficient liquidity and financial flexibility to meet the companys and its subsidiaries obligations as they come due

environmental matters 

accruals for environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated at december 31 2018  the company had accrued obligations of 1201 million  for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs including 210 million  for the remediation of superfund sites as remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site it is difficult to develop precise estimates of future site remediation costs the companys estimates are based on a number of factors including the complexity of the geology the nature and extent of contamination the type of remedy the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties prps at multiparty sites and the number of and financial viability of other prps therefore considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation and costs and under adverse changes in circumstances it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to two and a half times   above that amount consequently it is reasonably possible that environmental remediation and restoration costs in excess of amounts accrued could have a material impact on the company’s results of operations financial condition and cash flows it is the opinion of the company’s management however that the possibility is remote that costs in excess of the range disclosed will have a material impact on the company’s

goodwill 

the company performs goodwill impairment testing at the reporting unit level which is defined as the operating segment or one level below the operating segment one level below the operating segment or component is a business in which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management the company aggregates certain components into reporting units based on economic similarities the operating segment is the reporting unit for agriculture electronics  imaging nutrition  health and transportation  advanced polymers operating segments the company tests goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit has declined below its carrying value goodwill is evaluated for impairment using qualitative andor quantitative testing procedures at december 31 2018  the company had defined 9 operating segments and 15 reporting units goodwill was carried by 14 of these reporting units 

the company has the option to first perform qualitative testing to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value qualitative factors assessed at the company level include but are not limited to gdp growth rates longterm hydrocarbon and energy prices equity and credit market activity discount rates foreign exchange rates and overall financial performance qualitative factors assessed at the reporting unit level include but are not limited to changes in industry and market structure competitive environments planned capacity and new product launches cost factors such as raw material prices and financial performance of the reporting unit if the company chooses not to complete a qualitative assessment for a given reporting unit or if the initial assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value additional quantitative testing is required 

quantitative testing requires the fair value of the reporting unit to be compared with its carrying value if the reporting units carrying value exceeds its fair value an impairment charge is recognized for the difference the company utilizes a discounted cash flow methodology to calculate the fair value of its reporting units this valuation technique has been selected by management as the most meaningful valuation method due to the limited number of market comparables for the companys reporting units however where market comparables are available the company includes ebitebitda multiples as part of the reporting unit valuation analysis the discounted cash flow valuations are completed using the following key assumptions projected revenue growth rates or compounded annual growth rates over a five to tenyear cash flow forecast period which varied by reporting unit based on underlying business fundamentals and future expectations discount rates tax rates terminal values differentiated based on the cash flow projection of each reporting unit and the projected net operating profit after tax nopat growth rate currency exchange rates and forecasted longterm hydrocarbon and energy prices by geographic region and by year which included the companys key feedstocks as well as natural gas and crude oil due to its correlation to naphtha these key assumptions are determined through evaluation of the company as a whole and underlying business fundamentals and industry risk 

the company also monitors and evaluates its market capitalization relative to book value when the market capitalization of the company falls below book value management undertakes a process to evaluate whether a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of its reporting units has declined below carrying value this evaluation process includes the use of thirdparty marketbased valuations and internal discounted cash flow analysis 

2018  interim goodwill impairment testing 

as a result of the merger and the related acquisition method of accounting historical dupont’s assets and liabilities were measured at fair value and any declines in financial projections could have a material negative impact on the fair value of the company’s reporting units and assets particularly within the agriculture and specialty products divisions and therefore could result in an impairment 

  

the company commenced strategic business reviews during the third quarter of 2018 inclusive of assembling updated financial projections in connection with these strategic business reviews and the update to financial projections dowdupont’s subsidiary historical dupont a separate sec registrant was required to perform an interim test of goodwill for its agriculture reporting unit as a result of the analysis performed historical dupont recorded a pretax noncash goodwill impairment charge of 45 billion however the impairment charge did not survive at the dowdupont level the agriculture operating segment was determined to be the reporting unit for dowdupont which includes the operations of the agriculture reporting units of both historical dupont and historical dow as a result of the merger accounting considerations and the differences in the composition in the carrying value of the agriculture reporting unit of historical dupont assets and liabilities measured at fair value and the combined agriculture reporting unit of dowdupont excess fair value over carrying value associated with the historical dow business is retained the fair value of the combined agriculture reporting unit of dowdupont exceeded its carrying value by more than 10 percent and therefore no goodwill impairment existed for dowdupont 

2018  annual goodwill impairment testing 

in the f ourth  quarter of 2018 quantitative testing was performed on four  reporting units and a qualitative assessment was performed on the remaining reporting units that carry goodwill for the qualitative assessments management considered the factors at both the company level and the reporting unit level based on the qualitative assessments management concluded it is not more likely than not that the fair values of the reporting units were less than the carrying values of the reporting units 

upon completion of quantitative testing in the fourth quarter of 2018 the company determined the fair value of these reporting units exceeded the carrying value of the reporting units two of these reporting units industrial biosciences and clean technologies are comprised of historical dupont assets and liabilities only due to the fair value and carrying value of these two reporting units being equal at the date of the merger resulting in little margin of fair value in excess of carrying value the company believes these reporting units are at risk to have impairment charges in future periods changes in factors circumstances and key assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments as well as the time in which such impairments are recognized the carrying amount of goodwill for the industrial biosciences and clean technologies reporting units at december 31 2018 was 3113 million  and 461 million  respectively 

pension and other postretirement benefits 

the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets discount rates at which the liabilities could have been settled at december 31 2018  rate of increase in future compensation levels mortality rates and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods the us pension plans represent the majority of historical dow and historical dupont’s pension plan assets and pension obligations 

historical dow uses the spot rate approach to determine the discount rate utilized to measure the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs for the us and other selected countries historical dupont also uses the spot rate approach for its us plans under the spot rate approach historical dow and historical dupont calculate service costs and interest costs by applying individual spot rates from a yield curve based on highquality corporate bond yields for each selected country to the separate expected cash flow components of service cost and interest cost service cost and interest cost for all other plans are determined on the basis of the single equivalent discount rates derived in determining those plan obligations 

the following information relates to historical dow and historical duponts us plans only a similar approach is used for historical dow and historical duponts nonus plans 

historical dow and historical dupont determine the expected longterm rate of return on assets by performing a detailed analysis of historical and expected returns based on the strategic asset allocation and the underlying return fundamentals of each asset class the historical experience of the pension fund asset performance is also considered the expected return of each asset class is derived from a forecasted future return confirmed by historical experience the expected longterm rate of return is an assumption and not what is expected to be earned in any one particular year the weightedaverage longterm rate of return assumption used for determining net periodic pension expense for 2018  was 708  percent the weightedaverage assumption to be used for determining 2019  net periodic pension expense is 710  percent future actual pension expense will depend on future investment performance changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the population of participants in the company’s pension plans 

the discount rates utilized to measure the pension and other postretirement obligations of the us plans are based on the yield on highquality corporate fixed income investments at the measurement date future expected actuarially determined cash flows are individually discounted at spot rates under the willis towers watson us ratelink 6090 corporate yield curve for historical dows plans and under the aon aaabove median yield curve for historical duponts plans to arrive at the plans obligations as of the measurement date the weighted average discount rate utilized to measure pension obligations increased to 436  percent at december 31 2018  from 366  percent at december 31 2017  

the assumption for the longterm rate of increase in compensation levels for the historical dow us plans was 425  percent as of november 30 2018 active employees who participate in historical duponts us pension plans no longer accrue additional benefits for future service and eligible compensation historical dow and historical dupont use generational mortality tables to value their us pension and other postretirement obligations 

the following discussion relates to historical dows significant pension plans and historical duponts us qualified plan 

historical dow and historical dupont base the determination of pension expense on a marketrelated valuation of plan assets that reduces yeartoyear volatility for historical dow this marketrelated valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur for historical dupont the marketrelated value of assets is calculated by averaging market returns over 36 months as a result changes in the fair value of assets are not immediately reflected in the company’s calculation of net periodic pension cost over the life of the plans both gains and losses have been recognized and amortized at december 31 2018  net losses of 2365 million  remain to be recognized in the calculation of the marketrelated value of plan assets these net losses will result in increases in future pension expense as they are recognized in the marketrelated value of assets 

the net decrease in the marketrelated value of assets due to the recognition of prior losses is presented in the following table 



the company expects pension expense to decrease in 2019  by approximately 100 million  the decrease in pension expense is primarily the result of higher discount rates and the full year impact of discretionary contributions of 1100 million  made to each of historical dows and historical duponts principal us pension plans in the third quarter of 2018 

a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the longterm return on assets assumption would change the company’s total pension expense for 2019  by 106 million  a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate assumption would lower the companys total pension expense for 2019  by 24 million  a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase the companys total pension expense for 2019  by 33 million  a 25 basis point change in the longterm return and discount rate assumptions would have an immaterial impact on the other postretirement benefit expense for 2019  

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse based on the evaluation of available evidence both positive and negative the company recognizes future tax benefits such as net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered to be more likely than not 

at december 31 2018  the company had a net deferred tax liability balance of 3711 million  after valuation allowances of 2407 million  

in evaluating the ability to realize the deferred tax assets the company relies on in order of increasing subjectivity taxable income in prior carryback years the future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences tax planning strategies and forecasted taxable income using historical and projected future operating results 

at december 31 2018  the company had deferred tax assets for tax loss and tax credit carryforwards of 3634 million  384 million  of which is subject to expiration in the years 2019  through 2023  

the company recognizes the financial statement effects of an uncertain income tax position when it is more likely than not based on technical merits that the position will be sustained upon examination at december 31 2018  the company had uncertain tax positions for both domestic and foreign issues of 1062 million  

indemnification assets 

on july 1 2015 historical dupont completed the separation of its performance chemicals segment through the spinoff of all of the issued and outstanding stock of the chemours company the chemours separation in connection with the chemours separation historical dupont and the chemours company chemours entered into a separation agreement as amended the chemours separation agreement pursuant to the chemours separation agreement discussed in note 16  to the consolidated financial statements historical dupont is indemnified by chemours against certain litigation environmental workers compensation and other liabilities that arose prior to the chemours separation the term of this indemnification is indefinite and 

includes defense costs and expenses as well as monetary and nonmonetary settlements and judgments in connection with the recognition of liabilities related to these indemnified matters historical dupont records an indemnification asset when recovery is deemed probable in assessing the probability of recovery historical dupont considers the contractual rights under the chemours separation agreement and any potential credit risk future events such as potential disputes related to recovery as well as the solvency of chemours could cause the indemnification assets to have a lower value than anticipated and recorded the company evaluates the recovery of the indemnification assets recorded when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be fully recoverable 

purchase accounting 

due to the merger and the related accounting determination historical dupont’s assets and liabilities were measured at fair value as of the date of the merger estimates of fair value require a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties in determining the fair value dowdupont utilized various forms of the income cost and market approaches depending on the asset or liability being fair valued the estimation of fair value required significant judgments related to future net cash flows including net sales cost of products sold selling and marketing costs and working capitalcontributory asset charges discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in each cash flow stream competitive trends market comparables and other factors inputs were generally determined by taking into account historical data supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions and growth rates the estimates and assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets and liabilities as well as asset lives have a material impact to the companys consolidated financial statements and are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain third party valuation specialists were engaged to assist in the valuation of certain of these assets and liabilities the valuation process to determine the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities is complete 

prepaid royalties 

the company’s agriculture segment currently has certain thirdparty biotechnology trait license agreements which require upfront and variable payments subject to the licensor meeting certain conditions these payments are reflected as “other current assets” and “deferred charges and other assets” in the consolidated balance sheets and are amortized to “cost of sales” in the consolidated statements of income as seeds containing the respective trait technology are utilized over the life of the license at december 31 2018 the balance of prepaid royalties reflected in “other current assets” and “deferred charges and other assets” was 239 million and 1139 million respectively the company evaluates the carrying value of the prepaid royalties when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable the recoverability of the prepaid royalties and the rate of royalty amortization expense recognized are based on the company’s strategic plans which include various assumptions and estimates including product portfolio market dynamics farmer preferences growth rates and projected planted acres changes in factors and assumptions included in the strategic plans including potential changes to the product portfolio in favor of internally developed biotechnology could impact the recoverability andor rate of recognition of the relevant prepaid royalty

climate change  historical dow 

climate change matters for historical dow are likely to be driven by changes in regulations public policy and physical climate parameters 

regulatory matters 

regulatory matters include cap and trade schemes increased greenhouse gas “ghg” limits and taxes on ghg emissions fuel and energy the potential implications of each of these matters are all very similar including increased costs of purchased energy additional capital costs for installation or modification of ghg emitting equipment and additional costs associated directly with ghg emissions such as cap and trade systems or carbon taxes which are primarily related to energy use it is difficult to estimate the potential impact of these regulatory matters on energy prices 

reducing historical dows overall energy usage and ghg emissions through new and unfolding projects will decrease the potential impact of these regulatory matters historical dow also has a dedicated commercial group to handle energy contracts and purchases including managing emissions trading historical dow has not experienced any material impact related to regulated ghg emissions and continues to evaluate and monitor this area for future developments 

physical climate parameters 

many scientific academies throughout the world have concluded that it is very likely that human activities are contributing to global warming at this point it is difficult to predict and assess the probability and opportunity of a global warming trend on historical dow specifically preparedness plans are developed that detail actions needed in the event of severe weather these measures have historically been in place and these activities and associated costs are driven by normal operational preparedness historical dow continues to study the longterm implications of changing climate parameters on water availability plant siting issues and impacts and opportunities for products 

historical dow’s energy business and public affairs and sustainability functions are tasked with developing and implementing a comprehensive strategy that addresses the potential challenges of energy security and ghg emissions historical dow continues to elevate its internal focus and external positions  to focus on the root causes of ghg emissions  including the unsustainable use of energy historical dows energy plan provides the roadmap 



 

through corporate energy efficiency programs and focused ghg management efforts historical dow has and is continuing to reduce its ghg emissions footprint historical dow’s manufacturing intensity measured in btu per pound of product has improved by more than 40 percent since 1990 as part of its 2025 sustainability goals historical dow will maintain ghg emissions below 2006 levels on an absolute basis for all ghgs 

historical dow intends to implement the recommendations of the financial stability boards task force on climaterelated disclosures task force over the next two to four years which is aligned with the recommendations of the task force

historical dupont believes that climate change is an important global issue that presents risks and opportunities for instance historical dupont continuously evaluates opportunities for existing and new product and service offerings to meet the anticipated demands of a lowcarbon economy historical dupont also manages and reports its operational resource efficiency expanding upon significant ghg emissions and other environmental footprint reductions made in the period 19902010 in 2015 historical dupont announced its 2020 sustainability goals including a goal to achieve a 7 percent reduction in ghg emissions intensity 2015 baseline and a 10 percent improvement in energy intensity 2010 baseline while historical duponts 2017 ghg intensity held relatively flat with its 2015 goal baseline historical dupont has achieved a 127 percent reduction in ghg intensity since 2010 in addition historical dupont has achieved a 149 percent improvement in nonrenewable energy intensity since 2010 

historical dupont is actively engaged in efforts to develop constructive public policies to reduce ghg emissions and encourage lowercarbon forms of energy such policies may bring higher operating costs as well as greater revenue and margin opportunities legislative efforts to control or limit ghg emissions could affect historical duponts energy source and supply choices as well as increase the cost of energy and raw materials derived from fossil fuels such efforts are also anticipated to provide the business community with greater certainty for the regulatory future help guide investment decisions and drive growth in demand for lowcarbon and energyefficient products technologies and services similarly demand is expected to grow for products that facilitate adaptation to a changing climate however the current unsettled policy environment in the us where many historical dupont facilities are located adds an element of uncertainty to business decisions particularly those relating to longterm capital investments 

in addition significant differences in regional or national approaches could present challenges in a global marketplace an effective global climate policy framework will help drive the market changes that are needed to stimulate and efficiently deploy new innovations in science and technology while maintaining open and competitive global markets 

dowdupont environmental remediation   

environmental capital expenditures 

capital expenditures for environmental projects either required by law or necessary to meet the company’s internal environmental goals were 105 million  in 2018  

environmental operating costs and remediation 

as a result of the historical dow and historical dupont operations dowdupont incurs environmental operating costs for pollution abatement activities including waste collection and disposal installation and maintenance of air pollution controls and wastewater treatment emissions testing and monitoring and obtaining permits the company also incurs environmental operating costs related to environmental related research and development activities including environmental field and treatment studies as well as toxicity and degradation testing to evaluate the environmental impact of products and raw materials 

pretax environmental expenses charged to income from continuing operations are summarized below 



 

based on existing facts and circumstances management does not believe that year over year changes in environmental expenses charged to current operations will have a material impact on the companys financial position liquidity or results of operations 

annual expenditures in the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures experienced in the past few years longer term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly 

changes in the remediation accrual balance are summarized below 



 

considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation and costs and under adverse changes in circumstances it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to two and a half times  times above the amount accrued consequently it is reasonably possible that environmental remediation and restoration costs in excess of amounts accrued could have a material impact on the company’s results of operations financial condition and cash flows it is the opinion of the company’s management however that the possibility is remote that costs in excess of the range disclosed will have a material impact on the company’s results of operations financial condition or cash flows for further discussion see environmental matters in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and notes 1 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

information regarding environmental sites is provided below 



 

additional information is provided below for historical dow’s midland michigan manufacturing site and midland offsite locations collectively the midland sites as well as a superfund site in woodridge new jersey the locations for historical dow that have the largest potential environmental liabilities 

in the early days of operations at the historical dow midland manufacturing site wastes were usually disposed of onsite resulting in soil and groundwater contamination which has been contained and managed onsite under a series of resource conservation and recovery act permits and regulatory agreements the hazardous waste operating license for the midland manufacturing 

site issued in 2003 and renewed and replaced in september 2015 also included provisions for historical dow to conduct an investigation to determine the nature and extent of offsite contamination from historic midland manufacturing site operations in january 2010 historical dow the epa and the state of michigan state entered into an administrative order on consent that requires historical dow to conduct a remedial investigation a feasibility study and a remedial design for the tittabawassee river the saginaw river and the saginaw bay and pay the oversight costs of the epa and the state under the authority of the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act see note 16  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information at december 31 2018  historical dow had an accrual of 134 million   131 million  at december 31 2017  for environmental remediation and investigation associated with the midland sites in 2018  historical dow spent 26 million   24 million  in 2017  for environmental remediation at the midland sites 

rohm and haas a wholly owned subsidiary of historical dow is a prp at the woodridge new jersey ventronvelsicol superfund site and the adjacent berry’s creek study area bcsa collectively the woodridge sites rohm and haas is a successor in interest to a company that owned and operated a mercury processing facility where wastewater and waste handling resulted in contamination of soils and adjacent creek sediments the berry’s creek study area prp group completed a multistage remedial investigation ri pursuant to an administrative order on consent with us epa region 2 to identify contamination in surface water sediment and biota related to numerous contaminated sites in the berrys creek watershed and submitted the report to the epa in june 2016 that same month the epa concluded that an iterative or adaptive approach was appropriate for cleaning up the bcsa thus each phase of remediation will be followed by a period of monitoring to assess its effectiveness and determine if there is a need for more work the feasibility study fs for the first phase of work was submitted in the third quarter of 2018 the epa selected the interim remedy and issued an interim record of decision rod the prp group is negotiating agreements among the prps to fund design of the selected remedy and with the epa to design the selected remedy although there is currently much uncertainty as to what will ultimately be required to remediate the bcsa and rohm and haass share of these costs has yet to be determined the range of activities that will be required in the interim rod is known in general terms based on the interim remedy selected by the epa the overall remediation accrual for the woodridge sites was increased by 21 million  in the fourth quarter of 2018 at december 31 2018  the company had an accrual of 106 million   88 million  at december 31 2017  for environmental remediation at the woodridge sites in 2018  historical dow spent 6 million   7 million  in 2017  on environmental remediation at the woodridge sites 

in the fourth quarter of 2016 historical dow recorded a pretax charge of 295 million  for environmental remediation at a number of historical locations including the midland manufacturing siteoffsite matters and the woodridge sites primarily resulting from the culmination of negotiations with regulators andor final agency approval this charge was included in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of income in total the company’s accrued liability for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs was 1201 million  at december 31 2018  compared with 1311 million  at december 31 2017  this is management’s best estimate of the costs for remediation and restoration with respect to environmental matters for which the company has accrued liabilities although it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to approximately two and a half times that amount consequently it is reasonably possible that environmental remediation and restoration costs in excess of amounts accrued could have a material impact on the company’s results of operations financial condition and cash flows it is the opinion of the company’s management however that the possibility is remote that costs in excess of the range disclosed will have a material impact on the company’s results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

separation of historical duponts performance chemicals segment 

pursuant to the chemours separation agreement discussed in note 16  to the consolidated financial statements historical dupont is indemnified by chemours for certain environmental matters included in the liability of 1201 million  that had an estimated liability of 193 million  at december 31 2018  and a potential exposure that ranges up to approximately 310 million  above the current accrual as such historical dupont has recorded an indemnification asset of 193 million  corresponding to historical duponts accrual balance related to these matters at december 31 2018  

asbestosrelated matters of union carbide corporation 

union carbide is and has been involved in a large number of asbestosrelated suits filed primarily in state courts during the past four decades these suits principally allege personal injury resulting from exposure to asbestoscontaining products and frequently seek both actual and punitive damages the alleged claims primarily relate to products that union carbide sold in the past alleged exposure to asbestoscontaining products located on union carbide’s premises and union carbide’s responsibility for asbestos suits filed against a former union carbide subsidiary amchem in many cases plaintiffs are unable to demonstrate that they have suffered any compensable loss as a result of such exposure or that injuries incurred in fact resulted from exposure to union carbide’s products 

the table below provides information regarding asbestosrelated claims pending against union carbide and amchem based on criteria developed by union carbide and its external consultants 



plaintiffs’ lawyers often sue numerous defendants in individual lawsuits or on behalf of numerous claimants as a result the damages alleged are not expressly identified as to union carbide amchem or any other particular defendant even when specific damages are alleged with respect to a specific disease or injury in fact there are no personal injury cases in which only union carbide andor amchem are the sole named defendants for these reasons and based upon union carbide’s litigation and settlement experience union carbide does not consider the damages alleged against union carbide and amchem to be a meaningful factor in its determination of any potential asbestosrelated liability 

for additional information see part i item 3 legal proceedings and asbestosrelated matters of union carbide corporation and note 16  to the consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

dowduponts risk management programs are managed separately by historical dow and historical dupont historical dow and historical dupont have historically utilized different methods to report their quantitative information about market risk historical dow uses a valueatrisk var approach while historical dupont uses sensitivity analysis both methods are acceptable under sec regulation sk and are viewed as equally effective from a risk monitoring perspective as the risk management programs for historical dow and historical dupont will continue to be managed separately the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk will be provided for each subsidiary as discussed below 

historical dow 

historical dow’s business operations give rise to market risk exposure due to changes in foreign exchange rates interest rates commodity prices and other market factors such as equity prices to manage such risks effectively historical dow enters into hedging transactions pursuant to established guidelines and policies that enable it to mitigate the adverse effects of financial market risk derivatives used for this purpose are designated as hedges per the accounting guidance related to derivatives and hedging activities where appropriate a secondary objective is to add value by creating additional nonspecific exposure within established limits and policies derivatives used for this purpose are not designated as hedges the potential impact of creating such additional exposures is not material to historical dow’s results 

the global nature of historical dow’s business requires active participation in the foreign exchange markets historical dow has assets liabilities and cash flows in currencies other than the us dollar the primary objective of historical dow’s foreign currency risk management is to optimize the us dollar value of net assets and cash flows to achieve this objective historical dow hedges on a net exposure basis using foreign currency forward contracts overthecounter option contracts crosscurrency swaps and nonderivative instruments in foreign currencies exposures primarily relate to assets liabilities and bonds denominated in foreign currencies as well as economic exposure which is derived from the risk that currency fluctuations could affect the dollar value of future cash flows related to operating activities the largest exposures are denominated in european currencies the japanese yen and the chinese yuan although exposures also exist in other currencies of asia pacific canada latin america middle east africa and india 

the main objective of interest rate risk management is to reduce the total funding cost to historical dow and to alter the interest rate exposure to the desired risk profile to achieve this objective historical dow hedges using interest rate swaps “swaptions” and exchangetraded instruments historical dow’s primary exposure is to the us dollar yield curve 

historical dow has a portfolio of equity securities derived primarily from the investment activities of its insurance subsidiaries this exposure is managed in a manner consistent with historical dow’s market risk policies and procedures 

inherent in historical dow’s business is exposure to price changes for several commodities some exposures can be hedged effectively through liquid tradable financial instruments natural gas and crude oil along with feedstocks for ethylene and propylene production constitute the main commodity exposures overthecounter and exchange traded instruments are used to hedge these risks when feasible 

historical dow uses var stress testing and scenario analysis for risk measurement and control purposes var estimates the maximum potential loss in fair market values given a certain move in prices over a certain period of time using specified confidence levels the var methodology used by historical dow is a variancecovariance model this model uses a 975 percent confidence level and includes at least one year of historical data the 2018  and 2017  yearend and average daily var for the aggregate of all positions are shown below these amounts are immaterial relative to the total equity of historical dow 



historical dow’s daily var for the aggregate of all positions increased from a composite var of 132 million at december 31 2017  to a composite var of 145 million at december 31 2018  the interest rate var increased due to an increase in exposure the equity securities var increased due to an increase in managed exposures and higher equity volatility the commodities var decreased due to a decrease in managed exposure see note 21  to the consolidated financial statements for further disclosure regarding market risk 

historical dupont   

historical dupont’s global operations are exposed to financial market risks relating to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates historical dupont has established a variety of programs including the use of derivative instruments and other financial instruments to manage the exposure to financial market risks as to minimize volatility of financial results in the ordinary course of business historical dupont enters into derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign currency interest rate and commodity price risks under established procedures and controls decisions regarding whether or not to hedge a given commitment are made on a casebycase basis taking into consideration the amount and duration of the exposure market volatility and economic trends foreign currency exchange contracts are also used from time to time to manage nearterm foreign currency cash requirements 

foreign currency exchange rate risks 

historical dupont has significant international operations resulting in a large number of currency transactions that result from international sales purchases investments and borrowings the primary currencies for which historical dupont has an exchange rate exposure are the european euro chinese yuan brazilian real and japanese yen historical dupont uses forward exchange contracts to offset its net exposures by currency related to the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities of its operations in addition to the contracts disclosed in note 21  to the consolidated financial statements from time to time historical dupont will enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to establish with certainty the us dollar amount of future firm commitments denominated in a foreign currency 

the following table illustrates the fair values of outstanding foreign currency contracts at december 31 2018  and the effect on fair values of a hypothetical adverse change in the foreign exchange rates that existed at december 31 2018  the sensitivities for foreign currency contracts are based on a 10 percent adverse change in foreign exchange rates 



since historical duponts risk management programs are highly effective the potential loss in value for each risk management portfolio described above would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure 

concentration of credit risk 

historical dupont maintains cash and cash equivalents marketable securities derivatives and certain other financial instruments with various financial institutions these financial institutions are generally highly rated and geographically dispersed and historical dupont has a policy to limit the dollar amount of credit exposure with any one institution 

as part of historical duponts financial risk management processes it continuously evaluates the relative credit standing of all of the financial institutions that service historical dupont and monitors actual exposures versus established limits historical dupont has not sustained credit losses from instruments held at financial institutions

executive officers of the registrant 

set forth below is information related to the companys executive officers as of february 15 2018 






 item 1a risk factors 

the factors described below represent the companys principal risks 

dowdupont may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger combining the businesses of dupont and dow may be more difficult costly or timeconsuming than expected which may adversely affect dowduponts results and negatively affect the value of dowdupont common stock 

the success of the merger depends on among other things dowduponts ability to combine the dupont and dow businesses in a manner that facilitates the intended separation of the companys agriculture materials science and specialty products businesses through one or more taxefficient transactions the intended business separations resulting in three independent publicly traded companies and realizes anticipated synergies 

dowdupont expects to benefit from significant cost synergies at both the business and corporate levels through the dowdupont cost synergy program the synergy program which is designed to integrate and optimize the organization following the merger and in preparation for the intended business separations including through the achievement of production cost efficiencies enhancement of the agricultural supply chain elimination of duplicative agricultural research and development programs optimization of the combined company’s global footprint across manufacturing sales and research and development optimizing manufacturing processes in the electronics space the reduction of corporate and leveraged services costs and the realization of significant procurement synergies in connection with the synergy program dowdupont expects to record total pretax restructuring charges of approximately 2 billion  comprised of approximately 845 million  to 935 million  of severance and related benefit costs 400 million  to 540 million  of asset writedowns and writeoffs and 400 million  to 450 million  of costs associated with exit and disposal activities 

management also expects the combined company will achieve growth synergies and other meaningful savings and benefits as a result of the intended business separations 

combining dupont and dows independent businesses and preparing for the intended business separations are complex costly and timeconsuming processes and the management of dowdupont may face significant implementation challenges many of which may be beyond the control of management including without limitation 

 

some of these factors will be outside of the control of dowdupont and any one of them could result in increased costs and diversion of management’s time and energy as well as decreases in the amount of expected revenue which could materially impact dowduponts business financial condition and results of operations the integration and intended businesses separation processes and other disruptions including those from divestitures and acquisitions undertaken in connection with securing regulatory approval for the merger as well as those from the portfolio changes between the materials science and specialty products businesses may also adversely affect the combined company’s relationships with employees suppliers customers distributors licensors and others with whom dupont and dow have business or other dealings and difficulties in integrating the businesses or regulatory functions of dupont and dow could harm the reputation of dowdupont 

if dowdupont is not able to successfully combine the businesses of dupont and dow in an efficient costeffective and timely manner the anticipated benefits and cost savings including from the synergy program of the merger including the intended business separations may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected and the value of dowdupont common stock the revenues levels of expenses and results of operations may be affected adversely a variety of factors may 

adversely affect the companys ability to realize the currently expected synergies savings and other benefits of the merger including failure to successfully optimize the combined companys facilities footprint the failure to take advantage of the combined companys global supply chain the failure to identify and eliminate duplicative programs and the failure to otherwise integrate duponts or dows respective businesses including their technology platforms 

the determination to proceed with the intended business separations is a decision of the dowdupont board of directors and the expected benefits of such transactions if they occur will be uncertain 

in the event that the dowdupont board determines to proceed with the intended business separations it is currently anticipated that any such intended business separation transaction would be effectuated through two prorata spinoff transactions in which dowdupont stockholders at such time would receive shares of capital stock in the resulting spinoff companies resulting in three independent public companies the dowdupont board may ultimately determine to abandon one or more of the intended business separation transactions and such determination could have an adverse impact on dowdupont there are many factors that could prior to the determination by the dowdupont board to proceed with the intended business separations impact the structure or timing of the anticipated benefits from or determination to ultimately proceed with the intended business separations including among others global economic conditions instability in credit markets declining consumer and business confidence fluctuating commodity prices and interest rates volatile foreign currency exchange rates tax considerations and other challenges that could affect the global economy specific market conditions in one or more of the industries of the businesses proposed to be separated and changes in the regulatory or legal environment such changes could adversely impact the value of one or more of the intended business separation transactions to the combined company’s stockholders additionally to the extent the dowdupont board determines to proceed with the intended business separations the consummation of such transactions is a complex costly and timeconsuming process and there can be no guarantee that the intended benefits of such transactions will be achieved an inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the intended business separations as well as any delays encountered in the process could have an adverse effect upon the revenues level of expenses and operating results of the agriculture business the specialty products business the materials science business andor the combined company 

dowdupont will incur significant costs in connection with the integration of dupont and dow and the intended business separations 

there are a large number of processes policies procedures operations technologies and systems that must be integrated in connection with the merger and replicated transferred or separated in connection with the intended business separations while dowdupont has assumed a certain level of expenses including in connection with the synergy program would be incurred in connection with the merger and the intended business separations there are many factors beyond the combined company’s control that could affect the total amount of or the timing of anticipated expenses with respect to the integration and implementation of the combined businesses 

there may also be additional unanticipated significant costs in connection with the merger and the intended business separations that dowdupont may not recoup these costs and expenses could reduce the benefits and additional income dowdupont expects to achieve from the merger although dowdupont expects that these benefits will offset the transaction expenses and implementation costs over time this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all 

inability to access the debt capital markets could impair dowduponts liquidity business or financial condition 

dowdupont’s primary sources of liquidity are through dupont and dow and their respective consolidated subsidiaries collectively the “subsidiaries” each of dupont and dow has relied and continues to rely on access to the debt capital markets to finance their daytoday and longterm operations in connection with the merger dowdupont has not incurred debt obligations or guaranteed the debt obligations of dupont or dow any limitation on the part of either dupont’s or dow’s ability to raise money in the debt markets could have a substantial negative effect on their respective liquidity and the liquidity of dowdupont access to the debt capital markets in amounts adequate to finance each subsidiary’s activities could be impaired as a result of the existence of material nonpublic information about the intended business separations and other potential factors including factors that are not specific to the subsidiaries such as a severe disruption of the financial markets and interest rate fluctuations 

prior to the intended business separations if pursued the level and quality of the respective earnings operations business and management among other things of each of dupont and dow will impact their respective credit ratings costs and availability of financing and those of the combined company a decrease in the ratings assigned to dupont or dow by the ratings agencies may negatively impact their access to the debt capital markets and increase the combined company’s cost of borrowing there can be no assurance that dupont and dow will maintain their current credit worthiness or prospective credit ratings any actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in such credit ratings may have a negative impact on the liquidity capital position or access to capital markets of dupont and dow and therefore dowdupont 

dowdupont will be exposed to the risks related to international sales and operations 

dupont and dow each derive a large portion of their total sales and revenues from operations outside of the united states therefore dowdupont will have exposure to risks of operating in many foreign countries including 

 

any one or more of the above factors could adversely affect the international operations of the combined company and could significantly affect the combined company’s results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

availability of purchased feedstocks and energy and the volatility of these costs impact the companys operating costs and add variability to earnings 

primarily in support of its materials science businesses the company purchases hydrocarbon raw materials including ethane propane butane naphtha and condensate as feedstocks the company also purchases certain monomers primarily ethylene and propylene to supplement internal production as well as other raw materials the company purchases natural gas primarily to generate electricity and purchases electric power to supplement internal generation 

feedstock and energy costs generally follow price trends in crude oil and natural gas which are sometimes volatile while the company uses its feedstock flexibility and financial and physical hedging programs to help mitigate feedstock cost increases the company is not always able to immediately raise selling prices ultimately the ability to pass on underlying cost increases is dependent on market conditions conversely when feedstock and energy costs decline selling prices generally decline as well as a result volatility in these costs could impact the company’s results of operations 

the company has a number of investments in the us gulf coast to take advantage of increasing supplies of lowcost natural gas and ngls derived from shale gas including the restart of the sco2 ethylene production facility in december 2012 construction of a new onpurpose propylene production facility which commenced operations in december 2015 completion of a major maintenance turnaround in december 2016 at an ethylene production facility in plaquemine louisiana which included expanding the facility’s ethylene production capacity by up to 250 kta and modifications to enable full ethane cracking flexibility and construction of a new worldscale ethylene production facility in freeport texas which commenced operations in the third quarter of 2017 and a capacity expansion project which will bring the facilitys total ethylene capacity to 2000 kta as a result of these investments the companys exposure to purchased ethylene and propylene is expected to decline offset by increased exposure to ethane and propanebased feedstocks 

while the company expects abundant and costadvantaged supplies of ngls in the united states to persist for the foreseeable future if ngls were to become significantly less advantaged than crude oilbased feedstocks it could have a negative impact on the company’s results of operations and future investments also if the company’s key suppliers of feedstocks and energy are unable to provide the raw materials required for production it could have a negative impact on the companys results of operations 

earnings generated by the companys products vary based in part on the balance of supply relative to demand within the industry 

the balance of supply relative to demand within the industry may be significantly impacted by the addition of new capacity especially for basic commodities where capacity is generally added in large increments as worldscale facilities are built this may disrupt industry balances and result in downward pressure on prices due to the increase in supply which could negatively impact the companys results of operations 

the costs of complying with evolving regulatory requirements could negatively impact the companys financial results actual or alleged violations of environmental laws or permit requirements could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations substantial civil or criminal sanctions as well as the assessment of strict liability andor joint and several liability 

the company is subject to extensive federal state local and foreign laws regulations rules and ordinances relating to pollution protection of the environment greenhouse gas emissions and the generation storage handling transportation treatment disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials costs and capital expenditures relating to environmental health or safety matters are subject to evolving regulatory requirements and depend on the timing of the promulgation and enforcement of specific standards which impose the requirements moreover changes in environmental regulations could inhibit or interrupt the companys operations or require modifications to its facilities accordingly environmental health or safety regulatory matters could result in significant unanticipated costs or liabilities 

increased concerns regarding the safe use of seeds with biotechnology traits crop protection products and chemicals in commerce and their potential impact on the environment as well as perceived impacts of biotechnology on health and the environment have resulted in more restrictive regulations and could lead to new regulations 

concerns and claims regarding the safe use of seeds with biotechnology traits crop protection products and chemicals their potential impact on health and the environment and the perceived impacts of biotechnology on health and the environment reflect a growing trend in societal demands for increasing levels of product safety and environmental protection these concerns and claims include those that increased use of crop protection products related drift and volatilization and of biotechnology traits to address resistance of weeds and pests to control by crop protection products could increase such resistance and otherwise negatively impact health and the environment these concerns could manifest themselves in stockholder proposals preferred purchasing delays or failures in obtaining or retaining regulatory approvals delayed product launches lack of market acceptance product discontinuation continued pressure for and adoption of more stringent regulatory intervention and litigation these concerns could also influence public perceptions the viability or continued sales of certain of the companys products the companys reputation and the cost to comply with regulations these concerns could have a negative impact on the companys results of operations 

in most jurisdictions the company must test the safety efficacy and environmental impact of its agricultural products to satisfy regulatory requirements and obtain the necessary approvals in certain jurisdictions the company must periodically renew its approvals which may require it to demonstrate compliance with thencurrent standards the regulatory environment is lengthy complex and in some markets unpredictable with requirements that can vary by product technology industry and country the regulatory environment may be impacted by the activities of nongovernmental organizations and special interest groups and stakeholder reaction to actual or perceived impacts of new technology products or processes on safety health and the environment obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals requires submitting a significant amount of information and data which may require participation from technology providers regulatory standards and trial procedures are continuously changing the pace of change together with the lack of regulatory harmony could result in unintended noncompliance 

responding to these changes and meeting existing and new requirements may involve significant costs or capital expenditures or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced profitability the failure to receive necessary permits or approvals could have near and longterm effects on the company’s ability to produce and sell some current and future products 

to maintain its right to produce or sell existing products or to commercialize new products containing biotechnology traits particularly seed products the company must be able to demonstrate its ability to satisfy the requirements of regulatory agencies sales into and use of seeds with biotechnology traits in jurisdictions where cultivation has been approved could be impacted if key import markets have not approved the import of grains food and food ingredients and other products derived from those seeds if import of grains food and food ingredients and other products derived from those seeds containing such biotechnology traits occurs in these markets it could lead to disruption in trade and potential liability for the company 

in addition the company’s regulatory compliance could be affected by the detection of low level presence of biotechnology traits in conventional seed or products produced from such seed furthermore the detection of biotechnology traits not approved in the country of cultivation may affect the company’s ability to supply product and could affect exports of products produced from such seeds and even result in crop destruction or product recalls 

a significant operational event could negatively impact the companys results of operations 

the companys operations the transportation of products cyberattacks or severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena such as drought hurricanes earthquakes tsunamis floods etc could result in an unplanned event that could be significant in scale and could negatively impact operations neighbors or the public at large which could have a negative impact on the companys results of operations 

major hurricanes have caused significant disruption in the companys operations on the us gulf coast logistics across the region and the supply of certain raw materials which had an adverse impact on volume and cost for some of the companys products due to the companys substantial presence on the us gulf coast similar severe weather conditions or other natural phenomena in the future could negatively impact the companys results of operations 

in addition terrorist attacks and natural disasters have increased concerns about the security and safety of chemical production and distribution local state federal and foreign governments continue to propose new regulations related to the security of chemical plant locations and the transportation of hazardous chemicals which could result in higher operating costs 

the risk of loss of the company’s intellectual property trade secrets or other sensitive business information or disruption of operations could negatively impact the company’s financial results 

cyberattacks or security breaches could compromise confidential business critical information cause a disruption in the company’s operations or harm the companys reputation the company has attractive information assets including intellectual property trade secrets and other sensitive business critical information while the company has a comprehensive cyber security program that is continuously reviewed maintained and upgraded a significant cyberattack could result in the loss of critical business information andor could negatively impact operations which could have a negative impact on the company’s financial results 

implementing certain elements of the companys strategy could negatively impact the companys financial results 

the company currently has manufacturing operations sales and marketing activities joint ventures as well as proposed and existing projects of varying size in emerging geographies activities in these geographic regions are accompanied by uncertainty and risks including navigating different government regulatory environments relationships with new local partners project funding commitments and guarantees expropriation military actions war terrorism and political instability sabotage uninsurable risks suppliers not performing as expected resulting in increased risk of extended project timelines and determining raw material supply and other details regarding product movement if the manufacturing operations sales and marketing activities andor implementation of these projects is not successful it could adversely affect the companys financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets could negatively impact the companys financial results 

at least annually the company assesses both goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment intangible assets with finite lives are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable if testing indicates that goodwill or intangible assets are impaired the carrying values are written down based on fair values with a charge against earnings where the company utilizes discounted cash flow methodologies in determining fair values continued weak demand for a specific product line or business could result in an impairment accordingly any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of goodwill or intangible assets could negatively impact the companys results of operations 

as a result of the merger and the related acquisition method of accounting which resulted in duponts assets and liabilities being measured at fair value the companys goodwill increased by 451 billion  and the companys intangible assets increased by 272 billion  future impairments of either could be recorded in results of operations due to changes in assumptions estimates or circumstances and there can be no assurance that such impairments would be immaterial to the company dupont or dow 

increased obligations and expenses related to duponts and dows defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans could negatively impact dowduponts financial condition and results of operations 

dupont and dow have defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans opeb collectively the “plans” in the united states and a number of other countries the assets of the dupont and dow funded plans are primarily invested in fixed income and equity securities of us and foreign issuers changes in the market value of plan assets investment returns discount rates mortality rates regulations and the rate of increase in compensation levels may affect the funded status of the plans and could cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost future funding requirements of the plans and the funded status of the plans a significant increase in duponts and dows obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on the companys results of operations and cash flows for a particular period and on the companys financial condition 

unpredictable seasonal and weather factors could impact sales and earnings from the company’s agriculture segment 

the agriculture industry is subject to seasonal and weather factors which can vary unpredictably from period to period weather factors can affect the presence of disease and pests on a regional basis and accordingly can positively or adversely affect the demand for crop protection products including the mix of products used the weather also can affect the quality volume and cost of seed produced for sale as well as demand and product mix seed yields can be higher or lower than planned which could lead to higher inventory and related writeoffs and affect the ability to supply 

inability to discover develop and protect new technologies and enforce the companys intellectual property rights and to respond to new technologies could adversely affect the companys financial results 

the company competes with major global companies that have strong intellectual property rights including rights supporting the use of biotechnology to enhance products particularly agricultural and biobased products speed in discovering developing protecting and responding to new technologies including new technologybased distribution channels that could impede the companys ability to engage with customers and end user and bringing related products to market is a significant competitive advantage failure to predict and respond effectively could cause the companys existing or candidate products to become less competitive adversely affecting sales competitors are increasingly challenging intellectual property positions and the outcomes can be highly uncertain if challenges are resolved adversely it could negatively impact the companys ability to obtain licenses on competitive terms commercialize new products and generate sales from existing products 

intellectual property rights including patents plant variety protection trade secrets confidential information trademarks tradenames and other forms of trade dress are important to the companys business the company endeavors to protect its intellectual property rights in jurisdictions in which its products are produced or used and in jurisdictions into which its products are imported however the company may be unable to obtain protection for its intellectual property in key jurisdictions further changes in government policies and regulations including changes made in reaction to pressure from nongovernmental organizations could impact the extent of intellectual property protection afforded by such jurisdictions 

the majority of the company’s corn hybrids and soybean varieties sold to customers contain biotechnology traits that are licensed from third parties under longterm licenses if the company loses its rights under such licenses it could negatively impact the companys ability to obtain future licenses on competitive terms commercialize new products and generate sales from existing products 

the company has designed and implemented internal controls to restrict access to and distribution of its intellectual property despite these precautions the companys intellectual property is vulnerable to unauthorized access through employee error or actions theft and cybersecurity incidents and other security breaches when unauthorized access and use or counterfeit products are discovered the company reports such situations to governmental authorities for investigation as appropriate and takes measures to mitigate any potential impact protecting intellectual property related to biotechnology is particularly challenging because theft is difficult to detect and biotechnology can be selfreplicating accordingly the impact of such theft can be significant 

failure to effectively manage acquisitions divestitures alliances and other portfolio actions could adversely impact dowduponts future results 

the company made certain divestitures primarily related to its agriculture segment in connection with obtaining regulatory approval for the merger in addition the company from time to time evaluates acquisition candidates that may strategically fit its business andor growth objectives if the company is unable to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses the company could fail to achieve anticipated synergies and cost savings including any expected increases in revenues and operating results which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results the company continually reviews its portfolio of assets for contributions to the company’s objectives and alignment with its growth strategy however the company may not be successful in separating underperforming or nonstrategic assets and gains or losses on the divestiture of or lost operating income from such assets may affect the company’s earnings moreover the company might incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures that reduce its earnings in addition if the execution or implementation of acquisitions divestitures alliances joint ventures and other portfolio actions is not successful it could adversely impact the company’s financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

dowdupont’s results of operations could be adversely affected by litigation and other commitments and contingencies 

the company faces risks arising from various unasserted and asserted litigation matters including but not limited to asbestosrelated suits product liability patent infringement antitrust claims governmental regulations contract and commercial litigation claims for third party property damage or personal injury stemming from alleged environmental torts and other actions the company has noted a nationwide trend in purported class actions against chemical manufacturers generally seeking relief such as medical monitoring property damages offsite remediation and punitive damages arising from alleged environmental torts without claiming present personal injuries the company also has noted a trend in public and private suits being filed on behalf of states counties cities and utilities alleging harm to the general public and the environment including waterways and watersheds an adverse outcome in any one or more of these matters could be material to the companys financial results 

see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on litigation and other commitments and contingencies faced by the company 

in the ordinary course of business the company may make certain commitments including representations warranties and indemnities relating to current and past operations including those related to divested businesses and issue guarantees of third 

party obligations if the company were required to make payments as a result they could exceed the amounts accrued thereby adversely affecting the companys results of operations

goodwill 

in the fourth quarter of 2017 the company early adopted asu 201704 intangibles  goodwill and other topic 350 simplifying the test for goodwill impairment as part of the annual goodwill impairment testing see note 2  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

the company performs goodwill impairment testing at the reporting unit level which is defined as the operating segment or one level below the operating segment one level below the operating segment or component is a business in which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management the company aggregates certain components into reporting units based on economic similarities the operating segment is the reporting unit for agriculture electronics  imaging nutrition  health and transportation  advanced polymers operating segments the company tests goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit has declined below its carrying value goodwill is evaluated for impairment using qualitative andor quantitative testing procedures at december 31 2017 the company has defined 9 operating segments and 18 reporting units goodwill is carried by 17 of these reporting units 

the company has the option to first perform qualitative testing to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value qualitative factors assessed at the company level include but are not limited to gdp growth rates longterm hydrocarbon and energy prices equity and credit market activity discount rates foreign exchange rates and overall financial performance qualitative factors assessed at the reporting unit level include but are not limited to changes in industry and market structure competitive environments planned capacity and new product launches cost factors such as raw material prices and financial performance of the reporting unit if the company chooses not to complete a qualitative assessment for a given reporting unit or if the initial assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value additional quantitative testing is required 

quantitative testing requires the fair value of the reporting unit to be compared with its carrying value if the reporting units carrying value exceeds its fair value an impairment charge is recognized for the difference the company utilizes a discounted cash flow methodology to calculate the fair value of its reporting units this valuation technique has been selected by management as the most meaningful valuation method due to the limited number of market comparables for the companys reporting units however where market comparables are available the company includes ebitebitda multiples as part of the reporting unit valuation analysis the discounted cash flow valuations are completed using the following key assumptions including certain ranges used for the 2017 testing projected revenue growth rates or compounded annual growth rates over a five to tenyear cash flow forecast period which ranged from 01 percent to 64 percent and varied by reporting unit based on underlying business fundamentals and future expectations discount rates which ranged from 72 percent to 93 percent tax rates terminal values differentiated based on the cash flow projection of each reporting unit and the projected net operating profit after tax nopat growth rate which ranged from 05 percent to 30 percent currency exchange rates and forecasted longterm hydrocarbon and energy prices by geographic region and by year which included the companys key feedstocks as well as natural gas and crude oil due to its correlation to naphtha these key assumptions are determined through evaluation of the company as a whole and underlying business fundamentals and industry risk 

the company also monitors and evaluates its market capitalization relative to book value when the market capitalization of the company falls below book value management undertakes a process to evaluate whether a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of its reporting units has declined below carrying value this evaluation process includes the use of thirdparty marketbased valuations and internal discounted cash flow analysis as part of the annual goodwill impairment test the company also compares market capitalization with the most recent total estimated fair value of its reporting units to ensure that significant differences are understood at december 31 2017 the companys market capitalization exceeded book value 

2017 goodwill impairment testing 

effective with the merger the company updated its reporting units to align with the level at which discrete financial information is available for review by management in connection with the merger the company recorded 45105 million  of goodwill representing the preliminary fair value as of the effective date of the merger goodwill resulting from the merger was assigned to reporting units based on the acquisition method of accounting and is considered preliminary for the remaining goodwill balance a relative fair value method was used to reallocate goodwill for reporting units of which the composition had changed no impairment indicators were identified as a result of the updated reporting unit alignment and reallocation of goodwill in the f ourth  quarter of 2017 quantitative testing was performed on twelve reporting units and a qualitative assessment was performed on the remaining reporting units that carry goodwill 

for the qualitative assessments management considered the factors at both the company level and the reporting unit level based on the qualitative assessment management concluded it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit 

upon completion of quantitative testing in the fourth quarter of 2017 the company determined the coatings  performance monomers reporting unit was impaired throughout 2017 the coatings  performance monomers reporting unit did not consistently meet expected financial performance targets primarily due to increasing commoditization in coatings markets and competition as well as customer consolidation in end markets which have reduced growth opportunities as a result the coatings  performance monomers reporting unit lowered future revenue and profitability expectations the fair value of the coatings  performance monomers reporting unit was determined using a discounted cash flow methodology that reflected reductions in projected revenue growth rates primarily driven by modified sales volume and pricing assumptions as well as revised expectations for future growth rates these discounted cash flows did not support the carrying value of the coatings  performance monomers reporting unit as a result the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge for the coatings  performance monomers reporting unit of 1491 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 included in “restructuring goodwill impairment and asset related charges  net” in the consolidated statements of income and related to the performance materials  coatings segment at december 31 2017 the coatings  performance monomers reporting unit carried 1071 million  of goodwill 

the fair values of the remaining reporting units exceeded their carrying values and no other goodwill impairments were identified as a result of the 2017 testing 

pension and other postretirement benefits 

the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets discount rates at which the liabilities could have been settled rate of increase in future compensation levels mortality rates and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are updated annually in accordance with us gaap actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods the us pension plans represent the majority of dow and dupont’s pension plan assets and pension obligations 

effective january 1 2016 dow adopted the spot rate approach to determine the discount rate utilized to measure the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs for the us and other selected countries dupont also adopted the spot rate approach for its us plans under the spot rate approach dow and dupont calculate service costs and interest costs by applying individual spot rates from a yield curve based on highquality corporate bond yields for each selected country to the separate expected cash flow components of service cost and interest cost service cost and interest cost for all other plans are determined on the basis of the single equivalent discount rates derived in determining those plan obligations dow and dupont changed to the new method to provide a more precise measure of interest and service costs for certain plans by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the discrete spot yield curves the change in accounting estimate was applied prospectively starting in 2016 

the following information relates to dow and duponts us plans only a similar approach is used for dow and duponts nonus plans dow and dupont determine the expected longterm rate of return on assets by performing a detailed analysis of historical and expected returns based on the strategic asset allocation and the underlying return fundamentals of each asset class the historical experience of the pension fund asset performance is also considered the expected return of each asset class is derived from a forecasted future return confirmed by historical experience the expected longterm rate of return is an assumption and not what is expected to be earned in any one particular year the weightedaverage longterm rate of return assumption used for determining net periodic pension expense for 2017 was 746  percent the assumption used for determining 2018 net periodic pension expense is 708 percent future actual pension expense will depend on future investment performance changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the population of participants in the company’s pension plans 

the discount rates utilized to measure the pension and other postretirement obligations of the us plans are based on the yield on highquality corporate fixed income investments at the measurement date future expected actuarially determined cash flows are individually discounted at spot rates under the willis towers watson us ratelink 6090 corporate yield curve for dows plans and under the aon hewitt aaabove median yield curve for duponts plans to arrive at the plans obligations as of the measurement date the weighted average discount rate utilized to measure pension obligations decreased to 366  percent at december 31 2017 from 411  percent at december 31 2016 

the assumption for the longterm rate of increase in compensation levels for the us plans was 425  percent dow and dupont use generational mortality tables to value their us pension and other postretirement obligations 

the following discussion relates to dows significant pension plans and duponts us qualified plan dow and dupont base the determination of pension expense on a marketrelated valuation of plan assets that reduces yeartoyear volatility for dow this marketrelated valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur for dupont the marketrelated value of assets is calculated by averaging market returns over 36 months as a result changes in the fair value of assets are not immediately reflected in the company’s calculation of net periodic pension cost over the life of the plans both gains and losses have been recognized and amortized at december 31 2017 net gains of 393 million  remain to be recognized in the calculation of the marketrelated value of plan assets these net gains will result in decreases in future pension expense as they are recognized in the marketrelated value of assets 

the net increase in the marketrelated value of assets due to the recognition of prior gains losses is presented in the following table 



the company expects pension expense to decrease in 2018 by approximately 900 million excluding dows settlement charge resulting from a change in control provision which occurred at the time of the merger pension expense is expected to decrease approximately 210 million in 2018 primarily due to the expected full year net credit for dupont’s plans as a result of the elimination of the net losses and prior service benefits recognized in dupont’s accumulated other comprehensive loss in connection with purchase accounting instead of benefit cost a net credit for dupont’s plans was recognized in 2017 postmerger and is anticipated for the full year of 2018 

a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the longterm return on assets assumption would change the company’s total pension expense for 2018 by 106 million a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate assumption would lower the companys total pension expense for 2018 by 34 million a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase the companys total pension expense for 2018 by 33 million a 25 basis point change in the longterm return and discount rate assumptions would have an immaterial impact on the other postretirement benefit expense for 2018 

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse based on the evaluation of available evidence both positive and negative the company recognizes future tax benefits such as net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered to be more likely than not 

at december 31 2017 the company had a net deferred tax liability balance of 4397 million  after valuation allowances of 2749 million  

in evaluating the ability to realize the deferred tax assets the company relies on in order of increasing subjectivity taxable income in prior carryback years the future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences tax planning strategies and forecasted taxable income using historical and projected future operating results 

at december 31 2017 the company had deferred tax assets for tax loss and tax credit carryforwards of 3425 million  337 million  of which is subject to expiration in the years 2018 through 2022 

the company recognizes the financial statement effects of an uncertain income tax position when it is more likely than not based on technical merits that the position will be sustained upon examination at december 31 2017 the company had uncertain tax positions for both domestic and foreign issues of 712 million  

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act “the act” was enacted making significant changes to the us tax law the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 “sab 118” which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the act for which the accounting under asc 740 income taxes “asc 740” is incomplete to the extent that a companys 

accounting for certain income tax effects of the act is incomplete but it is able to determine a reasonable estimate it must record a provisional estimate in the financial statements the provisional amounts and adjustments identified in the measurement period are recorded to the provision for income taxes on continuing operations in the period the amounts are determined in accordance with sab 118 income tax effects of the act may be refined upon obtaining preparing or analyzing additional information during the measurement period and such changes could be material sab 118 provides that the measurement period is complete when a companys accounting is complete and in no circumstances should the measurement period extend beyond one year from the enactment date if a company cannot determine a provisional estimate to be included in the financial statements it should continue to apply asc 740 on the basis of the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before enactment of the act for additional information see notes 1  and 8  to the consolidated financial statements

purchase accounting 

due to the merger and the related accounting determination dupont’s assets and liabilities were measured at fair value as of the date of the merger estimates of fair value require a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties in determining the fair value dowdupont utilized various forms of the income cost and market approaches depending on the asset or liability being fair valued the estimation of fair value required significant judgments related to future net cash flows including net sales cost of products sold selling and marketing costs and working capitalcontributory asset charges discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in each cash flow stream competitive trends market comparables and other factors inputs were generally determined by taking into account historical data supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions and growth ratesthe estimates and assumptions used to determine the preliminary estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets and liabilities as well as asset lives have a material impact to the companys consolidated financial statements and are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain third party valuation specialists were engaged to assist in the valuation of certain of these assets and liabilities

dow’s ehs policies helped achieve improvements in many aspects of ehs performance in 2017 dow’s process safety performance was excellent in 2017 and improvements were made in injuryillness rates safety remains a priority for dow further improvement in these areas as well as environmental compliance remains a top management priority with initiatives underway to further improve performance and compliance in 2018 as dow continues to implement its 2025 sustainability goals

environmental policies  dupont 

dupont operates global manufacturing product handling and distribution facilities that are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations such rules are subject to change by the implementing governmental agency and dupont monitors these changes closely duponts policy requires that all operations fully meet or exceed legal and regulatory requirements in addition dupont implements voluntary programs to reduce air emissions minimize the generation of hazardous waste decrease the volume of water use and discharges increase the efficiency of energy use and reduce the generation of persistent bioaccumulative and toxic materials management has noted a global upward trend in the amount and complexity of proposed chemicals regulation the costs to comply with complex environmental laws and regulations as well as internal voluntary programs and goals are significant and will continue to be significant for the foreseeable future 

climate change  dow 

climate change matters for dow are likely to be driven by changes in regulations public policy and physical climate parameters 

regulatory matters 

regulatory matters include cap and trade schemes increased greenhouse gas “ghg” limits and taxes on ghg emissions fuel and energy the potential implications of each of these matters are all very similar including increased costs of purchased energy additional capital costs for installation or modification of ghg emitting equipment and additional costs associated directly with ghg emissions such as cap and trade systems or carbon taxes which are primarily related to energy use it is difficult to estimate the potential impact of these regulatory matters on energy prices 

reducing dows overall energy usage and ghg emissions through new and unfolding projects will decrease the potential impact of these regulatory matters dow also has a dedicated commercial group to handle energy contracts and purchases including managing emissions trading dow has not experienced any material impact related to regulated ghg emissions and continues to evaluate and monitor this area for future developments 

physical climate parameters 

many scientific academies throughout the world have concluded that it is very likely that human activities are contributing to global warming at this point it is difficult to predict and assess the probability and opportunity of a global warming trend on dow specifically preparedness plans are developed that detail actions needed in the event of severe weather these measures have historically been in place and these activities and associated costs are driven by normal operational preparedness dow continues to study the longterm implications of changing climate parameters on water availability plant siting issues and impacts and opportunities for products 

dow’s energy business and public affairs and sustainability functions are tasked with developing and implementing a comprehensive strategy that addresses the potential challenges of energy security and ghg emissions dow continues to elevate its internal focus and external positions  to focus on the root causes of ghg emissions  including the unsustainable use of energy dows energy plan provides the roadmap 

 

through corporate energy efficiency programs and focused ghg management efforts dow has and is continuing to reduce its ghg emissions footprint dow’s manufacturing intensity measured in btu per pound of product has improved by more than 40 percent since 1990 as part of its 2025 sustainability goals dow will maintain ghg emissions below 2006 levels on an absolute basis for all ghgs 

dow intends to implement the recommendations of the financial stability boards task force on climaterelated disclosures task force over the next three to five years which is aligned with the recommendations of the task force 

climate change  dupont 

dupont believes that climate change is an important global issue that presents risks and opportunities expanding upon significant global ghg emissions and other environmental footprint reductions made in the period 19902010 in 2015 dupont announced its 2020 sustainability goals including a goal to achieve a 7 percent reduction in ghg emissions intensity 2015 baseline and a 10 percent improvement in energy intensity 2010 baseline as of 2016 dupont achieved reductions of 13 percent in ghg emissions intensity against the goal baseline of 2015 and 8 percent since 2010 in addition dupont has achieved a 108 percent improvement in energy intensity since 2010 dupont continuously evaluates opportunities for existing and new product and service offerings in light of the anticipated demands of a lowcarbon economy 

dupont is actively engaged in efforts to develop constructive public policies to reduce ghg emissions and encourage lower carbon forms of energy such policies may bring higher operating costs as well as greater revenue and margin opportunities legislative efforts to control or limit ghg emissions could affect duponts energy source and supply choices as well as increase the cost of energy and raw materials derived from fossil fuels such efforts are also anticipated to provide the business community with greater certainty for the regulatory future help guide investment decisions and drive growth in demand for lowcarbon and energyefficient products technologies and services similarly demand is expected to grow for products that facilitate adaptation to a changing climate however the current unsettled policy environment in the us where many dupont facilities are located adds an element of uncertainty to business decisions particularly those relating to longterm capital investments 

in addition significant differences in regional or national approaches could present challenges in a global marketplace an effective global climate policy framework will help drive the market changes that are needed to stimulate and efficiently deploy new innovations in science and technology while maintaining open and competitive global markets 

dowdupont environmental remediation   

environmental capital expenditures 

capital expenditures for environmental projects either required by law or necessary to meet the company’s internal environmental goals were 97 million  in 2017 

environmental operating costs and remediation 

as a result of the dow and dupont operations dowdupont incurs environmental operating costs for pollution abatement activities including waste collection and disposal installation and maintenance of air pollution controls and wastewater treatment emissions testing and monitoring and obtaining permits the company also incurs environmental operating costs related to environmental related research and development activities including environmental field and treatment studies as well as toxicity and degradation testing to evaluate the environmental impact of products and raw materials 

pretax environmental expenses charged to income from continuing operations are summarized below 



 

based on existing facts and circumstances management does not believe that year over year changes in environmental expenses charged to current operations will have a material impact on the companys financial position liquidity or results of operations annual expenditures in the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures experienced in the past few years longer term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly 

changes in the remediation accrual balance are summarized below 



 

considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation and costs and under adverse changes in circumstances it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to two and a half  times above the amount accrued consequently it is reasonably possible that environmental remediation and restoration costs in excess of amounts accrued could have a material impact on the company’s results of operations financial condition and cash flows it is the opinion of the company’s management however that the possibility is remote that costs in excess of the range disclosed will have a material impact on the company’s results of operations financial condition or cash flows for further discussion see environmental matters in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and notes 1 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

information regarding environmental sites is provided below 



 

additional information is provided below for dow’s midland michigan manufacturing site and midland offsite locations collectively the midland sites as well as a superfund site in woodridge new jersey the locations for dow that have the largest potential environmental liabilities 

in the early days of operations at the dow midland manufacturing site wastes were usually disposed of onsite resulting in soil and groundwater contamination which has been contained and managed onsite under a series of resource conservation and recovery act permits and regulatory agreements the hazardous waste operating license for the midland manufacturing site issued in 2003 and renewed and replaced in september 2015 also included provisions for dow to conduct an investigation to determine the nature and extent of offsite contamination from historic midland manufacturing site operations in january 2010 dow the epa and the state of michigan state entered into an administrative order on consent that requires dow to conduct 

a remedial investigation a feasibility study and a remedial design for the tittabawassee river the saginaw river and the saginaw bay and pay the oversight costs of the epa and the state under the authority of the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act see note 16  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information at december 31 2017 dow had an accrual of 131 million   137 million  at december 31 2016 for environmental remediation and investigation associated with the midland sites in 2017 dow spent 24 million   36 million  in 2016 for environmental remediation at the midland sites 

rohm and haas a wholly owned subsidiary of dow is a prp at the woodridge new jersey ventronvelsicol superfund site and the adjacent berry’s creek study area bcsa collectively the woodridge sites rohm and haas is a successor in interest to a company that owned and operated a mercury processing facility where wastewater and waste handling resulted in contamination of soils and adjacent creek sediments the berry’s creek study area prp group completed a multistage remedial investigation ri pursuant to an administrative order on consent with us epa region 2 to identify contamination in surface water sediment and biota related to numerous contaminated sites in the berrys creek watershed and submitted the report to the epa in june 2016 that same month the epa concluded that an iterative or adaptive approach was appropriate for cleaning up the bcsa thus each phase of remediation will be followed by a period of monitoring to assess its effectiveness and determine if there is a need for more work the feasibility study fs for the first phase of work will be submitted in the second half of 2018 the epa will then review the remedial options presented in the fs select the remedy and issue an interim record of decision rod the prp group will then attempt to negotiate agreements among the prps to fund the selected remedy and with the epa to perform the remediation although there is currently much uncertainty as to what will ultimately be required to remediate the bcsa and rohm and haass share of these costs has yet to be determined the range of activities that will be required in the interim rod is known in general terms based on the first phase of the ri and agreement with the epa the overall remediation accrual for the woodridge sites was increased by 80 million  in the fourth quarter of 2016 at december 31 2017 the company had an accrual of 88 million   91 million  at december 31 2016 for environmental remediation at the woodridge sites in 2017 dow spent 7 million   6 million  in 2016 on environmental remediation at the woodridge sites 

in the fourth quarter of 2016 dow recorded a pretax charge of 295 million  for environmental remediation at a number of historical locations including the midland manufacturing siteoffsite matters and the woodridge sites primarily resulting from the culmination of negotiations with regulators andor final agency approval this charge was included in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of income in total the company’s accrued liability for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs was 1311 million  at december 31 2017 compared with 909 million  at december 31 2016 this is management’s best estimate of the costs for remediation and restoration with respect to environmental matters for which the company has accrued liabilities although it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to approximately two and a half times that amount consequently it is reasonably possible that environmental remediation and restoration costs in excess of amounts accrued could have a material impact on the company’s results of operations financial condition and cash flows it is the opinion of the company’s management however that the possibility is remote that costs in excess of the range disclosed will have a material impact on the company’s results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

separation of duponts performance chemicals segment 

pursuant to the separation agreement discussed in note 16  to the consolidated financial statements dupont is indemnified by chemours for certain environmental matters included in the liability of 1311 million  that had an estimated liability of 242 million at december 31 2017 and a potential exposure that ranges up to approximately 430 million above the current accrual as such dupont has recorded an indemnification asset of 242 million corresponding to duponts accrual balance related to these matters at december 31 2017 

asbestosrelated matters of union carbide corporation 

union carbide is and has been involved in a large number of asbestosrelated suits filed primarily in state courts during the past four decades these suits principally allege personal injury resulting from exposure to asbestoscontaining products and frequently seek both actual and punitive damages the alleged claims primarily relate to products that union carbide sold in the past alleged exposure to asbestoscontaining products located on union carbide’s premises and union carbide’s responsibility for asbestos suits filed against a former union carbide subsidiary amchem in many cases plaintiffs are unable to demonstrate that they have suffered any compensable loss as a result of such exposure or that injuries incurred in fact resulted from exposure to union carbide’s products 

the table below provides information regarding asbestosrelated claims pending against union carbide and amchem based on criteria developed by union carbide and its external consultants union carbide had a significant increase in the number of claims settled dismissed or otherwise resolved in 2015 resulting from a detailed review of the status of individual claims and an update to criteria used to classify claims 



plaintiffs’ lawyers often sue numerous defendants in individual lawsuits or on behalf of numerous claimants as a result the damages alleged are not expressly identified as to union carbide amchem or any other particular defendant even when specific damages are alleged with respect to a specific disease or injury in fact there are no personal injury cases in which only union carbide andor amchem are the sole named defendants for these reasons and based upon union carbide’s litigation and settlement experience union carbide does not consider the damages alleged against union carbide and amchem to be a meaningful factor in its determination of any potential asbestosrelated liability 

for additional information see part i item 3 legal proceedings and asbestosrelated matters of union carbide corporation and note 16  to the consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

dowduponts risk management programs are managed separately by dow and dupont dow and dupont have historically utilized different methods to report their quantitative information about market risk dow uses a valueatrisk var approach while dupont uses sensitivity analysis both methods are acceptable under regulation sk and are viewed as equally effective from a risk monitoring perspective as the risk management programs for dow and dupont will continue to be managed separately the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk will be provided for each subsidiary as discussed below 

dow 

dow’s business operations give rise to market risk exposure due to changes in foreign exchange rates interest rates commodity prices and other market factors such as equity prices to manage such risks effectively dow enters into hedging transactions pursuant to established guidelines and policies that enable it to mitigate the adverse effects of financial market risk derivatives used for this purpose are designated as hedges per the accounting guidance related to derivatives and hedging activities where appropriate a secondary objective is to add value by creating additional nonspecific exposure within established limits and policies derivatives used for this purpose are not designated as hedges the potential impact of creating such additional exposures is not material to dow’s results 

the global nature of dow’s business requires active participation in the foreign exchange markets as a result of investments production facilities and other operations on a global basis dow has assets liabilities and cash flows in currencies other than the us dollar the primary objective of dow’s foreign exchange risk management is to optimize the us dollar value of net assets and cash flows keeping the adverse impact of currency movements to a minimum to achieve this objective dow hedges on a net exposure basis using foreign currency forward contracts overthecounter option contracts crosscurrency swaps and nonderivative instruments in foreign currencies exposures primarily relate to assets liabilities and bonds denominated in foreign currencies as well as economic exposure which is derived from the risk that currency fluctuations could affect the dollar value of future cash flows related to operating activities the largest exposures are denominated in european currencies the japanese yen and the chinese yuan although exposures also exist in other currencies of asia pacific canada latin america middle east africa and india 

the main objective of interest rate risk management is to reduce the total funding cost to dow and to alter the interest rate exposure to the desired risk profile dow uses interest rate swaps “swaptions” and exchangetraded instruments to accomplish this objective dow’s primary exposure is to the us dollar yield curve 

dow has a portfolio of equity securities derived primarily from the investment activities of its insurance subsidiaries this exposure is managed in a manner consistent with dow’s market risk policies and procedures 

inherent in dow’s business is exposure to price changes for several commodities some exposures can be hedged effectively through liquid tradable financial instruments natural gas and crude oil along with feedstocks for ethylene and propylene production constitute the main commodity exposures overthecounter and exchange traded instruments are used to hedge these risks when feasible 

dow uses var stress testing and scenario analysis for risk measurement and control purposes var estimates the maximum potential loss in fair market values given a certain move in prices over a certain period of time using specified confidence levels the var methodology used by dow is a variancecovariance model this model uses a 975 percent confidence level and includes at least one year of historical data the 2017 and 2016 yearend and average daily var for the aggregate of all positions are shown below these amounts are immaterial relative to the total equity of dow 



dow’s daily var for the aggregate of all positions decreased from a composite var of 151 million at december 31 2016  to a composite var of 132 million at december 31 2017  the commodities var increased due to an increase in longterm managed exposures the equity securities var decreased due to a reduction in managed exposures and a decline in equity volatility the interest rate var decreased due to a drop in yield volatility see note 21  to the consolidated financial statements for further disclosure regarding market risk 

dupont   

dupont’s global operations are exposed to financial market risks relating to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates dupont has established a variety of programs including the use of derivative instruments and other financial instruments to manage the exposure to financial market risks as to minimize volatility of financial results in the ordinary course of business dupont enters into derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign currency interest rate and commodity price risks under established procedures and controls decisions regarding whether or not to hedge a given commitment are made on a casebycase basis taking into consideration the amount and duration of the exposure market volatility and economic trends 

foreign currency exchange rate risks 

dupont has significant international operations resulting in a large number of currency transactions that result from international sales purchases investments and borrowings the primary currencies for which dupont has an exchange rate exposure are the european euro chinese yuan brazilian real and japanese yen dupont uses forward exchange contracts to offset its net exposures by currency related to the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities of its operations in addition to the contracts disclosed in note 21  to the consolidated financial statements from time to time dupont will enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to establish with certainty the us dollar amount of future firm commitments denominated in a foreign currency 

the following table illustrates the fair values of outstanding foreign currency contracts at december 31 2017 and the effect on fair values of a hypothetical adverse change in the foreign exchange rates that existed at december 31 2017 the sensitivities for foreign currency contracts are based on a 10 percent adverse change in foreign exchange rates 



since duponts risk management programs are highly effective the potential loss in value for each risk management portfolio described above would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure 

concentration of credit risk 

dupont maintains cash and cash equivalents marketable securities derivatives and certain other financial instruments with various financial institutions these financial institutions are generally highly rated and geographically dispersed and dupont has a policy to limit the dollar amount of credit exposure with any one institution 

as part of duponts financial risk management processes it continuously evaluates the relative credit standing of all of the financial institutions that service dupont and monitors actual exposures versus established limits dupont has not sustained credit losses from instruments held at financial institutions
