our industry 

our planet faces serious water challenges less than 1 of the total water available on earth is fresh water and these supplies are threatened by factors such as the draining of aquifers increased pollution and the effects of climate change demand for fresh water is rising rapidly due to population growth industrial expansion and increased agricultural development with consumption estimated to double every 20 years by 2025 more than 30 of the world’s population is expected to live in areas without adequate water supply even in developed countries with sufficient clean water supply existing water supply infrastructure is aging and often inefficient in the us deteriorating pipe systems theft or inaccurate meters result in approximately one out of every six gallons of treated water being lost prior to reaching the end customer this problem of nonrevenue water is a major financial challenge of many utilities globally especially in developing markets where nonrevenue water can represent 10 to 60 or more of net water produced these and other challenges create opportunities for growth in the global water industry we estimate the total addressable market size of the global water industry excluding operational expenditures related to labor energy and chemicals to be approximately 600 billion 

global water needs cannot be met without streamlining the water industry’s cost structure with technologies that fundamentally change the provision and management of water we compete in areas that are pivotal to improving water affordability and resilience while reducing the impact of water scarcity water affordability refers to the more efficient delivery use and treatment of clean water and wastewater resilience refers to the management of waterrelated risks including climate change mitigation and the resilience of water infrastructure water scarcity refers to the management of limited supplies of water due to climate change overpopulation and pollution our customers often face all three of these challenges ranging from inefficient and aging water distribution networks and energyintensive or unreliable water and wastewater management systems requiring improvements in water affordability droughts and pollution which limit the amount of water readily available causing water scarcity or exposure to natural disasters such as floods or droughts requiring improvements in resilience additionally we also provide solutions to enhance communications and efficiency improve safety and conserve resources to customers in the water and energy sectors delivering value in these areas creates significant opportunity for the company

business segments distribution and competitive landscape 

we have t hree reportable business segments that are aligned around the critical market applications they provide water infrastructure applied water and measurement  control solutions see note 22 “segment and geographic data” in our consolidated financial statements for financial information about segments and geographic areas 

the table and descriptions below provide an overview of our business segments 



water infrastructure 

our water infrastructure segment primarily supports the process that collects water from a source treats it and distributes it to users and then treats and returns the wastewater responsibly to the environment through two closely linked applications transport and treatment the transport application also includes sales and rental of specialty dewatering pumps and related equipment and services which provide the safe removal or draining of groundwater and surface water from construction sites or other industrial sites and bypass pumping for the repair of aging utility infrastructure as well as emergency water transport and removal during severe weather events 

the customer base consists of two primary end markets utility and industrial the utility market includes public private and publicprivate entities that support water wastewater and storm water networks the industrial market includes customers that require similar water and wastewater infrastructure networks to support various industrial operations 

water infrastructure sells primarily through direct channels with remaining sales through indirect channels and service capabilities both utility and industrial facility customers increasingly require our teams’ global but locally proficient expertise to use our equipment in their specific applications several trends are increasing demand for this application expertise i the increase in both the type and amount of contaminants found in the water supply ii increasing environmental regulations iii the need to increase system efficiencies and resilience to optimize energy and other operational costs iv the retirement of an aging water industry workforce that has not been systematically renewed at utilities and other enduser customers and v the buildout of water infrastructure in the emerging markets 

given the highly fragmented nature of the water industry the water infrastructure segment competes with a large number of businesses and no one business competes across all the markets water infrastructure serves we differentiate ourselves in the market by focusing on product and service performance quality and reliability innovation speed to market with new or disruptive technologies and business models application expertise brand reputation energy efficiency product security product lifecycle cost timeliness of delivery proximity of service centers effectiveness of our distribution channels price and customers experience in doing business with us increasingly digital solutions and analytics are important competitive differentiators we are actively expanding our capabilities in these areas and integrating them together with our legacy technologies and service offerings as well as capabilities from other xylem business units to present ever more compelling solutions to our customers in the sale or rental of products and provision of services we benefit from our large installed base which requires maintenance repair and replacement parts due to the critical application and nature of the products and the conditions under which they operate timeliness of delivery quality and the proximity of service centers are important customer considerations when selecting a provider for aftermarket products and services as well as equipment rentals in geographic regions where we are locally positioned to provide a quick response customers have historically relied on us rather than our competitors for aftermarket products relating to our highly engineered and customized solutions our key competitors in the water infrastructure segment include ksb inc sulzer ltd evoqua water technologies united rentals trojan danaher corporation and grundfos

the majority of our sales in the us are conducted through strong longstanding relationships with leading distributors and dedicated channel partners for the water and energy markets internationally direct sales are often made in markets without established distribution channels however some distribution channels are used in more developed markets a more direct sales approach with key account management is employed for large utilities and government programs 

macro growth drivers include increasing regulation aging infrastructure and worldwide movement towards smart grid implementation water scarcity and conservation as well as the need to prevent revenue loss via inaccurate meter readings leaks or theft are among the drivers of smart meter and leak detection technologies 

our sensusbranded meters are well positioned in the smart metering sector the fastest growing sector of the global meter industry we set ourselves apart in the industry by focusing on our communication network innovation new product development and service offerings that deliver tangible savings of nonrevenue water through improved meter accuracy reduced theft and identification of leaks our pure technologies equipment and services are also well positioned in the leak detection sector which is attracting considerable attention as aging infrastructure and increased regulatory scrutiny exert pressure on operating budgets our key competitors in the measurement  control solutions segment include itron badger meter landisgyr neptune roper elster honeywell echologics mueller water products hach danaher corporation and teledyne 

geographic profile 

the table below illustrates the annual revenue and percentage of revenue by geographic area for each of the three years ended december 31 



a emerging markets includes results from the following regions eastern europe the middle east and africa latin america and asia pacific excluding japan australia and new zealand which are presented in other 

supply and seasonality 

we have a global manufacturing and assembly footprint with production facilities in europe north america latin america asia and the middle east all of our businesses require various parts and raw materials the availability and prices of which may fluctuate parts and raw materials commonly used in our products include motors fabricated parts castings bearings seals batteries printed circuit boards pcbs and electronic components including semiconductors as well as commodities including steel brass nickel copper aluminum and plastics while we may recover some cost increases through operational improvements we are still exposed to pricing risk including 

due to duty and tariff assessments by the us or other governments on foreign imports we attempt to control costs through fixedpriced contracts with suppliers and various other programs such as our global procurement initiative 

our business relies on thirdparty suppliers contract manufacturing and commodity markets to secure raw materials parts and components used in our products we typically acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our materials requirements for many of our products we have existing alternate sources of supply or such sources may be readily available 

we may experience price volatility or supply constraints for materials that are not available from multiple sources from time to time we acquire certain inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longerterm pricing commitments with suppliers to improve the priority price and availability of supply 

our business segments experience a modest level of seasonality in their operations this seasonality is dependent on factors such as customers capital spending as well as the effects of climate change and weather conditions including heavy flooding prolonged droughts and fluctuations in temperatures or weather patterns all of which can positively or negatively impact portions of our business 

customers 

our business is not dependent on any single customer or a few customers the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our company no individual customer accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated revenues in 2021 2020 or 2019 

backlog 

backlog includes orders on hand as well as contractual customer agreements at the end of the period delivery schedules vary from customer to customer based on their requirements annual or multiyear contracts are subject to rescheduling and cancellation by customers due to the longterm nature of the contracts as such beginning total backlog plus orders minus revenues will not equal ending total backlog due to contract adjustments foreign currency fluctuations and other factors typically large projects require longer lead production cycles and deployment schedules and delays occur from time to time total backlog was 3240 million at december 31 2021 and 2124 million at december 31 2020 we anticipate that approximately 60 of the backlog at december 31 2021 will be recognized as revenue during 2022 

research and development 

research and development “rd” is a key foundation of our growth strategy and we focus on the design and development of products and application knowhow that address anticipated customer needs and emerging trends our engineers are involved in new product development as well as improvement of existing products to increase customer value our businesses invest substantial resources into rd we anticipate we will continue to develop and invest in our rd capabilities to promote a steady flow of innovative highquality and reliable products and integrated solutions to further strengthen our position in the markets we serve in addition to investments made in software development which were capitalized we incurred 204 million 187 million and 191 million as a result of rd investment spending in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

we have rd and product development capabilities around the world rd activities are initially conducted in our technology centers located in conjunction with some of our major manufacturing facilities to enable an efficient and robust development process we have several global technical centers and local development teams around the world where we are supporting global needs and accelerating the customization of our products and solutions to address local needs in some cases our rd activities are conducted at our piloting and testing facilities and at strategic customer sites these piloting and testing facilities enable us to serve our strategic markets globally as part of expanding our bandwidth and to increase our access to technology we have built innovation ecosystem partnerships with academic institutions startup accelerators and venture capital organizations 

capitalized software 

we offer software as a product or service directly to external customers which is included within other intangible assets net on our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2021 and 2020 we had net capitalized software used in sales and services to external customers of 211 million and 182 million respectively 

intellectual property 

we generally seek patent protection for those inventions and improvements that we believe will improve our competitive position and are not suitable to be kept as a trade secret we believe that our patents and applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and improving our return on rd investments while we own control or license a significant number of patents trade secrets proprietary information trademarks trade names copyrights and other intellectual property rights which in the aggregate are of material importance to our business management believes that our business as a whole as well as each of our core business segments is not materially dependent on any one intellectual property right or related group of such rights 

patents patent applications and license agreements expire or terminate over time by operation of law in accordance with their terms or otherwise as the portfolio of our patents patent applications and license agreements has evolved over time we do not expect the expiration of any specific patent to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

governmental regulations 

environmental regulations 

our global operations are subject to various laws and regulations governing the environment and climate change such as those promulgated by the us environmental protection agency and similar state and foreign environmental agencies including the discharge of pollutants and the management and disposal of hazardous substances while environmental and climate change laws and regulations are subject to change such changes can be difficult to predict reliably and the timing of potential changes is uncertain management does not believe based on current circumstances that compliance costs pursuant to such regulations will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations however the effect of future legislative or regulatory changes could be material to our financial condition or results of operations 

we continue to be dedicated to environmental and sustainability programs to minimize the use of natural resources reduce the utilization and generation of hazardous materials from our processes and remediate identified environmental concerns we are currently engaged in site investigations and remediation activities to address environmental cleanup from past operations at a number of current and former manufacturing facilities we do not anticipate these liabilities will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations at december 31 2021 we had estimated and accrued 3 million related to environmental matters 

other regulations

• instability and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical environment including economic nationalism populism protectionism and antiglobal sentiment 

• changes in tax laws and potential negative consequences from the interpretation application and enforcement by governmental tax authorities of tax laws and policies 

• changes in other laws and regulations or how such provisions are interpreted or administered 

• disruptions in our global supply chain including with respect to labor shortages supply shortages and freight and logistics challenges 

• unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations including those related to infrastructure and data transmission security and privacy 

• shocks to the global financial system including due to global health crises the effects of climate change or idiosyncratic events such as a terrorist attack 

• theft compromise or misappropriation of technology intellectual property or data 

• foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations restrictions on repatriation of earnings or payment of distributions dividends loans or advances to us by foreign subsidiaries 

• disruption of operations from labor civil political or other disturbances 

• regional safety and security considerations 

• increased costs and risks in developing staffing and simultaneously managing a number of global operations as a result of distance remote work arrangements language and cultural differences and 

• threat outbreak uncertainty or escalation of political instability insurrection armed conflict terrorism epidemics global health crises or pandemics or war 

in 2021 44 of our revenues were generated in the us which included sales of products sold into federally funded projects we expect our us sales in 2022 and beyond to be similar however we may not be able to successfully compete for federally funded projects as some of our products may not comply with the domestic content requirements of the us buy american mandate applicable to the infrastructure investment and jobs act “iija” signed into law on november 15 2021 as well as other federally funded projects we are assessing the risks associated with the buy america mandate as well as related mitigation options around sourcing and manufacturing but there is no guarantee that we will be able to meet applicable domestic content requirements while governmental exemptions and waivers may in the future be issued that negate the application of the buy america mandate to some or all of our potential sales into iija and other federally funded projects it is uncertain whether and to what extent such exemptions or waivers may be issued an inability to meet applicable domestic content requirements for us federally funded projects could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we continue to monitor the impacts of the uk’s exit from the eu “brexit” on our supply chain operations and financial results the uk and the eus trade and cooperation agreement “tca” creates a number of risks and uncertainties for our businesses including 1 our services are subject to the world trade organization’s rules until the parties to the tca agree on rules around trade in services and 2 a delay in implementing final provisions on border checks with some transitional arrangements for 2021 being continued into 2022 the uk will also need to negotiate its own trade treaties with countries around the world which could take years to complete and any disagreements on trade terms could result in supply chain delays or other disruptions as a result we face continued uncertainty and risks of disruption in our supply chain and increased costs 

in the year ended december 31 2021 21 of our total revenues were generated in emerging markets and we have placed a particular emphasis in our strategy on increasing our growth and presence in emerging markets beyond the general risks that we face outside the us our operations in emerging markets are subject to additional risks and uncertainties including i governments may impose withholding or other taxes on remittances and other payments to us or the amount of any such taxes may increase ii governments may seek to nationalize our assets iii governments may impose or increase investment barriers or other restrictions affecting our business iv difficulty in enforcing agreements v challenges collecting receivables protecting our intellectual property and other assets vi pressure on the pricing of our products and services vii higher business conduct risks and viii challenges in our ability to hire and retain qualified talent and labor we cannot predict the impact that such factors might have on our business financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

the covid19 pandemic has adversely impacted and continues to pose risks to our business results of operations and financial condition the nature and extent of which are highly uncertain and unpredictable 

our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises including epidemics and pandemics the ongoing covid19 pandemic has had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our employees customers supply chain operations and sales the covid19 pandemic has and may in the future curtail the movement of people goods and services worldwide including in many of the regions where we sell our products and services and conduct operations governmentmandated precautions to mitigate the spread of covid19 including travel restrictions quarantines stay at home or similar measures in many of the areas in which we operate resulted in temporary production impacts at several of our facilities in 2020 and 2021 curtailed and may in the future curtail the business and operations of some of our customers and suppliers including our ability to access our customers’ sites if the covid19 pandemic continues or worsens including additional mutations of the virus we may experience a decline in sales and customer orders in certain of our businesses the covid19 pandemic and broader global market supply and demand dynamics also have impacted and continue to impact our supply chain with unpredictable disruptions due to component shortages including with respect to key electronic components such as semiconductors capacity constraints delays in shipment of materials necessary to the manufacture of our products freight and logistics challenges tight labor markets and inflation different markets and parts of our business will recover from the covid19 pandemic at different rates depending on many factors 

including vaccination levels or new covid19 variants and related outbreaks while we have taken measures to mitigate these impacts as the pandemic continues or if it worsens our manufacturing facilities supply chain and logistics may continue to be significantly impacted accordingly the pandemic has negatively impacted our revenue growth in certain of our businesses it is uncertain how materially the covid19 pandemic including additional mutations of the virus the corresponding rollout efficacy or unanticipated consequences of vaccines and the pace of recovery will affect our global operations and sales if these impacts persist worsen or reemerge throughout 2022 and beyond the extent and duration of these impacts on us are dependent in part on demand for our products and services and our ability to meet customer demand customers’ budgets spending willingness to allow us access to their job sites and continuation of planned projects continued funding for infrastructure investments particularly water infrastructure our suppliers’ ability to continue to supply us with parts components and raw materials and logistics providers ability to continue shipment of our products and supplies in a timely manner 

the covid19 pandemic has caused significant volatility and uncertainty in the financial and capital markets a further disruption of global financial markets or resulting economic downturn from the covid19 pandemic or other global health crises may reduce our ability to incur debt or access capital or increase our cost of capital there are no assurances that the credit markets or the capital markets will be available to us in the future or that the lenders participating in our credit facilities will be able to provide financing in accordance with their contractual obligations additionally concerns over the economic impacts of covid19 have caused and may continue to cause volatility in our stock price a sustained downturn may impact our liquidity position including our ability to continue to pay dividends or may impact our asset values resulting in the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets exceeding their fair value which may require us to recognize an impairment to those assets the effects of the covid19 pandemic including remote working arrangements for employees has not to date impacted but could in the future impact our financial reporting systems and internal control over financial reporting 

we cannot reasonably estimate the length or severity of the ongoing covid19 pandemic or the associated macroeconomic impacts including impacts on our markets and other impacts to our business financial position results of operations and cash flows to the extent that covid19 conditions improve the duration and sustainability of such improvements will be uncertain and continuing adverse impacts or the degree of improvement may vary by business andor geography actions we may take in response to improvements in conditions may also vary by business andor geography and may be made with incomplete information there is a risk that such actions could be premature insufficient or incorrect and could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

inflation tariffs customs duties and other increases in manufacturing and operating costs could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations 

our operating costs are subject to fluctuations particularly due to changes in prices for commodities parts raw materials energy and related utilities freight and cost of labor which have been and may continue to be driven by inflation tightening labor markets prevailing price levels exchange rates changes in trade agreements and trade protection measures including tariffs and other economic factors throughout 2021 our operating costs have been impacted by price inflation including with respect to the cost of certain raw materials electronic components commodities freight and logistics and we expect this to continue for the foreseeable future the us has enacted various trade actions including imposing tariffs on certain goods we import from china and other countries which has resulted in retaliatory tariffs by china and other countries additional tariffs imposed by the us or further retaliatory trade measures taken by china or other countries could increase the cost of our products that we may not be able to offset the tca between the uk and eu imposes duties on goods traded between the uk and eu in order to remain competitive we may not be able to recover all or a portion of these higher costs from our customers through price increases further in a declining price environment our operating margins may contract because we account for inventory using the firstin firstout method actions we take to mitigate volatility in manufacturing and operating costs may not be successful and as a result our business financial condition cash flows and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

our business is subject to foreign currency exchange rates fluctuations 

sales outside of the us for the year ended december 31 2021 accounted for approximately 56 of our net sales we also have significant operations in various locations outside of the us we are therefore exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly with respect to the euro swedish krona british pound canadian dollar australian dollar and polish zloty changes in the value of currencies of the countries in which we do business relative to the value of the us dollar or euro could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure which has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows and results of operations additionally we are subject to foreign exchange translation risk due to changes in the value of foreign currencies in relation to our reporting currency the us dollar the 

translation risk is primarily concentrated in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro chinese yuan british pound canadian dollar australian dollar swedish krona and indian rupee as the us dollar fluctuates against other currencies in which we transact business revenue and income may be impacted strengthening of the us dollar relative to the euro and the currencies of the other countries in which we do business has materially and adversely affected and could in the future materially and adversely affect our sales growth and profitability in future periods refer to item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information on foreign exchange risk 

our pension and other defined benefit plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely impact our earnings financial condition and cash flows in future periods 

certain current and retired employees are covered by pension and other defined benefit plans collectively “postretirement benefit plans” we make contributions to fund our postretirement benefit plans when we consider it necessary or advantageous to do so significant changes in market interest rates decreases in fair value of or investment losses on plan assets changes in discount rates or changes in minimum funding requirements established by governments taxing authorities or other agreements could increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our earnings financial condition and cash flows in future periods in addition the cost of our postretirement benefit plans is incurred over long periods of time and involves factors that can be volatile and unpredictable including rates of return on plan assets discount rates used to calculate liabilities and expenses change in laws and regulatory actions and changes in actuarial experience and assumptions which could adversely impact our earnings results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

risks related to our business and operations 

failure to compete successfully in our markets including our ability to develop and commercialize innovative and disruptive technologies could adversely affect our business 

we offer our technologies products and services in highly competitive markets we believe the principal points of competition are product and service performance quality and reliability innovation speed to market with new or disruptive technologies and business models application expertise brand reputation energy efficiency product security product life cycle cost timeliness of delivery proximity of our service centers to customers effectiveness of our distribution channels price and customers’ experience in doing business with us maintaining and improving our competitive position will require successful management of these factors in a business environment with increasingly rapid rates of change and disruption 

our competitive position and future growth rate depend upon a number of factors including our ability to successfully i innovate develop and maintain competitive products services business models and customer experience to address emerging trends and meet customers’ needs including those related to social environmental and sustainability matters ii defend our market share against an everexpanding number of competitors many of which are new and nontraditional competitors from outside our industry such as large technology firms or those out of emerging markets iii enhance our product and service offerings by adding innovative features or disruptive technologies that differentiate them from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization iv develop manufacture and bring compelling new products and services to market quickly and costeffectively v continue to cultivate develop and maintain our distribution network of channel partners vi attract develop and retain individuals with the requisite innovation digital and technical expertise and understanding of customers’ needs to develop and commercialize new technologies products and services vii continue to invest in our manufacturing research and development engineering sales and marketing customer service and support and distribution networks viii win large contracts and ix compete for business subject to applicable governmental procurement laws regulations and policies including new and existing domestic content requirements in the us and globally as they may evolve over time 

we may not be successful in maintaining our competitive position which could adversely affect our business financial condition cash flows or results of operations the failure of our technologies products or services to maintain and gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings or customers’ slowerthanexpected adoption of and investment in our new and innovative technologies could significantly reduce our revenues or market share and adversely affect our competitive position pricing pressures could cause us to adjust the prices of certain products to stay competitive or we may not be able to continue to win large contracts which could adversely affect our market share and competitive position 

cybersecurity incidents or other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure communications networks and operations could adversely affect our business products and services 

our business operations rely on information technology and communications networks some of which are operated by third parties including cloudbased service providers to process transmit and store our electronic information including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personal data relating to employees customers or other business partners we have or operate through a concentration of operations on certain sites such as production and shared service centers with the covid19 pandemic impacting our business since march 2020 a significant portion of our workforce transitioned to remote working which we expect to be the case for the foreseeable future and they are reliant on our information technology infrastructure and communication networks to perform their jobs as well as access to reliable and safe communication networks in their communities we also rely on third parties’ information technology systems to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities including with regard to remote work regardless of protection measures essentially all systems are susceptible to damage disruption or shutdown due to cybersecurity attacks including ransomware denialofservice computer viruses and security breaches equipment or system failure including due to maintenance obsolescence or age and other events or circumstances such as human error or malfeasance vandalism natural disaster fire power communication or other utility outage shutdown or utility failure and other events in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other business continuity and disaster recovery planning and response may be ineffective or inadequate 

in addition we offer certain services and products including pumps controllers and meters that are digitallyenabled or that connect to and are part of the “internet of things” iot and are used by third parties for operational purposes or to collect data cybersecurity attacks may target hardware software and information installed stored or transmitted by our products after they have been purchased and incorporated into third parties’ products facilities or infrastructure while we attempt to provide security measures to safeguard our products and services from cyber threats the potential for an attack remains a successful attack may result in the misappropriation destruction unauthorized access to or disclosure of third parties confidential information damage or disruption to third parties’ operations potentially with personal health and safety risks recall of our products or increased costs for security and remediation as well as damage to our brand reputation 

like many multinational companies we and some third parties upon which we rely have experienced cybersecurity attacks on information technology networks and systems products and services in the past and may experience them in the future likely with more frequency and involving a broader range of devices and modes of attack to date none have resulted in any material adverse impact to our business operations products services or customers we have adopted measures designed to mitigate potential risks associated with cybersecurity threats breaches or other disruptions or damage to our information technology networks and systems products and services but the unpredictability of the timing nature and scope of such disruptions and threats could impact our business operations products and services disruption to information technology and communications networks on which we rely or an attack on our products and services could interfere with our operations disrupt our supply chain and service to our customers interrupt production and shipments result in theft or compromise of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets damage employee customer and business partner relationships negatively impact our reputation result in legal claims and proceedings or regulatory enforcement actions and increase our costs for security and remediation any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

although we continue to assess these risks implement measures to mitigate these risks and perform business continuity and disaster recovery planning we cannot be sure that cybersecurity attacks or other interruptions with material adverse effects will not occur or that our business continuity and disaster recovery efforts will be effective and adequate 

lack of or delay in availability of products parts and raw materials from our supply chain or the inability of suppliers to meet delivery and other requirements could adversely affect our business 

our business relies on a large and complex network of suppliers and their suppliers including contract manufacturing commodity markets and freight and logistics providers to secure and ship finished goods and raw materials parts electronic components and other components that are used in our products we expect that our reliance on and the complexity of the supply chain will continue to increase parts and raw materials commonly used in our products include electronic components particularly semiconductors motors fabricated parts castings bearings seals batteries and pcbs as well as commodities including steel brass nickel copper aluminum and plastics we are exposed to the availability of these parts components materials and finished goods which have been and may in the future be subject to delay curtailment or change due to among other things macroeconomic factors including supply and demand dynamics labor shortages changes in the strategy or production planning of 

suppliers including decisions to exit production of key components upon which we rely interruptions in suppliers production labor disputes the impaired financial condition of a particular supplier suppliers’ capacity allocations to other purchasers changes in trade agreements and trade protection measures including tariffs exchange rates and prevailing price levels ability to meet regulatory requirements weather emergencies and associated effects of climate change the ongoing effects of the covid19 pandemic or other public health crises or threatened or actual armed conflict acts of war or terrorism we have also experienced and continue to experience increased freight and logistics costs delivery delays related to port congestion and other logistics related challenges although we have insurance we cannot be certain that this insurance coverage will continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost or will be adequate to cover any or all aspects of supply chain disruptions 

some of our key components are available only from a sole or single source supplier or a limited group of suppliers and so we are subject to supply and pricing risk in addition if a sole or single source supplier were to cease or interrupt production or otherwise fail to supply a key component to us it could adversely affect our product sales and operating results 

in addition as a result of the ongoing covid19 pandemic and broader global market supply and demand dynamics we have experienced and may continue to experience shortages capacity constraints and delays with respect to the supply of components including electronic components in particular semiconductors and other parts and raw materials we have and continue to take measures including with respect to buffer stock the use of alternative suppliers and redesign of certain products to mitigate the impacts of the ongoing supply chain freight and logistics issues however if these shortages and disruptions continue if additional disruptions occur or if our efforts to mitigate these shortages and disruptions are insufficient or unsuccessful we may be unable to or delayed in our ability to execute on our backlog fill new customer orders or timely deliver products to our customers and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

a material disruption to any of our facilities or operations or that of third parties upon which we rely may adversely affect our business and financial performance 

our facilities and operations rely on a complex global supply chain including suppliers and their suppliers distributors contract manufacturers and freight and logistics providers in addition we rely on certain third parties to supply critical business processes and activities including in the areas of finance human resources procurement and information technology we also have a concentration of operations at certain sites such as production and shared services centers our facilities and operations and those of certain third parties on which we rely have experienced and may in the future experience disruptions as a result of an actual or threatened event or circumstance including due to a significant equipment or system failure natural disaster weather event effects of climate change power water or communications outage fire explosion critical supply chain failure terrorism cybersecurity attack political disruption the effects of covid19 outbreak of an epidemic pandemic or other public health crisis insurrection armed conflict or war labor dispute work stoppage or slowdown technology failure adverse weather conditions or other reason a significant disruption to any of our facilities or operations or that of third parties upon which we rely could cause material adverse impacts to our financial performance operations and business including an inability to meet customer demand or contractual commitments increased costs and reduced sales and could impact our business processes and activities including our ability to timely report financial results any interruption in capability may be lengthy and have lasting effects require a significant amount of management and other employees time and focus and require us to make substantial expenditures to remedy the situation which could negatively affect our operations business processes and activities profitability and financial condition any recovery under our insurance policies may not offset the lost sales increased costs or longer term loss of suppliers sales or customers that we may experience as a result of a disruption which could adversely affect our business financial condition cash flow and results of operations although we continue to assess these risks implement mitigation plans and perform business continuity and disaster recovery planning we cannot be sure that interruptions with material adverse effects on our operational and financial performance will not occur 

failure to retain our existing senior management engineering technology sales services and other key talents or the inability to attract new qualified and diverse talent could negatively impact our business 

our success has depended and will continue to depend to a significant extent on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees in senior management positions and in strategic or core competencies including engineering innovation digital technologies sales excellence service and project management as well as general productionrelated labor the market for highlyskilled talent leaders and labor in our industry is increasingly competitive as a result our success in attracting and retaining employees has depended and will continue to depend on our ability to offer attractive career growth opportunities compensation and benefits particularly in the areas of services digital technologies innovation and data science in addition advancing our culture including with respect to diversity equity and inclusion is critical to attract and retain talent to enable the continued execution of our strategy while driving innovation remaining competitive and creating longterm value we also need to continue to develop qualified talent to support business growth and robust succession plans both of which are 

critical to our longterm success a failure to attract or retain highly engaged and skilled talent and labor could adversely affect our ability to meet and exceed the needs of our customers operate and grow our business and execute our strategy 

our financial results can be difficult to predict 

our business is impacted by a substantial amount of short cycle and bookandbill business which we have limited insight into particularly for the business that we transact through our significant distribution network we are also impacted by our long cycle business including large projects which could be unexpectedly cancelled or whose timing can change based upon customer requirements due to a number of factors affecting the project that are beyond our knowledge or control such as funding readiness of the project and regulatory approvals additionally we rely on a complex global supply chain which has been subject to dynamic conditions unexpected changes and disruptions during 2021 and into 2022 due to macroeconomic factors associated with covid19 these supply chain challenges have affected and may continue to affect our production and ability to timely fill customer orders we cannot predict when or if these conditions will ease or subside in the future accordingly our financial results for any given period have been and will continue to be difficult to predict 

defects unanticipated use or inadequate disclosures with respect to our products could adversely affect our business reputation and financial condition and results of operations 

defects inadequacies or quality issues in the manufacture design software security or service of our products including in products parts or components that we source from third parties unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of our products could result in product safety product security regulatory or environmental risks including personal injury death property or environmental damage these events could also lead to recalls safety or security alerts relating to our products result in the removal of a product from the market andor result in warranty or liability claims against us although we have liability insurance we cannot be certain that this insurance coverage will continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost or will be adequate to cover any or all aspects of liability claims manufacturing design software security or service defects or inadequacies may also result in contractual damages against us warranty expenses or issuance of credits which could impact our profitability recalls removals and warranty liability and quality claims can result in significant costs as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

a significant portion of our products and offerings in our measurement  control solutions segment are affected by the availability regulation of and interference with radio spectrum that we use 

a significant portion of the offerings in our measurement  control solutions segment use radio spectrum which is subject to government regulation to the extent we introduce new products designed for use in the us or another country such products may require significant modification or redesign in order to meet frequency requirements and other regulatory specifications limitations on frequency availability or the cost of making necessary modifications may preclude us from selling our products in certain countries the regulations that govern our use of radio spectrum may change which may require us to modify our products or seek new partnerships either directly or due to interference caused by new consumer products allowed under the regulations the inability to modify our products to meet such requirements the possible delays in completing or the cost of such modifications could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition we may not be able to secure suitable partners for codevelopment of products 

in the us our products are primarily designed to use fcclicensed spectrum in the 900mhz range if the fcc does not renew our existing spectrum licenses or materially changes regulations affecting the use of these licenses our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected in addition there may be insufficient available frequencies in some markets to sustain or develop our planned operations at a commercially feasible price or at all 

outside the us certain of our products require the use of radio frequency and are subject to regulations in some jurisdictions radio station licenses may be granted for a fixed term and must be periodically renewed our advanced and smart metering systems offerings transmit to and receive information from if applicable handheld mobile or fixed network reading devices in licensed bands made available to us through strategic partnerships and are reliant to some extent on the licensed spectrum continuing to be available through our partners or our customers we may be unable to find partners or customers that have access to sufficient frequencies in some markets to sustain or develop our planned operations or to find partners or customers that have access to sufficient frequencies in the relevant markets at a commercially feasible price or at all 

we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring and realignment plans or our restructuring and realignment may adversely affect our business 

in recent fiscal years we initiated restructuring and realignment plans in an effort to optimize our cost structure improve our operational efficiency and effectiveness strengthen our competitive positioning and better serve our customers additionally in 2020 in response to the business and economic conditions resulting from the covid19 pandemic we initiated additional restructuring and realignment activity we are also engaged in a multiyear effort to transform many of our support functions and related technologies including finance human resources and procurement challenges with the enabling technologies and delays in implementing planned restructuring and realignment activities have delayed the realization of some of the expected operational and financial benefits from such actions as such we may not be able to obtain all of the cost savings and benefits that were initially anticipated in connection with our restructuring and realignment plans additionally as a result of these plans we may experience a loss of continuity or accumulated knowledge or inefficiencies during transitional periods and ongoing operations realignment and restructuring require a significant amount of management and other employees time and focus which may divert attention from operating and growing our business 

the successful implementation and execution of our restructuring and realignment actions are critical to achieving our expected cost savings as well as effectively competing in the marketplace and positioning us for future growth factors that may impede a successful implementation include the retention of key employees the impact of regulatory matters including tax matters involving certain thirdparty service providers selected to assist us including staffing technology and compliance of service providers with our internal controls over financial reporting and adverse economic market conditions if our restructuring and realignment actions are not executed successfully it could have material adverse impacts on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting our competitive position business financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

our strategy includes acquisitions and we may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisitions 

as part of our growth strategy we plan to continue to pursue the acquisition of other companies assets technologies product lines and customer channels that complement or expand our existing business or improve our competitive position we may not be able to complete acquisitions with favorable terms or timing or at all or obtain financing that may be needed to consummate acquisitions in addition our results of operations may be adversely impacted by i the failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses into our operations technology and financial and other systems ii the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns which in the past has led to and in the future may lead to accounting impairments iii the discovery of unanticipated liabilities labor relations difficulties cybersecurity concerns control or compliance issues or other issues for which we lack contractual protections insurance or indemnities 

acquisitions involve a number of risks and present financial managerial and operational challenges including diversion of management’s attention from existing businesses and operations insufficient internal controls over financial or compliance activities or financial reporting the failure to realize expected synergies the assumption of new material risks associated with the acquired businesses and the loss of key employees of the acquired businesses failure to successfully execute our growth strategy via acquisitions and successfully integrate these acquisitions could adversely affect our competitive position business financial condition or results of operations 

weather conditions including the effects of climate change and associated efforts by governmental or regulatory authorities to mitigate such effects may cause volatility in our served markets and may affect our businesses operations and financial results 

globally the frequency and severity of severe weather events due to the effects of climate change is increasing and our facilities operations and business face related risks and opportunities the unpredictable nature of weather conditions including heavy flooding water stress due to prolonged droughts and fluctuations in temperatures or weather patterns including as a result of climate change can positively or negatively impact portions of our business for example heavy flooding and rain events attributable to the effects of global climate change may increase customer demand for some of our solutions that help manage water and storm water overflows or remove and transfer excess or unwanted water prolonged drought conditions may increase demand for our pumping technology used in agriculture and turf irrigation applications demand for water reuse applications including those provided by our treatment business may also increase as communities look to address water scarcity challenges due to the effects of climate change in addition fluctuations in temperatures result in varying levels of demand for our products used in residential and commercial hydronic applications where homes and buildings use circulating water to heat and cool living spaces significant fluctuations in these weather conditions and climate changes can therefore result in volatility in our financial results 

severe weather events and other effects of climate change have caused and may in the future cause disruptions to our facilities and operations and those of our customers and suppliers in 2021 a physical risk analysis using the task force on climate related financial disclosures “tcfd” framework indicated that certain of our facilities are at a moderate risk for exposure to water stress coldwave and wildfire impacts due to the effects of climate change while we continue to assess these risks implement mitigation plans and perform business continuity and disaster recovery planning we cannot be sure that disruptions with material adverse effects will not occur 

governments may implement emissions trading schemes carbon taxes fuel taxes and other policies to reduce the impacts of climate change that could impact our business and financial results the timing scope and effect of governments’ implementation of carbon pricing and taxes are uncertain but could significantly increase our expenses in the future and therefore have material adverse impacts on our business financial condition cash flows results of operations and market price of our common stock 

our commitments goals targets objectives and initiatives related to sustainability and our public statements and disclosures regarding them expose us to numerous risks 

we have developed and will continue to establish goals targets and other objectives related to sustainability matters including our sustainability goals as well as commitments to preliminary sciencebased targets aligned to limiting global temperature increase to 15°c above preindustrial level in line with the paris agreement by 2030 and net zero greenhouse gas ghg emissions scope 1 2 and 3 before 2050 achieving these goals and commitments will require evolving our business capital investment and the development of technology that might not currently exist we might incur additional expense or be required to recognize impairment charges in connection with our efforts these commitments goals targets and other objectives reflect our current plans and there is no guarantee that they will be achieved our efforts to research establish accomplish and accurately report on these commitments goals targets and objectives expose us to operational reputational financial legal and other risks our ability to achieve any stated commitment goal target or objective is subject to factors and conditions many of which are outside of our control including the pace of changes in technology the availability of requisite financing and the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability and other standards 

our business may face increased scrutiny from the investment community other stakeholders regulators and the media related to our sustainability activities including our commitments goals targets and objectives and our methodologies and timelines for pursuing them if our sustainability practices do not meet investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards which continue to evolve our reputation our ability to attract or retain employees and our attractiveness as an investment business partner or as an acquiror could be negatively impacted similarly our failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfill our commitments goals targets and objectives to comply with ethical environmental or other standards regulations or expectations or to satisfy reporting standards with respect to these matters within the timelines we announce or at all could have operational reputational financial and legal impacts 

our debt obligations may adversely affect our business and our ability to meet our obligations and pay dividends 

as of december 31 2021 our total outstanding indebtedness was 2440 million as described under “liquidity and capital resources and we may incur additional debt in the future our indebtedness could have adverse consequences to us and our investors including 

• increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

• limiting our ability to obtain additional financing or borrow additional funds 

• reducing or eliminating our ability to pay future dividends or repurchase our common stock 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and industry 

• requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to make principal and interest payments 

• reducing the cash flows available to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or other investments to grow our business 

• increasing the amount of interest expense that we must pay because some of our borrowings are at variable interest rates which as interest rates increase would result in higher interest expense and 

• increasing the risk of a future credit rating downgrade which could increase future debt costs and limit the availability of debt financing 

in addition there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available to us on favorable 

terms or at all for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness the terms of any future debt indentures may also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on our operations than we currently have 

our ability to make scheduled principal payments of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend on our future cash flows from operations which may not be sufficient and may be affected by factors beyond our control if we are unable to service our indebtedness our business financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 

we may incur additional impairment charges for our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets which would negatively impact our operating results 

we have a significant amount of goodwill and purchased intangible assets on our balance sheet as a result of acquisitions as of december 31 2021 the net carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets totaled approximately 3 billion in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we evaluate these assets for impairment at least annually or more frequently if changes in events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that a potential impairment could exist significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business or our customers’ business inability to effectively integrate or scale acquired businesses increases in cost of capital unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets failure of the fcc to renew radio spectrum licenses and divestitures and market capitalization declines may cause impairment of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for example in 2020 we recorded goodwill impairment charges 58 million within our measurement  control solutions segment primarily related to the performance of the business of the pure technologies ltd acquisition pure as detailed in note 12  “goodwill and other intangible assets” we did not record goodwill impairment charges within our measurement  control solutions segment in 2021 material impairment charges have in the past and could in the future adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

risks related to legal regulatory and tax 

failure to comply with laws regulations and policies including the us foreign corrupt practices act other applicable anticorruption laws trade regulations and data privacy and security laws could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition and reputation 

given our global operations we are subject to regulation under a wide variety of us and nonus laws regulations and policies including laws and regulations related to anticorruption trade including export and import compliance antitrust and money laundering our policies mandate compliance with these laws and regulations the us foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa the uk bribery act of 2010 and similar anticorruption laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business we operate in many parts of the world that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption and in certain circumstances strict compliance with anticorruption laws may conflict with local business customs and practices we cannot guarantee that our internal controls policies and procedures will always prevent and protect us from improper conduct of our employees or business partners in the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees or business partners have or may have violated applicable laws regulations or policies including anticorruption laws we are required to investigate the relevant facts and circumstances which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management any such violation could result in substantial fines sanctions civil andor criminal penalties termination of relationships with business partners and curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions and as a result might materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition in addition actual or alleged violations could damage our reputation and ability to do business 

additionally to conduct our operations we regularly move data across borders and consequently we are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations regarding data privacy data protection and data security including the california consumer protection act the eus gdpr and china’s personal information protection law “pipl” the scope of the laws that may be applicable to us is evolving often uncertain and may be conflicting particularly with respect to foreign laws gdpr greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of eu law and adds a broad array of requirements for handling personal data including the enforcement of data subject rights enhanced security requirements obligations to guarantee eu data subject rights are not compromised in countries outside the eu and public disclosure of significant data breaches other countries such as china with its pipl have enacted or are enacting data localization and security laws that require data to stay within their borders all of these evolving legal and operational requirements impose significant costs of compliance that are likely to increase over time in addition any such violation could result in substantial fines sanctions andor civil penalties damage to our reputation and might materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

changes in our effective tax rates and tax expenses may adversely affect our financial results 

we sell our products in approximately 150 countries and 56 of our revenue was generated outside the us in 2021 given the global nature of our business a number of factors may increase our effective tax rates and tax expense including 

• the geographic mix of jurisdictions in which profits are earned and taxed 

• the statutory tax rates and tax laws in jurisdictions in which we conduct business 

• the resolution of tax issues arising from tax examinations by various tax authorities and 

• the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities 

additionally tax laws regulations and administrative practices in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change with or without notice due to economic political and other conditions and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes the recent agreement by countries in the organization for economic cooperation and development to implement additional legislative changes increases the uncertainty of future income tax positions and such changes may result in additional tax expense and effective tax rate volatility 

our businesses are regularly examined by various tax authorities throughout the world and the resolutions of these examinations do not typically have a significant impact on our effective tax rates and tax expenses but they could for example following an examination regarding aspects of the reorganization of our european business that occurred in 2013 the swedish tax authority issued a tax assessment to xylem’s swedish subsidiary in 2019 which we are appealing as further described in note 7 “income taxes” this examination as well as other examinations can result in increased tax assessments and settlement or litigation about the assessments and final resolution could be unfavorable to xylem we regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes including unrecognized tax benefits however developments in an audit or litigation could materially and adversely affect us although we believe our tax estimates and accruals are reasonable there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in its historical income tax provisions accruals and unrecognized tax benefits which could materially and adversely affect our business operating results cash flows and financial condition 

we face risks related to legal and regulatory proceedings 

we are subject to various laws regulations and other requirements of government authorities in the us and foreign countries any violation of which could potentially create substantial liability for us and damage our reputation changes in laws ordinances regulations or other government policies the nature timing and effect of which are uncertain may significantly increase our expenses and liabilities 

from time to time we are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings that are incidental to the operation of our businesses or the business operations of previouslyowned entities these proceedings may seek remedies relating to environmental matters tax intellectual property acquisitions or divestitures product liability property damage personal injury privacy employment labor and pensions government contract issues and commercial or contractual disputes our continued transition to connected and digital technologies and solutions has increased our exposure to intellectual property litigation and we expect that this risk will continue to increase as we execute on our innovation and technology priorities 

it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of claims investigations regulatory proceedings and lawsuits and we could in the future incur judgments fines or penalties or enter into settlements and claims that could have an adverse effect on our reputation our business results of operations and financial condition additionally we may be required to change or cease operations at one or more facilities if a regulatory agency determines that we have failed to comply with laws regulations or orders applicable to our business 

the global and diverse nature of our operations coupled with the increase in regulation and enforcement in many regions of the globe means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal and regulatory proceedings and other contingencies the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty will arise from time to time in addition subsequent developments in legal and regulatory proceedings may affect our assessments and estimates of loss contingencies recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments in excess of our reserves which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

infringement or expiration of our intellectual property rights or allegations that we have infringed upon the intellectual property rights of third parties could negatively affect us 

we own numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others that are important to our business our intellectual property rights may provide us with competitive advantage because they may help us differentiate our technologies products and services including our growing portfolio of data analytics and digitallyenabled offerings however our current or future intellectual property rights may not be sufficiently broad or may be challenged invalidated circumvented misappropriated independently developed or designedaround particularly given our operations in countries where laws governing intellectual property rights are not highly developed protected or enforced our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention misappropriation or unauthorized use of such property as well as the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we receive notices from third parties alleging intellectual property infringement or misappropriation any dispute or litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming to defend due to the complexity and uncertainty of intellectual property litigation we may not be successful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation in addition as a result of such claims of infringement or misappropriation we could lose our rights to use critical technology be unable to license critical technology or sell critical products and services be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the use of thirdparty intellectual property rights or be required to redesign our products at substantial cost any of which could adversely impact our competitive position financial condition and results of operations even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation we may incur significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

developments in and compliance with current and future environmental and climate change laws and regulations could impact our business financial condition or results of operations 

our business operations and product and service offerings are subject to and affected by many federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations including those enacted in response to climate change concerns 

increasing public and governmental awareness and concern regarding the effects of climate change has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions and will likely result in further environmental and climate change laws and regulations compliance with existing laws and regulations currently requires and compliance with future laws is expected to continue to require increasing operating and capital expenditures including with respect to the design or redesign of our products in order to conform to changing environmental standards and regulations which could impact our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore environmental laws and regulations may authorize substantial fines and criminal sanctions as well as facility shutdowns to address violations and may require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit emissions or discharges we also incur and expect to continue to incur costs to comply with current environmental laws and regulations developments such as the adoption of new environmental laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations violations by us of such laws and regulations discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination litigation involving environmental impacts our inability to recover costs associated with any such developments or financial insolvency of other responsible parties could in the future have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

our spinoff from itt corporation may expose us to potential liabilities 

pursuant to the distribution agreement and certain other agreements with itt now itt llc acquired by delticus holdco lp a portfolio company of warburg pincus llc on july 1 2021 and exelis acquired by harris corporation now l3harris technologies inc itt and exelis agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities and we agreed to indemnify itt and exelis for certain liabilities indemnities that we may be required to provide itt and exelis may be significant and could negatively impact our business third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that itt or exelis agreed to retain further there can be no assurance that the indemnities from itt and exelis will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities or that itt and exelis will be able to fully satisfy their indemnification obligations moreover even if we ultimately were to succeed in recovering from itt and exelis any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves each of these risks could negatively affect our business results of operations cash flow and financial condition

covid19 pandemic update 

the global spread of covid19 has curtailed the movement of people goods and services worldwide including in many of the regions where we sell our products and services and conduct operations 

this section summarizes the most significant impacts related to the covid19 pandemic that we have experienced to date and we have included additional details as applicable throughout other sections of this annual report xylem’s covid19 response team is responsible for xylems pandemic plan the pandemic plan is designed to aid in prevention preparedness response and recovery at our sites and across the company 

given the magnitude and duration of the covid19 pandemic and its economic consequences it has become more difficult to distinguish specific aspects of our operational and financial performance that are most directly related to the pandemic from those more broadly influenced by ongoing macroeconomic market and industry dynamics that may be to varying degrees related to the pandemic and its consequences 

public health officials have recommended or governments have mandated precautions to mitigate the spread of covid19 including travel restrictions quarantine guidelines or similar measures in many of the areas in which we operate as a result a number of our production facilities across the globe experienced reduced production levels due to such measures to varying degrees during the year however our current overall operating capacity approximates normal levels globally in order to maintain a safe work environment our production facilities continue to spread operations over multiple shifts and implement other protective measures such as testing temperature screening and social distancing while maintaining operational capabilities 

the covid19 pandemic as well as broader global market supply and demand dynamics have adversely affected and are expected to continue to adversely affect our supply chains we have experienced and expect to continue experiencing shortages in the supply of components including electronics particularly semiconductors chips parts and raw materials we have also experienced and continue to experience increased inflation freight and logistics costs issues with port congestion delivery delays and labor to help mitigate the effects of these challenges and increase the resilience of our supply chain we continue to enhance and augment our risk management activities including supplier pulsing and redundancy additionally we have and continue to take measures with respect to buffer stock the use of alternative suppliers or redesign of certain products to mitigate the impacts of the ongoing supply chain freight and logistics delays and bolster our access to electronics parts and raw materials to some extent we have been able to pass cost increases through to customers if these shortages and interruptions continue or if additional interruptions occur they could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

these supply chain issues have also impacted our delivery times to customers to some extent mitigation strategies have alleviated these issues but our lead times continue to be impacted 

we have seen a recovery in demand for our products at the end of 2021 total backlog increased 526 as compared to december 31 2020 the severity magnitude and duration of the covid19 pandemic and its economic consequences are uncertain and the pandemic’s ongoing and future impacts on our business financial condition results of operations and stock price remain uncertain and difficult to predict 

in response to the changes in business and economic conditions arising as a result of the covid19 pandemic management committed to restructuring activities across our businesses and functions globally during the second quarter of 2020 these initiatives were designed to support our longterm financial resilience and simplify our operations strengthen our competitive positioning and better serve our customers since the pandemic started xylem has taken measures to protect the health and safety of our employees work with our customers to minimize potential disruptions and positively impact our communities in the first quarter of 2020 we implemented a support pay program for employees impacted by covid19 which is in place through the second quarter of 2022 and will be evaluated for continuation as necessary 

xylem watermark our corporate social responsibility program continues to support our communities in addressing the challenges posed by this global pandemic by strengthening access to water sanitation and hygiene wash facilities in schools and health centers through its partnership with americares and unicef as well as the partner community grants program and matching donations program for employees and partners and other philanthropic commitments 

many of our offices globally remain in a substantially remote work from home status with no material disruption to operations financial reporting systems internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures our covid19 response team applies a set of health and safety guidelines for employees working in xylem offices 

we continue to assess the evolving nature of the pandemic and its possible implications to our business employees supply chain customers and communities and to take actions in an effort to mitigate adverse consequences 

risks related to the impacts of covid19 as well as our supply chain are described in further detail under item 1a risk factors in the companys 2021 annual report 

key performance indicators and nongaap measures

executive summary 

xylem reported revenue of 5195 million for 2021 an increase of 319 million or 65 from 4876 million reported in 2020 on a constant currency basis revenue increased by 197 million or 40 during the year the increase at constant currency was driven by an increase in organic revenue of 210 million reflecting strong organic growth in the industrial commercial and residential end markets partially offset by organic declines in utilities largely as a result of component shortages in our measurement  controls solutions segment 

operating income for 2021 was 585 million reflecting an increase of 218 million or 594 compared to 367 million in 2020 operating margin was 113 for 2021 versus 75 for 2020 an increase of 380 basis points operating margin benefited from decreases in special charges of 77 million and decreases in restructuring and realignment costs of 55 million during the year excluding the impact of these items adjusted operating income was 611 million with an adjusted operating margin of 118 in 2021 as compared to adjusted operating income of 525 million with an adjusted operating margin of 108 in 2020 an increase of 100 basis points the increase in adjusted operating margin was primarily due to cost reductions from our productivity restructuring and other cost saving initiatives favorable volume and price realization these impacts were partially offset by cost inflation and increased spending on strategic investments 

additional financial highlights for 2021 include the following 

• net income of 427 million or 235 per diluted share 452 million or 249 per diluted share on an adjusted basis up 209 from 2020 

• net cash provided by operating activities of 538 million and free cash flow of 330 million down 49 from 2020

• dividends paid to shareholders increased 8 in 2021 

2022 business outlook 

we anticipate total revenue growth in the range of 1 to 3 in 2022 with organic revenue growth anticipated to be in the range of 3 to 5 the following is a summary of our 2021 organic revenue performance and 2022 organic revenue outlook by end market 

• utilities revenue decreased by approximately 3 for 2021 on an organic basis driven by weakness in united states partially offset by strength in western europe with relatively flat growth in the emerging markets for 2022 we expect organic revenue growth in the lowsingledigit range as utilities remain 

focused on missioncritical applications we expect uneven growth from china and india as multiyear government funding programs are deployed the timing of large clean water utility project deployments has been impacted by the global shortage of electronic components we anticipate that these deployments will ramp up when supply constraints ease in the second half of 2022 based on our strong backlog position and orders momentum additionally we expect healthy momentum in the global test and treatment markets with rising demand and focus on pipeline assessment services and increased demand for our smart water solution and digital offerings 

• industrial revenue increased by approximately 14 for 2021 on an organic basis driven by strength across all major geographic regions for 2022 we expect organic revenue growth in the midsingledigit range as activity rebounds globally we continue to see healthy growth in our dewatering business especially in the emerging markets from mining demand as well as in the us and europe reflecting our strong orders and backlog 

• in the commercial markets organic revenue in 2021 increased by approximately 7 driven across all major geographic regions for 2022 we expect organic revenue growth in the midsingledigit range we expect continued solid replacement business in the us and an acceleration of construction activity in europe we expect modest share gains with demand for ecofriendly products supported by increase in funding for green buildings 

• in residential markets organic revenue increased by approximately 10 in 2021 driven by strength across all major geographic regions this market is primarily driven by replacement revenue serviced through our distribution network for 2022 we expect organic revenue growth in the lowsingledigit to midsingledigit range we anticipate demand and activity to moderate and remain healthy from increased residential users in the us and western europe additionally we continue to anticipate strong demand in china for secondary water supply product applications 

we will continue to strategically execute restructuring and realignment actions in an effort to optimize our cost structure improve our operational efficiency and effectiveness strengthen our competitive positioning and better serve our customers during 2021 we incurred 6 million and 16 million in restructuring and realignment costs respectively we realized approximately 33 million of incremental net savings in 2021 from actions initiated in 2020 and an additional 2 million of net savings from our 2021 actions as a result of our 2020 and 2021 actions we expect to realize approximately 8 million of incremental net savings in 2022 and beyond during 2022 we currently expect to incur between 25 million and 30 million in restructuring and realignment costs 

we plan to continue to take actions and focus spending in 2022 on areas that allow us to make progress on our strategic priorities as well on our top priorities for 2022 which include converting our strong demand momentum into topline growth by maximizing chip allocation and price realization continuing our commitment to deliver margin expansion by mitigating supply chain and inflation headwinds and executing on strategic capital deployment opportunities

the following table illustrates the impact from organic growth recent acquisitions and divestitures and foreign currency translation in relation to revenue during 2021 



a foreign currency translation impact for the year primarily due to the strengthening in value of various currencies against the us dollar the largest being the euro the chinese yuan the british pound the australian dollar and the canadian dollar

from an application perspective organic revenue growth was driven by our transport applications the transport applications had strong dewatering revenue growth across the emerging markets where we experienced market recovery from covid19 impacts and strength in mining and growth from aftermarket parts and services revenue in western europe transport growth in these regions was partially offset by weakness in the us driven by declines in the dewatering construction market organic revenue from our treatment applications also contributed to the segments growth during the year driven by market recovery in western europe and project orders in the emerging markets which were partially offset by the timing of project deliveries latin america

measurement  control solutions revenue decreased 28 million or 21 in 2021 37 decrease on a constant currency basis compared to 2020 revenue benefited from 23 million of foreign currency translation during the year with the change at constant currency driven by an organic decline of 38 million or 28 and to a lesser extent 13 million of reduced revenue related to divestiture impacts during the year organic weakness for the year was driven by declines in the utility end market primarily in north america partially offset by modest strength in western europe and the emerging markets strength in the industrial end market across all major geographies partially offset revenue declines in the segment 

in order to simplify and focus the application discussion beginning with the first quarter of 2021 have been aggregating the test application into the water application and the software as a service and other application into the water and energy applications as applicable as both of these subapplications provide products and services to the broader ultimate applications of water and energy from an application perspective organic revenue decline during the year was driven by declines in the electric business within the energy application in north america due to electronic component shortages the water application had modest organic growth in western europe largely attributable to our test business and growth in the emerging markets this growth was largely offset by declines in our metrology business in the us due to deployment constraints as a result of chip shortages 

ordersbacklog 

an order represents a legally enforceable written document that includes the scope of work or services to be performed or equipment to be supplied to a customer the corresponding price and the expected delivery date for the applicable products or services to be provided an order often takes the form of a customer purchase order or a signed quote from a xylem business orders received during 2021 increased by 1267 million or 252 to 6300 million 224 increase on a constant currency basis order intake during the year benefited from 140 million of foreign currency translation the increase on a constant currency basis primarily consisted of organic order growth of 1139 million or 226 over the prior year 

the following table illustrates the impact from organic growth recent acquisitions and divestitures and foreign currency translation in relation to orders during 2021 



a foreign currency translation impact for the year primarily due to the strengthening in value of various currencies against the us dollar the largest being the euro the chinese yuan the british pound the australian dollar and the canadian dollar 

water infrastructure 

water infrastructure segment orders increased 337 million or 158 to 2471 million 122 increase on a constant currency basis order intake during the year benefited from 76 million of foreign currency translation the order increase on a constant currency basis consisted of organic order growth in both the transport and treatment applications organic growth in the transport application was driven by healthy market conditions in the us and strong order intake in western europe as well as increased demand for dewatering applications in the emerging markets organic orders for the treatment application also increased during the year due to strong order intake in the first half of the year driven by strength in the us and western europe 

applied water 

applied water segment orders increased 377 million or 254 to 1860 million 228 increase on a constant currency bases order intake during the year benefited from 39 million of foreign currency translation the order increase on a constant currency basis was driven by organic order growth in the us across all end markets and applications where we benefited from strong demand amplified by early ordering to mitigate longer lead times as well as strength in the specialty flow control applications in western europe where we benefited from strong order intake and in the emerging markets driven by china as markets conditions recovered from the covid19 pandemic 

measurement  control solutions 

measurement  control solutions segment orders increased 553 million or 391 to 1969 million 373 increase on a constant currency basis order intake during the year benefited from 25 million of foreign currency translation the order increase on a constant currency basis included organic order growth of 540 million or 381 which was partially offset by a 12 million reduction in orders related to divestiture impacts during the year organic order growth was led by the water application primarily in our metrology business but also from our test business order intake in the energy application also grew organically during the year where the electric and gas businesses benefited from covid19 recovery coupled with increased order intake due to the known chip shortages 

backlog 

backlog includes orders on hand as well as contractual customer agreements at the end of the period delivery schedules vary from customer to customer based on their requirements annual or multiyear contracts are subject to rescheduling and cancellation by customers due to the longterm nature of the contracts as such beginning total backlog plus orders minus revenues will not equal ending total backlog due to contract adjustments foreign currency fluctuations and other factors typically large projects require longer lead production cycles and deployment schedules and delays occur from time to time total backlog was 3240 million at december 31 2021 and 2124 million at december 31 2020 an increase of 526 we anticipate that approximately 60 of our total backlog at december 31 2021 will be recognized as revenue during 2022 

gross margin 

gross margin as a percentage of consolidated revenue increased 50 basis points to 380 in 2021 as compared to 375 in 2020 the gross margin increase for the year was primarily driven by cost reductions from our productivity restructuring and other cost saving initiatives price realization and favorable volume partially offset by inflation 

operating expenses 



selling general and administrative sga expenses 

sga expenses increased by 36 million increase of 31 to 227 of revenue in 2021 as compared to 234 of revenue in 2020 revenue growth was higher than sga increases resulting in a lower sga as a percentage of sales cost increases were driven by increased investments in strategic growth initiatives and inflation partially offset by cost reductions from our productivity restructuring and other cost saving initiatives 

research and development rd expenses 

rd expense was 204 million or 39 of revenue in 2021 as compared to 187 million or 38 of revenue in 2020 the increase in rd as a percent of revenue for year was primarily driven by the companys continued focus on strategic investments during the year 

restructuring and asset impairment charges 

restructuring 

in response to the changes in business and economic conditions arising as a result of the covid19 pandemic on june 2 2020 management committed to a restructuring plan that includes actions across our businesses and functions globally the plan was designed to support our longterm financial resilience and simplify our operations strengthen our competitive positioning and better serve our customers 

as a result of this action during 2021 we recognized restructuring charges of 4 million and 2 million in our water infrastructure and applied water segments respectively these charges included reduction of headcount across both segments other less significant restructuring actions taken in 2021 resulted in 3 million of charges during 2021 and are included in the information presented below 

as a result of this action during 2020 we recognized restructuring charges of 19 million 4 million and 30 million in our water infrastructure applied water and measurement  control solutions segments respectively these charges included reduction of headcount across all segments and asset impairments within our measurement  control solutions segment immaterial restructuring charges incurred during the first quarter of 2020 are included in the 2020 plan information presented below 

the following is a rollforward of employee position eliminations associated with restructuring activities for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 



the following table presents the total costs expected to be incurred the amount incurred in the period and the cumulative costs incurred to date for our 2020 and 2021 restructuring actions 



during the third quarter of 2021 we recorded an adjustment of 3 million to decrease the liability within the measurement  control solutions segment related to actions commenced in 2019 as a result of this adjustment the estimated total cost of the actions commenced in 2019 decreased to 24 million for the measurement  control solutions segment the actions commenced in 2019 are complete 

the water infrastructure and measurement  control solutions actions commenced in 2021 consist primarily of severance charges these actions are expected to continue through the end of 2022 

the water infrastructure applied water and measurement  control solutions actions commenced in 2020 consist primarily of severance charges across segments and asset impairment charges in our measurement  control solutions segment these actions are complete 

during the second quarter of 2020 the discontinuance of a product line resulted in 17 million of asset impairments primarily related to customer relationships trademarks and fixed assets within our measurement  control solutions segment 

as a result of the actions initiated in 2021 we achieved savings of approximately 1 million in 2021 and estimate annual future net savings beginning in 2022 of approximately 2 million resulting in 1 million of incremental savings from 2021 actions 

asset impairment 

during the second and third quarters of 2020 we determined that certain assets within our measurement  control solutions segment including software proprietary technology and internally developed inprocess software were impaired accordingly we recognized impairment charges of 21 million during the year refer to note 12 goodwill and other intangible assets for additional information 

goodwill impairment charge 

during the third quarter of 2020 the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 58 million related to the advanced infrastructure analytics “aia” goodwill reporting unit within our measurement  control solutions segment the aia goodwill reporting unit is comprised of our assessment services business primarily the pure acquisition as well as our decision intelligence solutions business the impairment resulted from managements updated forecast of future cash flows for the aia businesses which reflected significant negative volume impacts primarily on our assessment services business due to travel restrictions and site closures as a result of the covid19 pandemic these factors drove a decrease in the fair value based on a discounted cash flow valuation 

of the aia goodwill reporting unit that was below its carrying value requiring an impairment charge refer to note 12 goodwill and other intangible assets for additional information 

operating income and adjusted ebitda 

operating income was 585 million operating margin of 113 during 2021 an increase of 218 million or 594 when compared to operating income of 367 million operating margin of 75 during the prior year operating margin benefited from decreases in special charges of 77 million and decreases in restructuring and realignment costs of 55 million as compared to the prior year excluding these special charges and restructuring and realignment costs adjusted operating income was 611 million adjusted operating margin of 118 for 2021 as compared to adjusted operating income of 525 million adjusted operating margin of 108 during the prior year the increase in adjusted operating margin was primarily due to cost reductions from our productivity restructuring and other cost saving initiatives favorable volume and price realization these impacts were partially offset by cost inflation and increased spending on strategic investments 

adjusted ebitda was 890 million adjusted ebitda margin of 171 during 2021 an increase of 95 million or 119 when compared to adjusted ebitda of 795 million adjusted ebitda margin of 163 during the prior year the increase in adjusted ebitda margin was primarily due to the same factors impacting operating margin noted above 

the table below provides a reconciliation of total and each segments operating income to adjusted operating income and a calculation of the corresponding adjusted operating margin 



nm not meaningful 

the table below provides a reconciliation of total and each segments adjusted ebitda to consolidated ebitda and net income 







water infrastructure 

operating income for our water infrastructure segment increased 69 million or 217 during 2021 as compared to the prior year with operating margin also increasing from 153 to 172 operating margin benefited from a decrease in restructuring and realignment costs of 16 million in 2021 excluding these restructuring and realignment costs adjusted operating income increased 53 million or 153 with adjusted operating margin increasing from 166 to 178 the increase in adjusted operating margin during the year was primarily due to cost reductions from our productivity restructuring and other cost saving initiatives and favorable volume these impacts were partially offset by cost inflation and increased spending on strategic investments 

adjusted ebitda was 447 million adjusted ebitda margin of 199 during 2021 an increase of 52 million or 13 when compared to adjusted ebitda of 395 million adjusted ebitda margin of 190 during the prior year the increase in adjusted ebitda margin was primarily due to the same factors impacting the increase in adjusted operating margin however adjusted ebitda margin did not benefit from the year over year reduction in depreciation and amortization expense 

applied water 

operating income for our applied water segment increased 35 million or 171 during 2021 as compared to the prior year with operating margin also increasing from 143 to 149 operating margin benefited from a decrease in restructuring and realignment costs of 2 million in 2021 partially offset by an increase in special charges of 1 million excluding these items adjusted operating income increased 34 million or 159 with adjusted operating margin increasing from 149 to 154 the increase in adjusted operating margin during the year was primarily due to cost reductions from our productivity restructuring and other cost saving initiatives favorable volume and price realization these impacts were partially offset by cost inflation and increased logistics cost increased spending on strategic investments increased inventory management costs 

adjusted ebitda was 271 million adjusted ebitda margin of 168 during 2021 an increase of 31 million or 13 when compared to adjusted ebitda of 240 million adjusted ebitda margin of 167 during the prior year the increase in adjusted ebitda margin was primarily due to the same factors impacting the increase in adjusted operating margin however adjusted ebitda margin did not benefit from the year over year reduction in depreciation and amortization expense 

measurement  control solutions 

operating income for our measurement  control solutions segment increased 118 million or 1113 during 2021 as compared to the prior year resulting in an operating income of 12 million with operating margin increasing from 78 to 09 operating margin benefited from a decrease in special charges of 79 million and a decrease in restructuring and realignment costs of 37 million in 2021 excluding these items adjusted operating income increased 2 million or 154 with adjusted operating margin increasing from 10 to 11 the increase in adjusted operating margin during the year was driven by cost reductions from our productivity restructuring and other cost saving initiatives and improved quality management costs primarily due to a specific warranty charge recorded during the prior year that did not recur related to a firmware issue that was identified and addressed timely these impacts were partially offset by cost inflation unfavorable volume and increased spending on strategic investments 

adjusted ebitda was 164 million adjusted ebitda margin of 123 during 2021 an increase of 5 million or 3 when compared to adjusted ebitda of 159 million adjusted ebitda margin of 117 during the prior year the increase in adjusted ebitda margin was due to the same factors as those impacting the increase in adjusted operating margin however year over year increases in depreciation and amortization did not negatively impact adjusted ebitda margin 

corporate and other 

operating loss for corporate and other increased 4 million or 80 compared to the prior year the increase in cost is primarily driven by increased spending on strategic initiatives 

interest expense 

interest expense was 76 million and 77 million for 2021 and 2020 respectively the decrease in interest expense reflects the settlement of our senior notes due 2021 and lower short term borrowings during 2021 partially offset by a full year of interest expense associated with our green bond issuance during the second quarter of 2020 as defined in funding and liquidity strategy see note 15 credit facilities and debt of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our credit facilities and longterm debt and related interest 

income tax expense 

the income tax provision for 2021 was 84 million at an effective tax rate of 163 as compared to 31 million at an effective tax rate of 109 in 2020 the 2021 effective tax rate differs from that of 2020 primarily due to the tax benefits recorded for releases of uncertain tax positions in 2020 in addition in 2021 the company recorded a lower tax benefit for excess stock compensation deductions 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash 



a 2021 impact is primarily due to weakening of the euro and chilean peso against the us dollar 

sources and uses of liquidity 

operating activities 

during 2021 net cash provided by operating activities was 538 million compared to 824 million in 2020 the 286 million yearoveryear decrease was primarily driven by higher working capital levels impacted by increased safety stock to mitigate supply chain volatility also contributing to the decrease were higher interest payments and increased cash used for income payroll and other taxes partially from the delayed timing of payments in the prior year related to covid19 tax relief programs increased cash earnings partially offset these items 

investing activities 

cash used in investing activities was 183 million in 2021 compared to 169 million in 2020 this increase in cash used of 14 million was mainly driven by higher spending on capital expenditures compared to the prior year partially offset by proceeds received from the sales of businesses in 2021 

financing activities 

cash used in financing activities was 855 million in 2021 compared to cash generated from financing activities of 473 million in 2020 this change was primarily driven by the repayment of senior notes in 2021 and proceeds received from the issuance of our green bond as defined in funding and liquidity strategy and other shortterm financings in 2020 that did not reoccur in 2021 partially offsetting these items was the repayment of shortterm debt in 2020 

funding and liquidity strategy 

our ability to fund our capital needs depends on our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access to bank financing and the capital markets we continually evaluate aspects of our spending including capital expenditures strategic investments and dividends 

in both 2021 and 2020 we elected to utilize certain federal state and foreign covid19 tax relief programs related to timing of tax payments deductions and credits to further manage our liquidity 

historically we have generated operating cash flow sufficient to fund our primary cash needs xylem issued senior notes of 1 billion in aggregate principal green bond on june 26 2020 to further manage our liquidity the primary longterm intention of incurring this debt is to fund green projects across our business segments as well as manage liquidity risk and increase flexibility as the duration of the economic effects of the pandemic are uncertain see note 15 credit facilities and debt of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our credit facilities and longterm debt xylems liquidity position has continued to evolve favorably during 2021 and we will continue to monitor the economic effects of the covid19 pandemic and its impact on the companys future operating cash flows going forward if our cash flows from operations are less than we expect we may need to incur debt or issue equity from time to time we may need to access the longterm and shortterm capital markets to obtain financing our access to and the availability of financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors including i our credit ratings or absence of a credit rating ii the liquidity of the overall capital markets and iii the current state of the economy there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or that such financing will be available at all our securities are rated investment grade a significant change in credit rating could impact our ability to borrow at favorable rates refer to note 15 credit facilities and debt of our consolidated financial statements for a description of limitations on obtaining additional funding 

we monitor our global funding requirements and seek to meet our liquidity needs on a costeffective basis as of december 31 2021 the covid19 pandemic has not materially impacted our borrowing costs or other costs of capital however the future impact of the covid19 pandemic is uncertain and may increase our borrowing costs and other costs of capital and otherwise adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we have considered the impacts of the covid19 pandemic on our liquidity and capital resources and do not currently expect them to impact our ability to meet future liquidity needs or continue to comply with debt covenants to provide for continued access to the full capacity of our credit facilities going forward xylem entered into amendment no 1 to the 2019 credit facility as defined in note 15 credit facilities and debt on june 22 2020 which modified the covenant calculation methodology through the quarter ending september 30 2021 and restricted stock repurchases until march 31 2021 except for shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued after the date of the amendment subject to customary exceptions see note 15 credit facilities and debt of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our credit facilities and longterm debt 

based on our current global cash positions cash flows from operations and access to the capital markets we believe there is sufficient liquidity to meet our funding requirements and service debt and other obligations in both the us and outside of the us over the next 12 months in addition we believe our existing committed credit facilities and access to the public debt markets would provide further liquidity if required currently we have available liquidity of approximately 21 billion consisting of 13 billion of cash and 800 million of available credit facilities as disclosed in note 15 credit facilities and debt of our consolidated financial statements our debt repayment obligations in 2021 consisted of 600 million in senior notes which we paid out of cash our next longterm debt maturity is march 2023 

risk related to these items are described in our risk factor disclosures referenced under “item 1a risk factors 

contractual obligations 

material contractual obligations arising in the normal course of business primarily consist of debt obligations and related interest payments lease obligations and unconditional purchase obligations refer note 15 “credit facilities and debt” and note 11 “leases” of the consolidated financial statements for related to these matters 

the company has future unconditional purchase commitments which are legally binding and that specify all significant terms including price andor quantity total future commitments within the next twelve months for these obligations is 326 million excluding contracts that can be canceled without penalty 

credit facilities  longterm contractual commitments 

see note 15 credit facilities and debt of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our credit facilities and longterm debt 

nonus operations 

for 2021 and 2020 we generated 56 and 53 of our revenue from nonus operations respectively as we continue to grow our operations in the emerging markets and elsewhere outside of the us we expect to continue to generate significant revenue from nonus operations and expect that a substantial portion of our cash will be predominately held by our foreign subsidiaries we expect to manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed we may transfer cash from certain international subsidiaries to the us and other international subsidiaries when we believe it is costeffective to do so we continually review our domestic and foreign cash profile expected future cash generation and investment opportunities and reassess whether there is a need to repatriate funds held internationally to support our us operations as of december 31 2021 we have provided a deferred tax liability of 4 million for net foreign withholding taxes and state income taxes on 591 million of earnings expected to be repatriated to the us parent as deemed necessary in the future 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we are a party to certain offbalance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees for discussion of these arrangements see note 20 “commitments and contingencies” of the consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 

significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are discussed in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” of the consolidated financial statements accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they are inherently uncertain involve significant judgments include areas where different estimates reasonably could have been used and changes in the estimates that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable however actual results in these areas could differ from management’s estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

revenue recognition xylem recognizes revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of promised goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which it expects to be entitled for providing those goods and services for each arrangement with a customer we identify the contract and the associated performance obligations within the contract determine the transaction price of that contract allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation and recognize revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied 

the satisfaction of performance obligations in a contract is based upon when the customer obtains control over the asset depending on the nature of the performance obligation control transfers either at a particular point in time or over time which determines the recognition pattern of revenue 

for product sales other than longterm constructiontype contracts we recognize revenue once control has passed at a point in time which is generally when products are shipped in instances where contractual terms include a provision for customer acceptance revenue is recognized when either i we have previously demonstrated that the product meets the specified criteria based on either seller or customerspecified objective criteria or ii upon formal acceptance received from the customer where the product has not been previously demonstrated to meet customerspecified objective criteria we recognize revenue on product sales to channel partners including resellers distributors or valueadded solution providers at the point in time when the risks and rewards possession and title have transferred to the customer which usually occurs at the point of delivery 

revenue from performance obligations related to services is primarily recognized over time as the performance obligations are satisfied in these instances the customer consumes the benefit of the service as xylem performs 

certain businesses also enter into longterm constructiontype sales contracts where revenue is recognized over time in these instances revenue is recognized using a measure of progress that applies an input method based on costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs we also recognize revenue for certain of these arrangements using the output method and measure progress based on shipments of product where control has transferred to the customer 

for all contracts with customers we determine the transaction price in the arrangement and allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation identified in the contract judgment is required to determine the appropriate unit of account and we separate out the performance obligations if they are capable of being distinct and are distinct within the context of the contract the transaction price is adjusted for our estimate of variable consideration which may include a right of return discounts rebates penalties and retainage to estimate variable consideration we apply the expected value or the most likely amount method based on whichever method most appropriately predicts the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to the method applied is typically based on historical experience and known trends we constrain the amounts of variable consideration that are included in the transaction price to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur or when uncertainties around the variable consideration are resolved 

income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities applying enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences will reverse based on the evaluation of available evidence we recognize future tax benefits such as net operating loss carryforwards to the extent that we believe it is more likely than not we will realize these benefits we periodically assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets and reflect any changes to our estimate of the amount we are more likely than not to realize in the valuation allowance with a corresponding adjustment to earnings or other comprehensive income as appropriate 

in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we look to the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences taxable income in carryback years and the feasibility of tax planning strategies and estimated future taxable income the valuation allowance can be affected by changes to tax laws changes to statutory tax rates and changes to future taxable income estimates 

we have recorded net foreign withholding taxes and state income taxes on earnings that are expected to be repatriated to the us parent we have not recorded any deferred taxes on the amounts that the company currently does not intend to repatriate the determination of deferred taxes on this amount is not practicable 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due furthermore we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if based on the technical merits of the position it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities or upon completion of the litigation process the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 

we adjust our liability for uncertain tax positions in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional tax expense would result if a payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 

business combinations we record acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting all of the assets acquired liabilities assumed contractual contingencies and contingent consideration is recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill the application of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in order to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill these assumptions and estimates include a market participant’s use of the asset and the appropriate discount rates for a market participant our estimates are based on historical experience information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and when appropriate includes assistance from independent thirdparty appraisal firms significant assumptions and estimates include but are not limited to the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future the cost to buildrecreate certain technology the appropriate weightedaverage cost of capital and the cost savings 

expected to be derived from acquiring an asset these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable in addition unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates 

goodwill and intangible assets we review goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable we also review the carrying value of our finitelived intangible assets for potential impairment when impairment indicators arise we conduct our annual impairment test as of the first day of the fourth quarter for goodwill the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is not impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value then an impairment charge is recognized for that excess up to the amount of recorded goodwill we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using an income approach we estimate the fair value of our intangible assets with indefinite lives using either the income approach or the market approach under the income approach we calculate fair value based on the present value of estimated future cash flows under the market approach we calculate fair value based on recent sales and selling prices of similar assets 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinitelived intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions particularly related to future operating results and cash flows these estimates and assumptions include but are not limited to revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates assumed royalty rates future economic and market conditions and identification of appropriate market comparable data in addition the identification of reporting units and the allocation of assets and liabilities to the reporting units when determining the carrying value of each reporting unit also require judgment goodwill is tested for impairment at either the operating segment identified in note 22 “segment and geographic data” of the consolidated financial statements or one level below the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets is based on estimates and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable significant changes to these estimates and assumptions could adversely impact our conclusions actual future results may differ from those estimates 

in the third quarter of 2020 management updated forecasts of future cash flows for the aia businesses which reflected significant negative volume impacts from the covid19 pandemic primarily on our assessment services business our ongoing investment in the aia businesses also continues to impact near term profitability based on these factors we determined that there were indicators that the aia reporting unit’s goodwill may be impaired and accordingly we performed an interim goodwill impairment test as of july 1 2020 the results of the impairment test showed that the fair value of the aia reporting unit was lower than the carrying value resulting in a 58 million goodwill impairment charge as of december 31 2020 the remaining goodwill balance in our aia reporting unit after recording the goodwill impairment charge was 113 million 

also during the third quarter of 2020 due to the factors discussed above we assessed whether the carrying amounts of the aia reporting unit’s longlived assets may not be recoverable and therefore impaired our assessment resulted in an impairment charge of 11 million primarily related to software and proprietary technology the charge was calculated using an income approach 

the risks and potential impacts of covid19 on the fair value of our assets are included in our risk factor disclosures referenced under “item 1a risk factors 

during the fourth quarter of 2021 we performed our annual impairment assessment and determined that the estimated fair values of our goodwill reporting units were substantially in excess of each of their carrying values however future goodwill impairment tests could result in a charge to earnings we will continue to evaluate goodwill on an annual basis as of the beginning of our fourth quarter and whenever events and changes in circumstances require us to do so we determined that no impairment of the indefinitelived intangibles existed as of the measurement date in 2021 however future indefinitelived intangible impairment tests could result in a charge to earnings we will continue to evaluate indefinitelived intangibles on an annual basis as of the beginning of our fourth quarter and whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate there may be a potential impairment 

postretirement benefit plans company employees around the world participate in numerous defined benefit plans the determination of projected benefit obligations and the recognition of expenses related to these plans are dependent on various assumptions these major assumptions primarily relate to discount rates expected longterm rates of return on plan assets rate of future compensation increases mortality years of service and other factors some of which are disclosed in note 16 “postretirement benefit plans” of the consolidated financial statements actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized on a straightline basis only to the extent they exceed 10 of the higher of the marketrelated value or projected benefit obligation over the average remaining service period of active plan participants or for plans with all or substantially all inactive participants over 

the average remaining life expectancy 

significant assumptions 

management develops each assumption using relevant company experience in conjunction with marketrelated data for each individual country in which such plans exist all assumptions are reviewed annually with thirdparty consultants and are adjusted as necessary the table below provides the weighted average assumptions used to estimate our defined benefit pension obligations and costs as of and for the years ended 2021 and 2020 



nm not meaningful the pension benefits for future service for all the us pension plans are based on years of service and not impacted by future compensation increases 

we determine the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets by evaluating both historical returns and estimates of future returns specifically the company analyzes the estimated future returns based on independent estimates of asset class returns and evaluates historical broad market returns over longterm timeframes based on the strategic asset allocation which is detailed in note 16 “postretirement benefit plans” of the consolidated financial statements 

based on the approach described above the chart below shows weighted average actual returns versus the weighted average expected longterm rates of return for our pension plans that were utilized in the calculation of the net periodic pension cost for each respective year 



for the recognition of net periodic pension cost the calculation of the expected return on plan assets is generally derived by applying the expected longterm rate of return to the marketrelated value of plan assets the marketrelated value of plan assets is based on average asset values at the measurement date over the last five years the use of fair value rather than a calculated value could materially affect net periodic pension cost the weighted average expected longterm rate of return for all of our plan assets to be used in determining net periodic benefit costs for 2022 is estimated at 322 we estimate that every 25 basis point change in the expected return on plan assets impacts the expense by 1 million 

the discount rate reflects our expectation of the present value of expected future cash payments for benefits at the measurement date a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense we base the discount rate assumption on current investment yields of highquality fixed income investments during the retirement benefits maturity period the pension discount rate was determined by considering an interest rate yield curve comprising aaaaa bonds with maturities between zero and 30 years developed by the plan’s actuaries annual benefit payments are then discounted to present value using this yield curve to develop a singlepoint discount rate matching the plan’s characteristics our weighted average discount rate for all pension plans effective january 1 2022 is 171 we estimate that every 25 basis point change in the discount rate impacts the expense b y 1 million 

the rate of future compensation increase assumption reflects our longterm actual experience and future and nearterm outlook effective january 1 2022 our expected rate of future compensation is 296 for all pension plans the estimated impact of a 25 basis point change in the expected rate of future compensation is less than 1 million 

the company has initiated the process for a full buyout of its largest defined benefit plan in the uk upon completion of the buyout expected in 2022 we anticipate a settlement charge of approximately 170 million primarily consisting of unrecognized actuarial losses 

we currently anticipate making contributions to our pension and postretirement benefit plans in the range of 19 million to 27 million during 2022 approximately 6 million of contributions are expected to be made in the first quarter 

funded status 

funded status is derived by subtracting the respective yearend values of the projected benefit obligations from the fair value of plan assets we estimate that every 25 basis point change in the discount rate impacts the funded status by approximately 34 million 

fair value of plan assets 

the plan assets of our pension plans comprise a broad range of investments including domestic and foreign equity securities interests in hedge funds fixed income investments insurance contracts and cash and cash equivalents 

a portion of our pension benefit plan assets portfolio comprises investments in hedge funds which are generally measured at net asset value however in certain instances the values reported by the asset managers were not current at the measurement date accordingly we made estimate adjustments to the last reported value where necessary to measure the assets at fair value at the measurement date these adjustments consider information received from the asset managers as well as general market information the adjustment recorded at december 31 2021 and 2020 for these assets represented less than 1 of total plan assets in each respective year asset values for other positions were generally measured using market observable prices we estimate that a 5 change in asset values will impact funded status by approximately 31 million

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates these exposures are actively monitored by management our exposure to foreign exchange rate risk is due to certain costs revenue and borrowings being denominated in currencies other than one of our subsidiaries functional currency similarly we are exposed to market risk as a result of changes in interest rates which may affect the cost of our financing it is our policy and practice to use derivative financial instruments only to the extent necessary to manage exposures 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

approximately 56 of our 2021 revenues were from customers in various locations outside the us 

our economic foreign currency risk primarily relates to receipts from customers payments to suppliers and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies we may use derivative financial instruments to offset risk related to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers when it is believed that the exposure will not be limited by our normal operating and financing activities we enter into currency forward contracts periodically in order to manage the exchange rate fluctuation risk on certain intercompany transactions associated with thirdparty sales and purchases these risks are also mitigated by natural hedges including the presence of manufacturing facilities outside the us global sourcing and other spending which occurs in foreign countries our principal foreign currency transaction exposures primarily relate to the euro swedish krona british pound canadian dollar australian dollar and polish zloty we estimate that a hypothetical 10 movement in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material economic impact to xylem’s financial position and results of operations 

additionally we are subject to foreign exchange translation risk due to changes in the value of foreign currencies in relation to our reporting currency the us dollar the translation risk is primarily concentrated in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro chinese yuan british pound canadian dollar australian dollar swedish krona and indian rupee as the us dollar strengthens against other currencies in which we transact business revenue and income will generally be negatively impacted and if the us dollar weakens revenue and income will generally be positively impacted we expect to continue to generate significant revenue from nonus operations and we expect our cash will be predominately held by our foreign subsidiaries we expect to manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed we may transfer cash from certain international subsidiaries to the us and other international subsidiaries when it is costeffective to do so though we continually review our domestic and foreign cash profile expected future cash generation and investment opportunities and reassess whether there is a need to repatriate funds held internationally to support our us operations we also hedge our investment in certain foreign subsidiaries via the use of crosscurrency swaps and the designation of our 225 senior notes of €500 million aggregate principal amount due march 2023 as a net investment hedge accordingly we estimate that a 10 movement of the us dollar to various foreign currency exchange rates we translate from in aggregate would not have a material economic impact on our financial position and results of operations 

interest rate risk 

as of december 31 2021 our longterm debt portfolio is primarily comprised of five series of fixedrate senior notes that total approximately 25 billion the senior notes are not exposed to interest rate risk as the bonds are at a fixed rate until maturity based on the current interest rate market we do not anticipate material risk associated with our debt refinancing within the target time frame of maturity

business segments distribution and competitive landscape 

we have t hree reportable business segments that are aligned around the critical market applications they provide water infrastructure applied water and measurement  control solutions see note 22 “segment and geographic data” in our consolidated financial statements for financial information about segments and geographic areas 

the table and descriptions below provide an overview of our business segments 



a building services application revenue is composed of approximately 70 of commercial end market sales and approximately 30 of residential end market sales 

water infrastructure 

our water infrastructure segment primarily supports the process that collects water from a source treats it and distributes it to users and then treats and returns the wastewater responsibly to the environment through two closely linked applications transport and treatment the transport application also includes sales and rental of specialty dewatering pumps and related equipment and services which provide the safe removal or draining of groundwater and surface water from construction sites or other industrial sites and bypass pumping for the repair of aging utility infrastructure as well as emergency water transport and removal during severe weather events 

the customer base consists of two primary end markets utility and industrial the utility market includes public private and publicprivate entities that support water wastewater and storm water networks the industrial market includes customers who require similar water and wastewater infrastructure networks to support various industrial operations 

water infrastructure sells primarily through direct channels with remaining sales through indirect channels and service capabilities both utility and industrial facility customers increasingly require our teams’ global but locally 

proficient expertise to use our equipment in their specific applications several trends are increasing demand for this application expertise i the increase in both the type and amount of contaminants found in the water supply ii increasing environmental regulations iii the need to increase system efficiencies and resilience to optimize energy and other operational costs iv the retirement of an aging water industry workforce that has not been systematically renewed at utilities and other enduser customers and v the buildout of water infrastructure in the emerging markets we estimate our served market size in this sector to be approximately 20 billion 

given the highly fragmented nature of the water industry the water infrastructure segment competes with a large number of businesses and no one business competes across all the markets water infrastructure serves we differentiate ourselves in the market by focusing on product and service performance quality and reliability innovation speed to market with new or disruptive technologies and business models application expertise brand reputation energy efficiency product security product lifecycle cost timeliness of delivery proximity of service centers effectiveness of our distribution channels price and customers experience in doing business with us increasingly digital solutions and analytics are important competitive differentiators we are actively expanding our capabilities in these areas and integrating them together with our legacy technologies and service offerings as well as capabilities from other xylem business units to present ever more compelling solutions to our customers in the sale or rental of products and provision of services we benefit from our large installed base which requires maintenance repair and replacement parts due to the critical application and nature of the products and the conditions under which they operate timeliness of delivery quality and the proximity of service centers are important customer considerations when selecting a provider for aftermarket products and services as well as equipment rentals in geographic regions where we are locally positioned to provide a quick response customers have historically relied on us rather than our competitors for aftermarket products relating to our highly engineered and customized solutions our key competitors in the water infrastructure segment include ksb inc sulzer ltd evoqua water technologies united rentals trojan danaher corporation and grundfos among others 

applied water 

applied water encompasses the uses of water in two primary applications building services and industrial water these applications serve a diverse set of customers in the commercial residential and industrial end markets residential consumers represent the end users in the residential market while owners and managers of properties such as apartment buildings retail stores institutional buildings restaurants schools hospitals and hotels are examples of end users in the commercial market the industrial market includes oems exploration and production firms and developers and managers of industrial facilities such as electrical power generators chemical manufacturers machine shops clothing manufacturers marine food and beverage companies and car washes 

in the applied water segment end markets vary widely and as a result specialized distribution partners are often preferred as such the applied water segment provides the majority of its sales through strong indirect channels with the remaining sales going through our global direct sales channels we have longstanding relationships with many of the leading independent distributors in the markets we serve and we provide incentives to distributors such as specialized loyalty and training programs 

we estimate our served market size in this sector to be approximately 20 billion population growth urbanization and regulatory requirements are macro growth drivers of these markets driving the need for housing food community services and retail goods within growing city centers 

competition in the applied water segment focuses on brand reputation application expertise product delivery performance and energy efficiency quality and reliability and price we compete by offering a wide variety of innovative and highquality products coupled with worldclass application expertise we believe our distribution through wellestablished channels and our reputation for quality significantly enhance our market position our ability to deliver innovative product offerings has enabled us to compete effectively to cultivate and maintain customer relationships and to serve and expand into many niche and new markets our key competitors in the applied water segment include grundfos wilo se pentair plc and franklin electric co inc 

measurement  control solutions 

measurement  control solutions develops advanced technology solutions that enable intelligent use and conservation of critical water and energy resources the segment delivers communications smart metering measurement and control technologies and critical infrastructure technologies that allow customers to more effectively use their distribution networks for the delivery monitoring and control of critical resources such as water electricity and natural gas we also provide analytical instrumentation used to measure and analyze water quality flow and level in clean water wastewater surface water and coastal environments additionally we offer 

software and services including cloudbased analytics remote monitoring and data management leak detection condition assessment asset management and pressure monitoring solutions 

at the heart of our leading technologies are automation data management and decision support communications networks enable customers to automate and optimize meter reading bill customers monitor flow rates and detect and enable rapid response to changing and unsafe conditions in short they provide insight into operations and enable our customers to manage the entire scope of their operations remotely through their networks at the center of our offering is the flexnet communication network which provides a common communications platform and infrastructure for essential metering services this twoway communication technology remotely connects a wide variety of smart points in a given network with protocols frequently on federal communications commission fcc licensed spectrum in the us to enable reliable resilient and secure transmissions these technologies allow our customers to remotely and continuously monitor their water energy distribution infrastructure prioritize and manage maintenance and use data to optimize many aspects of their networks our advanced infrastructure analytics platform complements these offerings with intelligent solutions that help utility decisionmakers manage and maintain their networks more effectively in real time 

the majority of our sales in the us are conducted through strong longstanding relationships with leading distributors and dedicated channel partners for the water and energy markets internationally direct sales are often made in markets without established distribution channels however some distribution channels are used in more developed markets a more direct sales approach with key account management is employed for large utilities and government programs 

we estimate our served market size in this sector to be approximately 20 billion macro growth drivers include increasing regulation aging infrastructure and worldwide movement towards smart grid implementation water scarcity and conservation as well as the need to prevent revenue loss via inaccurate meter readings leaks or theft are among the drivers of smart meter and leak detection technologies 

our sensusbranded meters are well positioned in the smart metering sector the fastest growing sector of the global meter industry we set ourselves apart in the industry by focusing on our communication network innovation new product development and service offerings that deliver tangible savings of nonrevenue water through improved meter accuracy reduced theft and identification of leaks our pure technologies equipment and services are also well positioned in the leak detection sector which is attracting considerable attention as aging infrastructure and increased regulatory scrutiny exert pressure on operating budgets our key competitors in the measurement  control solutions segment include itron badger meter landisgyr neptune roper elster honeywell echologics mueller water products hach danaher corporation and teledyne 

geographic profile 

the table below illustrates the annual revenue and percentage of revenue by geographic area for each of the three years ended december 31 



in addition to the traditional markets of the us and western europe opportunities in emerging markets within asia pacific eastern europe latin america and other countries are growing revenue derived from emerging markets comprised approximately 19 of total revenue in 2020 and 20 of total revenue in both 2019 and 2018 

supply and seasonality 

we have a global manufacturing and assembly footprint with production facilities in europe north america latin america asia and the middle east our inventory management and distribution practices seek to minimize inventory holding periods by striving to take delivery of the inventory and manufacturing as close as possible to the sale or distribution of products to our customers all of our businesses require various parts and raw materials the availability and prices of which may fluctuate parts and raw materials commonly used in our products include motors fabricated parts castings bearings seals batteries printed circuit boards pcbs and electronic 

components as well as commodities including steel brass nickel copper aluminum and plastics while we may recover some cost increases through operational improvements we are still exposed to pricing risk including due to duty and tariff assessments by the us or other governments on foreign imports we attempt to control costs through fixedpriced contracts with suppliers and various other programs such as our global procurement initiative 

our business relies on thirdparty suppliers contract manufacturing and commodity markets to secure raw materials parts and components used in our products we typically acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our materials requirements for many of our products we have existing alternate sources of supply or such sources may be readily available 

we may experience price volatility or supply constraints for materials that are not available from multiple sources from time to time we acquire certain inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longerterm pricing commitments with suppliers to improve the priority price and availability of supply there have been no raw material shortages in the past several years that have had a significant adverse impact on our business as a whole 

our business segments experience a modest level of seasonality in their operations this seasonality is dependent on factors such as customers capital spending as well as the effects of climate change and weather conditions including heavy flooding prolonged droughts and fluctuations in temperatures or weather patterns all of which can positively or negatively impact portions of our business 

customers 

our business is not dependent on any single customer or a few customers the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our company no individual customer accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated revenues in 2020 2019 or 2018 

backlog 

backlog includes orders on hand as well as contractual customer agreements at the end of the period delivery schedules vary from customer to customer based on their requirements annual or multiyear contracts are subject to rescheduling and cancellation by customers due to the longterm nature of the contracts as such beginning total backlog plus orders minus revenues will not equal ending total backlog due to contract adjustments foreign currency fluctuations and other factors typically large projects require longer lead production cycles and deployment schedules and delays can occur from time to time total backlog was 2124 million at december 31 2020 and 1801 million at december 31 2019 we anticipate that approximately 55 of the backlog at december 31 2020 will be recognized as revenue during 2021 

research and development 

research and development “rd” is a key foundation of our growth strategy and we focus on the design and development of products and application knowhow that anticipate customer needs and emerging trends our engineers are involved in new product development as well as improvement of existing products to increase customer value our businesses invest substantial resources into rd we anticipate we will continue to develop and invest in our rd capabilities to promote a steady flow of innovative highquality and reliable products and integrated solutions to further strengthen our position in the markets we serve in addition to investments made in software development which were capitalized we incurred 187 million 191 million and 189 million as a result of rd investment spending in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

we have rd and product development capabilities around the world rd activities are initially conducted in our technology centers located in conjunction with some of our major manufacturing facilities to enable an efficient and robust development process we have several global technical centers and local development teams around the world where we are supporting global needs and accelerating the customization of our products and solutions to address local needs in some cases our rd activities are conducted at our piloting and testing facilities and at strategic customer sites these piloting and testing facilities enable us to serve our strategic markets globally as part of expanding our bandwidth and to increase our access to technology we have built innovation ecosystem partnerships with academic institutions startup accelerators and venture capital organizations 

capitalized software 

we offer software as a product or service directly to external customers which is included within other intangible assets net on our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2020 and 2019 we had net capitalized software used in sales and services to external customers of 182 million and 165 million respectively 

intellectual property 

we generally seek patent protection for those inventions and improvements that we believe will improve our competitive position and are not suitable to be kept as a trade secret we believe that our patents and applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and improving our return on rd investments while we own control or license a significant number of patents trade secrets proprietary information trademarks trade names copyrights and other intellectual property rights which in the aggregate are of material importance to our business management believes that our business as a whole as well as each of our core business segments is not materially dependent on any one intellectual property right or related group of such rights 

patents patent applications and license agreements expire or terminate over time by operation of law in accordance with their terms or otherwise as the portfolio of our patents patent applications and license agreements has evolved over time we do not expect the expiration of any specific patent to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

governmental regulations 

environmental regulations 

our global operations are subject to various laws and regulations governing the environment and climate change such as those promulgated by the us environmental protection agency and similar state and foreign environmental agencies including the discharge of pollutants and the management and disposal of hazardous substances while environmental and climate change laws and regulations are subject to change such changes can be difficult to predict reliably and the timing of potential changes is uncertain management does not believe based on current circumstances that compliance costs pursuant to such regulations will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations however the effect of future legislative or regulatory changes could be material to our financial condition or results of operations 

we continue to be dedicated to environmental and sustainability programs to minimize the use of natural resources reduce the utilization and generation of hazardous materials from our processes and remediate identified environmental concerns we are currently engaged in site investigations and remediation activities to address environmental cleanup from past operations at a number of current and former manufacturing facilities we do not anticipate these liabilities will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations at december 31 2020 we had estimated and accrued 3 million related to environmental matters 

other regulations 

as a company with global operations we are subject to complex us federal state and local and foreign laws and regulations in the countries where we conduct business including with respect to trade such as tariffs imports and exports antibribery and corruption antitrust and competition data security and privacy such as the eu general data protection regulation “gdpr” use of regulated radio spectrum including that of the us fcc lobbying activity health and safety and the environment among other matters we have policies and procedures in place to promote compliance with these laws and regulations additional information about the impact of government regulations on xylem’s business is included in item 1a “risk factors” under the headings risks related to our business and operations and risks related to legal regulatory and tax 

sustainability 

at xylem sustainability is at the center of who we are and what we do as a leading global water technology company we address some of the world’s most urgent sustainability challenges  responsible stewardship of our shared water resources and resiliency of communities to climate change technology is playing an increasingly important role in helping the world solve water issues we have a long history of innovation and we are focusing on the powerful capabilities of smart technology integrated management and data analytics 

we believe our financial performance and commitment to sustainability go hand in hand xylem approaches business sustainability as a way to generate economic value while also creating value for society thus meeting the needs of both accordingly in 2019 we evolved our approach to leverage sustainability in our decisionmaking toward longterm value for our shareholders customers employees and communities in which we operate and announced an ambitious new slate of 2025 sustainability goals these new goals can be found in our 2019 sustainability report which is aligned to the global reporting initiative and the sustainability accounting standards board frameworks 

in setting our 2025 sustainability goals we also aligned them with the united nations sustainable development goals unsdgs not only to substantiate our contribution to achieving global objectives but also to be 

transparent in our communication to stakeholders by providing details on our responsibility to build a sustainable future while xylem embraces all 17 of the unsdgs we have a special focus on sdg6 clean water and sanitation 

in 2020 xylem completed a 1 billion green bond offering in senior unsecured notes consisting of 500 million of 1950 senior notes due in january 2028 and 500 million of 2250 senior notes due in january 2031 the proceeds of this offering are funding green projects that help improve water accessibility water affordability and water systems resilience 

human capital 

our employees around the globe are united in a shared purpose – to solve water – and as such are key to the company’s success and strategy 

as of december 31 2020 xylem employed approximately 16700 employees worldwide of which approximately 1100 were temporary or fixedterm employees or interns we have approximately 5500 employees in the us of which approximately 17 are represented by labor unions in certain foreign countries our employees are represented by work councils we believe that our facilities are in favorable labor markets with ready access to adequate numbers of workers and believe our relations with our employees are good 

the safety and health of our employees is our highest priority we have a strong environmental health and safety program that focuses on governance risk reduction and education to provide our employees with safe and healthy workplaces importantly during 2020 and in response to the covid19 pandemic we took additional measures to protect the health safety and wellbeing of our employees including a support pay program for employees impacted by the pandemic an essential services support pay program for employees whose roles were classified as an “essential service” requiring work onsite at a xylem facility or in the field supporting customers and the transition of officebased employees to remote workfromhome status where possible which enabled us to minimize disruptions to our operations and continue to support our customers in addition our leadership team held listening sessions with employees who were also caregivers to understand their unique challenges and evolve our support accordingly

 item 1a risk factors 

in evaluating our business and investment in our securities investors should carefully consider the following discussion of material factors and events along with all of the other information in this report and in our other filings with the sec the events and consequences discussed below could in circumstances that we may not be able to accurately predict recognize or control have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows results of operations or market price of our common stock 

these risk factors do not identify all of the risks we face our business is also subject to general risks that affect many other companies in addition we operate in a continually changing business economic and geopolitical environment and as a result new risk factors may emerge from time to time risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may impact our business operations financial condition or share price the global economic and geopolitical climate including the impacts of the covid19 pandemic amplifies many of the risks below 

risks related to macroeconomic and industry factors 

industry and economic conditions may adversely affect our markets and our customers’ operating conditions which can in turn affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

with sales in over 150 countries we compete in a wide range of geographic and product markets material economic and industry factors impacting our businesses include the overall strength of and our customers’ confidence in local and global macroeconomic conditions industrial and private sector spending federal state local and municipal governmental fiscal trade and procurement policies strength of the residential and commercial real estate markets the availability of commercial financing for our customers and endusers and the degree of funding for our public sector customers including with respect to water infrastructure investments the downturn in the global economy due to the impacts of covid19 has and continues to have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations future slowdowns or prolonged downturns in the global economy or our markets could have material adverse effects on our business financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

we are exposed to geopolitical regulatory economic foreign exchange and other risks associated with our global sales and operations 

in 2020 47 of our total revenue was from customers within the us and 53 was from customers outside the us we expect our sales from international operations and export sales to continue to be a significant portion of our revenue many of our manufacturing operations employees and suppliers are located outside of the us our operations and sales both within the us and internationally are subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business globally including 

• changes in trade protection measures including embargoes tariffs and other trade barriers and import and export regulations and licensing requirements 

• instability and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical environment including economic nationalism populism protectionism and antiglobal sentiment 

• changes in tax laws and potential negative consequences from the interpretation application and enforcement by governmental tax authorities of tax laws and policies 

• unanticipated changes in other laws and regulations or how such provisions are interpreted or administered 

• disruptions in our global supply chain 

• unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations including those related to infrastructure and data transmission security and privacy 

• shocks to the global financial system including due to global health crises the effects of climate change or due to idiosyncratic events such as a terrorist attack 

• theft compromise or misappropriation of technology or intellectual property 

• foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations restrictions on repatriation of earnings or payment of distributions dividends loans or advances to us by foreign subsidiaries 

• disruption of operations from labor or political disturbances 

• regional safety and security considerations 

• the transition away from benchmark reference rates based on market participant judgments such as libor and euribor to rates based on observable transactions such as the secured overnight financing rate 

• increased costs and risks in developing staffing and simultaneously managing a number of global operations as a result of distance remote work arrangements language and cultural differences and 

• threat outbreak uncertainty or escalation of political instability insurrection armed conflict terrorism global health crises or pandemics or war 

additionally we continue to monitor the impacts of the uk’s exit from the eu “brexit” on our supply chain operations and financial results the uk and the eu concluded a trade and cooperation agreement “tca” that has been provisionally applied since january 1 2021 pending ratification by the eu parliament the tca creates a number of risks and uncertainties for our businesses it provides for duties on goods traded between the uk and eu including a preferential treatment provision for no duties on goods that meet certain origin criteria our businesses may not be able to benefit from the preferential treatment provision given the origin of certain components used in the manufacture of our products and related certification requirements the tca does not specify rules for trade in services and as such our services are subject to the world trade organization’s rules until the parties to the tca resolve this trade issue there is also uncertainty as to whether the eu parliament will ratify the tca amend or reject it in its entirety in addition the new trading relationship between the uk and eu has increased and will continue to increase our costs including for transportation and duties on products not otherwise eligible for preferential treatment under the tca we have experienced and may continue to experience shipping delays given the need for customs inspections and other procedures at the border including with respect to requirements to mitigate the risks of covid19 volatility in foreign currencies and other markets may also arise as the uk and eu work through the tca or other new trade arrangements additionally once the tca is formalized there could be other nearor longterm negative impacts the uk will also need to negotiate its own trade treaties with countries around the world which could take years to complete and any disagreements on trade terms could result in supply chain delays or other disruptions as a result we face continued uncertainty and risks of disruptions in our supply chain and increased costs 

in the year ended december 31 2020 19 of our total revenues were generated in emerging markets and we have placed a particular emphasis on increasing our growth and presence in emerging markets beyond the general risks that we face outside the us our operations in emerging markets could involve additional uncertainties including risks that governments may impose withholding or other taxes on remittances and other payments to us or the amount of any such taxes may increase governments may seek to nationalize our assets or governments may impose or increase investment barriers or other restrictions affecting our business in addition emerging markets pose other uncertainties including the difficulty of enforcing agreements challenges collecting receivables protecting our intellectual property and other assets pressure on the pricing of our products and services higher business conduct risks and the ability to hire and retain qualified talent we cannot predict the impact such events might have on our business financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

the covid19 pandemic has adversely impacted and continues to pose risks to our business results of operations and financial condition the nature and extent of which are highly uncertain and unpredictable 

our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises including epidemics and pandemics the covid19 pandemic has had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our employees customers supply chain operations and sales the global spread of the covid19 pandemic has and continues to curtail the movement of people goods and services worldwide including in many of the regions where we sell our products and services and conduct operations governmentmandated precautions to mitigate the spread of covid19 including travel restrictions quarantines stay at home or similar measures in many of the areas in which we operate resulted in temporary production impacts at several of our facilities in 2020 curtailed and continues to curtail the business and operations of some of our customers and suppliers and also impacted and continues to impact our ability to access our customers’ sites if the covid19 pandemic continues or worsens including mutations of the virus we may experience a continued decline in sales and customer orders in certain of our businesses the covid19 pandemic also has and continues to impact our supply chain with unpredictable disruptions capacity constraints or delays in shipment of materials necessary to the manufacture of our products while we have taken reasonable measures to mitigate these impacts as the pandemic continues or if it worsens our manufacturing facilities and supply chain may continue to be significantly impacted accordingly the pandemic has negatively impacted our revenue growth in certain of our businesses it is uncertain how materially the covid19 pandemic including any mutations of the virus the corresponding rollout efficacy or unanticipated consequences of such vaccines and the pace of recovery will affect our global operations and sales if these impacts persist worsen or reemerge throughout 2021 and beyond the extent and duration of these impacts on us are dependent in part on demand for our products and services customers’ budgets spending willingness to allow 

us access to their job sites and continuation of planned projects continued funding for infrastructure investments particularly water infrastructure our suppliers’ ability to continue to supply us with parts components and raw materials and logistics providers ability to continue shipment of our products and supplies 

the covid19 pandemic has caused significant volatility and uncertainty in the financial and capital markets a further disruption of global financial markets or resulting economic downturn from the covid19 pandemic or other global health crises may reduce our ability to incur debt or access capital or increase our cost of capital there are no assurances that the credit markets or the capital markets will be available to us in the future or that the lenders participating our credit facilities will be able to provide financing in accordance with their contractual obligations additionally concerns over the economic impacts of covid19 have caused and may continue to cause volatility in our stock price a sustained downturn may impact our liquidity position including our ability to continue to pay dividends or may impact our asset values resulting in the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets exceeding their fair value which may require us to recognize an impairment to those assets the effects of the covid19 pandemic including remote working arrangements for employees has not to date but could in the future impact our financial reporting systems and internal control over financial reporting 

we cannot reasonably estimate the length or severity of the covid19 pandemic or the associated economic downturn impacts on our markets and other impacts to our business financial position results of operations and cash flows to the extent that covid19 conditions improve the duration and sustainability of such improvements will be uncertain and continuing adverse impacts or the degree of improvement may vary by business andor geography actions we may take in response to improvements in conditions may also vary by business andor geography and may be made with incomplete information there is a risk that such actions could be premature insufficient or incorrect and could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

inflation tariffs customs duties and other increases in manufacturing and operating costs could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations 

our operating costs are subject to fluctuations particularly due to changes in prices for commodities parts raw materials energy and related utilities freight and cost of labor which may be driven by inflation prevailing price levels exchange rates changes in trade agreements and trade protection measures including tariffs and other economic factors our operating costs have in the past and may continue to be impacted by price inflation including in 2021 with respect to the cost of certain commodities freight and logistics the us has enacted various trade actions including imposing tariffs on certain goods we import from china and other countries which has resulted in retaliatory tariffs by china and other countries additional tariffs imposed by the us or further retaliatory trade measures taken by china or other countries could increase the cost of our products that we may not be able to offset the tca between the uk and eu which has been provisionally applied since january 1 2021 pending ratification by the eu parliament imposes duties on goods traded between the uk and eu in order to remain competitive we may not be able to recover all or a portion of these higher costs from our customers through product price increases further in a declining price environment our operating margins may contract because we account for inventory using the firstin firstout method actions we take to mitigate volatility in manufacturing and operating costs may not be successful and as a result our financial condition cash flows and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

our business is subject to foreign currency exchange rates fluctuations 

sales outside of the us for the year ended december 31 2020 accounted for approximately 53 of our net sales we also have significant operations in various locations outside of the us we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency transaction exchange rates particularly with respect to the euro swedish krona polish zloty canadian dollar british pound and australian dollar changes in the value of currencies of the countries in which we do business relative to the value of the us dollar or euro could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations additionally we are subject to foreign exchange translation risk due to changes in the value of foreign currencies in relation to our reporting currency the us dollar the translation risk is primarily concentrated in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro chinese yuan british pound canadian dollar australian dollar and swedish krona as the us dollar fluctuates against other currencies in which we transact business revenue and income can be impacted strengthening of the us dollar relative to the euro and the currencies of the other countries in which we do business could materially and adversely affect our sales growth in future periods refer to item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information on foreign exchange risk 

our pension and other defined benefit plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely impact our earnings and cash flows in future periods 

certain current and retired employees are covered by pension and other defined benefit plans collectively “postretirement benefit plans” we make contributions to fund our postretirement benefit plans when we consider it necessary or advantageous to do so significant changes in market interest rates decreases in fair value of or investment losses on plan assets changes in discount rates or changes in minimum funding requirements established by governments taxing authorities or other agreement could increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our financial condition and cash flows in future periods in addition the cost of our postretirement benefit plans is incurred over long periods of time and involves factors that can be volatile and unpredictable including rates of return on plan assets discount rates used to calculate liabilities and expenses change in laws and regulatory actions rates of future compensation increases and changes in actuarial experience and assumptions which could adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

risks related to our business and operations 

failure to compete successfully in our markets including our ability to develop innovative and disruptive technologies could adversely affect our business 

we offer our technologies products and services in highly competitive markets we believe the principal points of competition are product and service performance quality and reliability innovation speed to market with new or disruptive technologies and business models application expertise brand reputation energy efficiency product security product life cycle cost timeliness of delivery proximity of our service centers effectiveness of our distribution channels price and customers’ experience in doing business with us maintaining and improving our competitive position will require successful management of these factors in a business environment with increasingly rapid rates of change and disruption 

our competitive position and future growth rate depend upon a number of factors including our ability to successfully i innovate develop and maintain competitive products services business models and customer experience to address emerging trends and meet customers’ needs ii defend our market share against an everexpanding number of competitors many of which are new and nontraditional competitors from outside our industry such as large technology firms or those out of emerging markets iii enhance our product and service offerings by adding innovative features or disruptive technologies that differentiate them from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization iv develop manufacture and bring compelling new products and services to market quickly and costeffectively v continue to cultivate develop and maintain our distribution network of channel partners vi attract develop and retain individuals with the requisite innovation and technical expertise and understanding of customers’ needs to develop new technologies products and services vii continue to invest in manufacturing research and development engineering sales and marketing customer service and support and our distribution networks viii win large contracts and ix compete for business subject to applicable governmental procurement laws and policies including the buy america and buy american act requirements in the us as they may evolve over time 

we may not be successful in maintaining our competitive position which could adversely affect our business financial condition cash flows or results of operations the failure of our technologies products or services to maintain and gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings or customers’ slowerthanexpected adoption of and investment in our new and innovative technologies could significantly reduce our revenues or market share and adversely affect our competitive position pricing pressures also could cause us to adjust the prices of certain products to stay competitive or we may not be able to continue to win large contracts which could adversely affect our market share and competitive position 

cybersecurity incidents or other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure communications networks and operations could adversely affect our business products and services 

our business operations rely on information technology and communications networks some of which are operated by third parties including cloudbased service providers to process transmit and store our electronic information including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personal data relating to employees customers or other business partners we have or operate through a concentration of operations on certain sites such as production and shared service centers with the covid19 pandemic impacting our business since march 2020 a significant portion of our workforce transitioned to remote working which we expect to be the case for the foreseeable future and they are reliant on our information technology infrastructure and communication networks to perform their jobs as well as access to reliable and safe communication networks in their communities we also rely on third parties’ information technology systems to manage or support a variety of business processes and 

activities including with regard to remote work regardless of protection measures essentially all systems are susceptible to damage disruption or shutdown due to cybersecurity attacks including ransomware denialofservice computer viruses and security breaches equipment or system failure including due to maintenance obsolescence or age and other events or circumstances such as human error or malfeasance vandalism natural disaster fire power communication or other utility outage shutdown or utility failure and other events in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other business continuity and disaster recovery planning and response may be ineffective or inadequate 

in addition we offer certain services and products including pumps controllers and meters that may be digitallyenabled or connect to and are part of the “internet of things” iot and are used by third parties for operational purposes or to collect data cybersecurity attacks may target hardware software and information installed stored or transmitted by our products after they have been purchased and incorporated into third parties’ products facilities or infrastructure while we attempt to provide security measures to safeguard our products and services from cyber threats the potential for an attack remains a successful attack may result in the misappropriation destruction unauthorized access to or disclosure of third parties confidential information damage or disruption to third parties’ operations recall of our products or increased costs for security and remediation as well as damage to our brand reputation 

like many multinational companies we and some third parties upon which we rely have experienced cybersecurity attacks on information technology networks and systems products and services in the past and may experience them in the future likely with more frequency and involving a broader range of devices and modes of attack to date none have resulted in any material adverse impact to our business operations products services or customers we have adopted measures designed to mitigate potential risks associated with cybersecurity threats breaches or other disruptions or damage to our information technology networks and systems products and services but the unpredictability of the timing nature and scope of such disruptions and threats could impact our business operations products and services disruption to information technology and communications networks on which we rely or an attack on our products and services could interfere with our operations disrupt our supply chain and service to our customers interrupt production and shipments result in theft or compromise of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets damage employee customer and business partner relationships negatively impact our reputation result in legal claims and proceedings or regulatory enforcement actions and increase our costs for security and remediation any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

although we continue to assess these risks implement controls and perform business continuity and disaster recovery planning we cannot be sure that cybersecurity attacks or other interruptions with material adverse effects will not occur 

a material disruption to any of our facilities or operations or that of third parties upon which we rely may adversely affect our business 

our facilities and operations rely on a complex global supply chain including suppliers and their suppliers distributors contract manufacturers and logistics providers in addition our business relies on certain third parties to supply critical business processes and activities including in the areas of finance human resources procurement and information technology we also have or operate through a concentration of operations on certain sites such as production and shared services centers if our facilities or the operations of third parties upon which we rely were to be disrupted as a result of an actual or threatened event or circumstance including a significant equipment or system failure natural disaster effects of climate change power water or communications outage fire explosion critical supply failure terrorism cybersecurity attack political disruption outbreak of a pandemic or other public health crisis insurrection armed conflict or war labor dispute work stoppage or slowdown technology failure adverse weather conditions or other reason it could cause material adverse impacts to our financial performance operations and business including an inability to meet customer demand or contractual commitments increased costs reduced sales and impact our business processes and activities including our ability to timely report financial results any interruption in capability may be lengthy and have lasting effects require a significant amount of management and other employees time and focus and require us to make substantial expenditures to remedy the situation which could negatively affect our operations business processes and activities profitability and financial condition any recovery under our insurance policies may not offset the lost sales or increased costs that we may experience during a disruption or any resultant longerterm loss of suppliers sales or customers which could adversely affect our business financial condition cash flow and results of operations although we continue to assess these risks implement controls and perform business continuity and disaster recovery planning we cannot be sure that interruptions with material adverse effects on our operational and financial performance will not occur 

lack of availability of products parts and raw materials from our supply chain or the inability of suppliers to meet delivery requirements could adversely affect our business 

our business relies on suppliers and their suppliers including contract manufacturing commodity markets and logistics providers to secure and ship select finished goods and raw materials parts and components that are used in our products we expect that our reliance on and the complexity of the supply chain will continue to increase parts and raw materials commonly used in our products include motors fabricated parts castings bearings seals batteries pcbs and electronic components as well as commodities including steel brass nickel copper aluminum and plastics we are exposed to the availability of these parts components materials and finished goods which have in the past and may in the future be subject to delay curtailment or change due to among other things changes in the strategy or production planning of suppliers including decisions to exit production of key components upon which we rely interruptions in production by suppliers labor disputes the impaired financial condition of a particular supplier suppliers’ capacity allocations to other purchasers changes in trade agreements and trade protection measures including tariffs exchange rates and prevailing price levels ability to meet regulatory requirements weather emergencies and associated effects of climate change the effects of the covid19 pandemic or other public health crises or acts of war or terrorism in particular we have in the past and continue to experience capacity constraints and delays with respect to supply of electronic components any suspension or delay in our suppliers’ ability to provide us with necessary materials could impair our ability to timely deliver products to our customers and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

a significant portion of our products and offerings in our measurement  control solutions segment are affected by the availability regulation of and interference with radio spectrum that we use 

a significant portion of the offerings in our measurement  control solutions segment use radio spectrum which is subject to government regulation to the extent we introduce new products designed for use in the us or another country such products may require significant modification or redesign in order to meet frequency requirements and other regulatory specifications in some countries limitations on frequency availability or the cost of making necessary modifications may preclude us from selling our products in those countries the regulations that govern our use of radio spectrum may change which may require us to modify our products or seek new partnerships either directly or due to interference caused by new consumer products allowed under the regulations the inability to modify our products to meet such requirements the possible delays in completing or the cost of such modifications could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition we may not be able to secure suitable partners for codevelopment of products 

in the us our products are primarily designed to use fcclicensed spectrum in the 900mhz range if the fcc does not renew our existing spectrum licenses our business could be adversely affected in addition there may be insufficient available frequencies in some markets to sustain or develop our planned operations at a commercially feasible price or at all 

outside the us certain of our products require the use of radio frequency and are subject to regulations in some jurisdictions radio station licenses may be granted for a fixed term and must be periodically renewed our advanced and smart metering systems offerings transmit to and receive information from if applicable handheld mobile or fixed network reading devices in licensed bands made available to us through strategic partnerships and are reliant to some extent on the licensed spectrum continuing to be available through our partners or our customers we may be unable to find partners or customers that have access to sufficient frequencies in some markets to sustain or develop our planned operations or to find partners or customers that have access to sufficient frequencies in the relevant markets at a commercially feasible price or at all 

failure to retain our existing senior management engineering technology sales and other key personnel or the inability to attract and retain new qualified and diverse talent could negatively impact our business 

our success will continue to depend to a significant extent on our ability to retain and attract employees in senior management positions and in strategic or core competencies including engineering innovation digital technologies sales excellence and project management our success in attracting and retaining employees will depend on our ability to offer attractive compensation benefits training and development opportunities in an increasingly competitive environment for talent particularly in the fields of digital technologies innovation and data science in addition advancing our culture of diversity and inclusion is an important factor for executing on our strategy driving innovation remaining competitive and creating longterm value we also need to continue to develop qualified talent to support business growth and robust succession plans which are important to our longterm success a failure to attract or retain highly engaged and skilled personnel could adversely affect our ability to meet and exceed the needs of our customers operate or grow our business and execute our strategy 

we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring and realignment plans or our restructuring and realignment may adversely affect our business 

in 2020 in response to the business and economic conditions resulting from the covid19 pandemic as well as in recent fiscal years we have initiated restructuring and realignment plans in an effort to optimize our cost structure improve our operational efficiency and effectiveness strengthen our competitive positioning and better serve our customers we are also engaged in a multiyear effort to transform many of our support functions and related technologies including finance human resources and procurement challenges with the enabling technologies and delays in implementing planned restructuring and realignment activities have delayed the realization of some the expected operational and financial benefits from such actions as such we may not be able to obtain all of the cost savings and benefits that were initially anticipated in connection with our restructuring and realignment plans additionally as a result of these plans we may experience a loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge or inefficiencies during transitional periods and ongoing operations realignment and restructuring require a significant amount of management and other employees time and focus which may divert attention from operating and growing our business 

the successful implementation and execution of our restructuring and realignment actions are critical to achieving our expected cost savings as well as effectively competing in the marketplace and positioning us for future growth factors that may impede a successful implementation include the retention of key employees the impact of regulatory matters including tax matters involving certain thirdparty service providers selected to assist us including staffing technology service providers’ compliance with our internal controls over financial reporting and adverse economic market conditions if our restructuring and realignment actions are not executed successfully it could have material adverse impacts on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting our competitive position business financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

our strategy includes acquisitions and we may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisitions 

as part of our growth strategy we plan to continue to pursue the acquisition of other companies assets technologies product lines and customer channels that either complement or expand our existing business or improve our competitive position we may not be able to complete transactions with favorable terms or timing or obtain financing that may be needed to consummate acquisitions or complete proposed acquisitions in addition our results of operations may be adversely impacted by i the failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses into our operations technology and financial and other systems ii the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns which has led to and in the future may lead to accounting impairments iii the discovery of unanticipated liabilities labor relations difficulties cybersecurity concerns control or compliance issues or other issues for which we lack contractual protections insurance or indemnities 

acquisitions involve a number of risks and present financial managerial and operational challenges including diversion of management’s attention from existing businesses and operations insufficient internal controls over financial or compliance activities or financial reporting the failure to realize expected synergies the assumption of new material risks associated with the acquired businesses and the loss of key employees of the acquired businesses failure to successfully execute our growth strategy via acquisitions and successfully integrate these acquisitions could adversely affect our competitive position business financial condition or results of operations 

product defects unanticipated use or inadequate disclosures with respect to our products could adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements 

defects inadequacies or quality issues in the manufacture design software security or service of our products including in products parts or components that we source from third parties unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of our products could result in product safety product security regulatory or environmental risks including personal injury death property or environmental damage these events could also lead to recalls safety or security alerts relating to our products result in the removal of a product from the market andor result in warranty or liability claims against us although we have liability insurance we cannot be certain that this insurance coverage will continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost or will be adequate to cover any or all aspects of liability claims manufacturing design software security or service defects or inadequacies may also result in contractual damages against us warranty expenses or issuance of credits which could impact our profitability recalls removals and warranty liability and quality claims can result in significant costs as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our financial results can be difficult to predict 

our business is impacted by a substantial amount of short cycle and bookandbill business which we have limited insight into particularly for the business that we transact through our significant distribution network we are also impacted by our long cycle business including large projects which could be unexpectedly cancelled or whose timing can change based upon customer requirements due to a number of factors affecting the project that are beyond our knowledge or control such as funding readiness of the project and regulatory approvals accordingly our financial results for any given period can be difficult to predict 

weather conditions including the effects of climate change may cause volatility in several served markets and may affect our financial results 

the unpredictable nature of weather conditions including heavy flooding prolonged droughts and fluctuations in temperatures or weather patterns including as a result of climate change can positively or negatively impact portions of our business as well as the operations of certain of our customers and suppliers for example heavy flooding and rain events which may be due to global climate change may increase demand for some of our solutions that may help customers manage water and storm water overflows within the dewatering space pumps provided through our godwin and flygt brands are used to remove and transfer excess or unwanted water on the other hand prolonged drought conditions drive higher demand for pumps used in agriculture and turf irrigation applications such as those provided by our goulds water technology and lowara brands in addition fluctuations in temperatures result in varying levels of demand for products used in residential and commercial hydronic applications where homes and buildings use circulating water to heat and cool living spaces such as those provided by our bell  gossett brand significant fluctuations in these weather conditions and climate changes can therefore result in volatility in our financial results 

our debt obligations may adversely affect our business and our ability to meet our obligations and pay dividends 

as of december 31 2020 our total outstanding indebtedness was 3084 million as described under “liquidity and capital resources and we may incur additional debt in the future our indebtedness could have adverse consequences to us and our investors including 

• increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

• limiting our ability to obtain additional financing or borrow additional funds 

• reducing or eliminating our ability to pay future dividends or repurchase our common stock 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and industry 

• requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make principal and interest payments 

• reducing the cash flows available to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or other general corporate purposes to grow business 

• increasing the amount of interest expense that we must pay because some of our borrowings are at variable interest rates which as interest rates increase would result in higher interest expense and 

• increasing the risk of a future credit ratings downgrade which could increase future debt costs and limit the availability of debt financing 

in addition there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available to us on favorable terms or at all for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness the terms of the debt may also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on our operations than we currently have 

our ability to make scheduled principal payments of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend on our future cash flows from operations which may not be sufficient and may be affected by factors beyond our control if we are unable to service our indebtedness our business financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 

we may incur additional impairment charges for our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets which would negatively impact our operating results 

we have a significant amount of goodwill and purchased intangible assets on our balance sheet as a result of acquisitions as of december 31 2020 the net carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets totaled approximately 3 billion in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we evaluate these assets for impairment at least annually or more frequently if changes in events or circumstances indicate it is 

more likely than not that a potential impairment could exist significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business or our customers’ business inability to effectively integrate or scale acquired businesses increases in cost of capital unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets failure of the fcc to renew radio spectrum licenses divestitures and market capitalization declines may cause impairment of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for example in 2020 and 2019 we recorded goodwill impairment charges of 58 million and 148 million respectively within our measurement  control solutions segment primarily related to the performance of the business of the pure technologies ltd acquisition pure as detailed in note 12 “goodwill and other intangible assets” material impairment charges have in the past and could in the future adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

risks related to legal regulatory and tax 

failure to comply with laws regulations and policies including the us foreign corrupt practices act other applicable anticorruption laws trade regulations and data privacy and security laws could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition and reputation 

given our global operations we are subject to regulation under a wide variety of us federal and state and nonus laws regulations and policies including laws and regulations related to anticorruption trade including export and import compliance antitrust and money laundering our policies mandate compliance with these laws and regulations the us foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa the uk bribery act of 2010 and similar anticorruption laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business we operate in many parts of the world that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption and in certain circumstances strict compliance with anticorruption laws may conflict with local business customs and practices we cannot guarantee that our internal controls policies and procedures will always protect us from improper conduct of our employees or business partners in the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees or business partners have or may have violated applicable laws regulations or policies including anticorruption laws we are required to investigate the relevant facts and circumstances which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management any such violation could result in substantial fines sanctions civil andor criminal penalties termination of relationships with business partners and curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions and as a result might materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition in addition actual or alleged violations could damage our reputation and ability to do business 

additionally to conduct our operations we regularly move data across borders and consequently we are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations regarding data privacy data protection and data security including the california consumer protection act and the eus gdpr the scope of the laws that may be applicable to us is evolving often uncertain and may be conflicting particularly with respect to foreign laws gdpr greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of eu law and adds a broad array of requirements for handling personal data including the enforcement of data subject rights enhanced security requirements obligations to guarantee eu data subject rights are not compromised in countries outside the eu and public disclosure of significant data breaches other countries such as china have enacted or are enacting data localization and security laws that require data to stay within their borders all of these evolving legal and operational requirements impose significant costs of compliance that are likely to increase over time any such violation could result in substantial fines sanctions andor civil penalties damage to our reputation and might materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

changes in our effective tax rates and tax expenses may adversely affect our financial results 

we sell our products in approximately 150 countries and 53 of our revenue was generated outside the us in 2020 given the global nature of our business a number of factors may increase our effective tax rates and tax expense including 

• the geographic mix of jurisdictions in which profits are earned and taxed 

• the statutory tax rates and tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business 

• the resolution of tax issues arising from tax examinations by various tax authorities and 

• the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities 

additionally tax laws regulations and administrative practices in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change with or without notice due to economic political and other conditions and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes the recent change in the us presidential administration increases the uncertainty with regard to potential changes in the us federal tax laws and the interpretation or enforcement of legislation or directives by tax authorities 

we are regularly examined by various tax authorities throughout the world and the resolutions of these examinations do not typically have a significant impact on our effective tax rates and tax expenses but they could for example following an examination regarding aspects of the reorganization of our european business that occurred in 2013 the swedish tax authority issued a tax assessment to xylem’s swedish subsidiary in 2019 which we are appealing as further described in note 7 “income taxes” this examination as well as other examinations can result in increased tax assessments and settlement or litigation about the assessments and final resolution could be adverse to xylem we regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes including unrecognized tax benefits however developments in an audit or litigation could materially and adversely affect us although we believe our tax estimates and accruals are reasonable there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in its historical income tax provisions accruals and unrecognized tax benefits which could materially and adversely affect our business operating results cash flows and financial condition 

we face risks related to legal and regulatory proceedings 

we are subject to various laws ordinances regulations and other requirements of government authorities in the us and foreign countries any violation of which could potentially create substantial liability for us and damage our reputation changes in laws ordinances regulations or other government policies the nature timing and effect of which are uncertain may significantly increase our expenses and liabilities 

from time to time we are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings that are incidental to the operation of our businesses or the business operations of previouslyowned entities these proceedings may seek remedies relating to environmental matters tax intellectual property acquisitions or divestitures product liability property damage personal injury privacy employment labor and pensions government contract issues and commercial or contractual disputes our continued transition to connected and digital technologies and solutions has increased our exposure to intellectual property litigation and we expect that this risk will continue to increase as we execute on our innovation and technology priorities 

it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of claims investigations regulatory proceedings and lawsuits and we could in the future incur judgments fines or penalties or enter into settlements and claims that could have an adverse effect on our reputation our business results of operations and financial condition additionally we may be required to change or cease operations at one or more facilities if a regulatory agency determines that we have failed to comply with laws regulations or orders applicable to our business 

the global and diverse nature of our operations coupled with the increase in regulation and enforcement in many regions of the globe means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal and regulatory proceedings and other contingencies the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty will arise from time to time in addition subsequent developments in legal and regulatory proceedings may affect our assessments and estimates of loss contingencies recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments in excess of our reserves which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

infringement or expiration of our intellectual property rights or allegations that we have infringed upon the intellectual property rights of third parties could negatively affect us 

we own numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others that are important to our business our intellectual property rights may provide us with competitive advantage because they may help us differentiate our technologies products and services including our growing portfolio of data analytics and digitallyenabled offerings however our current or future intellectual property rights may not be sufficiently broad or may be challenged invalidated circumvented misappropriated independently developed or designedaround particularly given our international operations in countries where laws governing intellectual property rights are not highly developed protected or enforced our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention misappropriation or unauthorized use of such property as well as the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we receive notices from third parties alleging intellectual property infringement or misappropriation any dispute or litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming to defend due to the complexity and uncertainty of intellectual property litigation our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation in addition as a result of such claims of infringement or misappropriation we could lose our rights to use critical technology be unable to license critical technology or sell critical products and services be required 

to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the use of thirdparty intellectual property rights or be required to redesign our products at substantial cost any of which could adversely impact our competitive position financial condition and results of operations even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation we may incur significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

developments in and compliance with current and future environmental and climate change laws and regulations could impact our business financial condition or results of operations 

our business operations and product and service offerings are subject to and affected by many federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations including those enacted in response to climate change concerns 

climate change is receiving ever increasing attention globally as many governments scientists and organizations such as the united nations warn of the effects on our climate of increasing levels of greenhouse gases increased public and governmental awareness and concern regarding global climate change has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions and will likely result in increasing environmental and climate change laws or regulations compliance with these current and future laws and regulations currently requires and is expected to continue to require increasing operating and capital expenditures which could impact our business financial condition and results of operations additionally president bidens administration may increase the likelihood of potential changes in these laws and regulations and the enforcement of any existing or new legislation or directives by government authorities 

environmental laws and regulations may authorize substantial fines and criminal sanctions as well as facility shutdowns to address violations and may require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit emissions or discharges we also incur and expect to continue to incur costs to comply with current environmental laws and regulations developments such as the adoption of new environmental laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations violations by us of such laws and regulations discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination litigation involving environmental impacts our inability to recover costs associated with any such developments or financial insolvency of other responsible parties could in the future have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

our spinoff from itt may expose us to potential liabilities 

pursuant to the distribution agreement and certain other agreements with itt now itt llc and exelis acquired by harris corporation now l3harris technologies inc itt and exelis agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities and we agreed to indemnify itt and exelis for certain liabilities indemnities that we may be required to provide itt and exelis may be significant and could negatively impact our business third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that itt or exelis agreed to retain further there can be no assurance that the indemnities from itt and exelis will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities or that itt and exelis will be able to fully satisfy their indemnification obligations moreover even if we ultimately were to succeed in recovering from itt and exelis any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves each of these risks could negatively affect our business results of operations cash flow and financial condition

covid19 pandemic 

the global spread of covid19 has curtailed the movement of people goods and services worldwide including in many of the regions where we sell our products and services and conduct operations 

this section summarizes the most significant impacts related to the covid19 pandemic that we have experienced to date and we have included additional details as applicable throughout other sections of this annual report many of these impacts did not begin to be felt broadly across our businesses until the latter part of the first quarter of 2020 and have continued through the remainder of the year as the covid19 pandemic began to unfold in the first quarter of 2020 xylem deployed a covid19 response team responsible for xylems pandemic plan which is designed to aid in prevention preparedness response and recovery at our sites and across the company 

depending on the severity magnitude and duration of the covid19 pandemic and its economic consequences we anticipate that it will become more difficult to distinguish specific aspects of our operational and financial performance that are most directly related to covid19 from those that are more broadly influenced by ongoing macroeconomic market and industry dynamics that are to varying degrees related to the covid19 pandemic and its consequences 

public health officials have recommended or governments have mandated precautions to mitigate the spread of covid19 including stay at home or similar measures such as travel restrictions for periods of time in many of the areas in which we operate operationally a number of our production facilities across the globe experienced reduced production levels due to such measures to varying degrees during the year however our current overall operating capacity approximates normal levels globally in order to maintain a safe work environment our production facilities continue to spread operations over multiple shifts and implement other protective measures such as testing temperature screening and social distancing while maintaining operational capabilities 

the covid19 pandemic is also adversely affecting and is expected to continue to adversely affect our operations supply chains and businesses we expect to continue experiencing unpredictable interruptions with our external suppliers into 2021 that could lead to increased logistic costs we have enhanced our supplier pulsing and redundancy to help mitigate these challenges and do not expect these interruptions to result in a material impact to our business additionally we have in the past and may continue to take measures with respect to buffer stock to minimize freight and logistics delays if these interruptions are sustained or additional interruptions occur they could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

to date the most significant operational impacts we have experienced are volume reductions ranging across all segments and major geographic regions although regions such as europe and china have started to recover and experienced organic revenue growth during the fourth quarter of 2020 recovery in regions such as the us the middle east and india continues to lag 

future demand for our products and services is uncertain as the covid19 pandemic has also had an adverse impact on many of the customers we serve as such we have and may continue to experience decreased or delayed demand for our products and services at the end of 2020 total backlog increased 179 as compared to december 31 2019 in many cases xylem’s products and services are considered essential services under various governmental mandates and as a result we did not experience significant issues in our ability to distribute products or services aside from customerdriven project delays inability to access or travel to customer sites and shipping delays due to stay at home measures however because the severity magnitude and duration of the covid19 pandemic and its economic consequences are uncertain the pandemic’s ongoing and future impacts on our business financial condition results of operations and stock price remain uncertain and difficult to predict and we expect that our results may continue to be adversely impacted beyond the year ending december 31 2020 

in response to the changes in business and economic conditions arising as a result of the covid19 pandemic management committed to restructuring activities across our businesses and functions globally during the second quarter of 2020 these initiatives are designed to support our longterm financial resilience and simplify our operations strengthen our competitive positioning and better serve our customers in light of the uncertainty created by the covid19 pandemic we also proactively took further cost reduction actions in 2020 which included a temporary 20 reduction in the base salary of the companys chief executive officer ceo and all ceo direct reports and a temporary 20 reduction in annual cash retainer fees payable to our board of directors effective from june 1 2020 through december 31 2020 additionally in 2020 we committed to reduced capital expenditure and discretionary operating spending we anticipate that our capital expenditure spending will ramp up to more normal levels throughout 2021 as we see improvements in our markets 

since the pandemic started xylem has taken measures to protect the health and safety of our employees work with our customers to minimize potential disruptions and positively impact our communities in the first quarter of 

2020 we implemented a support pay program for employees impacted by covid19 and an essential services premium pay program for the benefit of employees whose roles are classified as an “essential service” and as such are required to work either onsite at a xylem facility or in the field supporting customers during periods of mandated stay at home or similar measures these programs will remain in place through the first quarter of 2021 and continue to be evaluated for continuation as necessary going forward xylem watermark our corporate social responsibility program is also supporting our communities in addressing the challenges posed by this global pandemic through its partnership with americares and unicef as well as the expansion of the partner community grants program and matching donations program for employees and partners and other philanthropic commitments during 2020 xylem also repurposed internal manufacturing capabilities and working with our partners leveraged our supply chain to donate 300000 pieces of personal protective equipment ppe to frontline workers 

many of our offices globally have transitioned to a substantially remote work from home status with no material disruption to operations financial reporting systems internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures as public health officials and governments ease recommendations and regulations regarding stay at home measures our covid19 response team applies a set of xylem return to workplace health and safety guidelines for remote workers to return to our facilities these guidelines require government officials to first declare an easing of their restrictions upon which we do a full review of our site to determine its readiness and follow a phased return to work approach all in service to help ensure the safety of our people 

we will continue to work with our customers employees suppliers and communities to address the impacts of covid19 we also continue to assess the evolving nature of the pandemic and its possible implications to our business supply chain and customers and to take actions in an effort to mitigate adverse consequences 

risks related to the impact of covid19 are described in further detail under item 1a risk factors

executive summary 

xylem reported revenue of 4876 million for 2020 a decrease of 373 million or 71 from 5249 million reported in 2019 on a constant currency basis revenue decreased by 366 million or 70 driven by an organic decline across all end markets and across all segments during the year organic revenue decline during the year was anticipated as our business was negatively impacted by the covid19 pandemic 

operating income for 2020 was 367 million reflecting a decrease of 119 million or 245 compared to 486 million in 2019 operating margin was 75 for 2020 versus 93 for 2019 a decrease of 180 basis points operating margin benefited from decreases in special charges of 78 million and decreases in restructuring and realignment costs of 5 million during the year excluding the impact of these items adjusted operating income was 525 million with an adjusted operating margin of 108 in 2020 as compared to adjusted operating income of 727 million with an adjusted operating margin of 139 in 2019 a decrease of 310 basis points the decrease in adjusted operating margin was primarily due to unfavorable volume impacted significantly by covid19 cost inflation increased quality management costs unfavorable mix and increased spending on strategic investments these impacts were partially offset by cost reductions from our productivity restructuring and other cost saving initiatives 

additional financial highlights for 2020 include the following 

• net income of 254 million or 140 per diluted share 374 million or 206 per diluted share on an adjusted basis down 316 from 2019 

• net cash provided by operating activities of 824 million and free cash flow of 641 million up 5 from 2019 

• orders of 5033 million down 57 from 5339 million in 2019 down 53 on an organic basis impacted by the covid19 pandemic and 

• dividends paid to shareholders increased 8 in 2020 

2021 business outlook 

we anticipate total revenue growth in the range of 6 to 8 in 2021 with organic revenue growth anticipated to be in the range of 3 to 5 the following is a summary of our 2020 organic revenue performance and 2021 organic revenue outlook by end market 

• utilities revenue decreased by approximately 6 for 2020 on an organic basis driven by weakness in the us the middle east and asia pacific partially offset by strength in europe for 2021 we expect organic growth in the lowtomid singledigit range with continued resilience on the wastewater side as utilities remain focused on missioncritical applications and anticipate modest recovery on a global basis through the year additionally we expect that large clean water utility project deployments will be ramping up beginning in the second quarter and increasing throughout the end of the year we expect to gain momentum behind key multiyear wins setting up healthy longer term growth however we believe the end market will continue to be impacted by the covid19 pandemic through the year 

• industrial revenue decreased by approximately 10 for 2020 on an organic basis driven by weakness across all major geographic regions for 2021 we expect organic revenue to be relatively flat to up lowsingledigits as shortcycle orders and project activity continues to pick up during the year however activity is still likely to be limited in the nearterm by covid19 impacts we expect that continued softness in the segments served by our dewatering business in north america will stabilize and begin to accelerate through the year 

• in the commercial markets organic revenue decline was approximately 6 for 2020 driven by weakness in the us and the emerging markets partially offset by strength in western europe for 2021 we expect organic revenue to be relatively flat to down lowsingledigits we expect replacement business in the us to be modestly soft during the year as the covid19 pandemic continues to impact market conditions while we anticipate healthy activity in europe as the region continues to recover we expect new construction activity in north america to be slow throughout the first half of the year 

• in residential markets organic revenue decline was approximately 2 in 2020 driven by weakness in the us and western europe partially offset by strength in asia pacific this market is primarily driven by replacement revenue serviced through our distribution network for 2021 we expect organic revenue to be up lowtomid single digits driven by healthy demand activity from increased residential users in the us 

and europe additionally we anticipate strong demand in china for secondary water supply product applications 

we will continue to strategically execute restructuring and realignment actions in an effort to optimize our cost structure improve our operational efficiency and effectiveness strengthen our competitive positioning and better serve our customers during 2020 we incurred 54 million and 23 million in restructuring and realignment costs respectively we realized approximately 25 million of incremental net savings in 2020 from actions initiated in 2019 and an additional 22 million of net savings from our 2020 actions as a result of our 2019 and 2020 actions we expect to realize approximately 46 million of incremental net savings in 2021 and beyond during 2021 we currently expect to incur between 50 million and 60 million in restructuring and realignment costs 

we plan to continue to take actions and focus spending in 2021 on actions that allow us to make progress on our top strategic priorities these priorities include 1 driving customer success by focusing on enhancing the customer experience accelerating the digital transformation of water and building a leadership position in services and solutions 2 growing in the emerging markets by investing in localizing our capabilities in these regions 3 strengthening innovation and technology by creating new customer offerings that help solve water challenges in a more powerful way 4 enhancing operational excellence by building a culture of continuous improvement and 5 cultivating leadership talent and development that drives shareholder value creation

revenue generated for 2020 was 4876 million a decrease of 373 million or 71 compared to 5249 million in 2019 on a constant currency basis revenue declined 70 during 2020 the decrease at constant currency was driven by a decline in organic revenue of 364 million reflecting significantly lower volumes in the us primarily as well as the middle east india and latin america largely due to covid19 partially offset by growth in europe and china during the year 

the following table illustrates the impact from organic declines recent acquisitions and divestitures and foreign currency translation in relation to revenue during 2020 



a foreign currency translation impact for the year primarily due to the weakening in value of various currencies against the us dollar the largest being the russian ruble the norwegian krone the brazilian real the south african rand and the chilean peso these impacts were partially offset by the strengthening of the euro during the year 

water infrastructure 

water infrastructure revenue decreased 98 million or 45 to 2079 million in 2020 41 decrease on a constant currency basis compared to 2019 revenue was negatively impacted by 9 million of foreign currency translation with the change at constant currency coming entirely from an organic decline during the year of 89 million organic weakness during the year was primarily driven by the industrial end market particularly in north america and the emerging markets heavily impacted by the covid19 pandemic during the year organic revenue decline during the year was also impacted by weakness to a lesser extent in the utility end market particularly in the us partially offset by organic growth in europe during the year the covid19 pandemic negatively impacted organic growth during the year throughout the entire segment and both end markets 

from an application perspective the organic revenue decline for the year was driven by our transport application where market conditions continued to soften in the us in the dewatering applications with construction mining oil and gas all down during the year we also saw organic revenue decline in asia pacific within the transport application primarily in india where we lapped some large projects executed in the prior year as well as in latin america these declines were partially offset by organic growth in europe during the year where demand for essential service work increased during the fourth quarter organic revenue declines within the transport application were partially offset by modest organic growth in the treatment application during the year primarily driven by projects in the emerging markets 

applied water 

applied water revenue decreased 107 million or 69 in 2020 70 decrease on a constant currency basis compared to 2019 revenue benefited from 1 million of foreign currency translation with the change at constant currency coming entirely from an organic decline during the year of 108 million organic weakness during the year was driven by declines across all end markets and applications with industrial water and commercial building services declining the most followed by a modest decline in building services in the residential market as well organic revenue declines in the segment were driven by the covid19 pandemic where restricted activities caused a slow down and general softening in markets served particularly in the us the emerging markets and western europe 

measurement  control solutions 

measurement  control solutions revenue decreased 168 million or 110 in 2020 110 decrease on a constant currency basis compared to 2019 revenue benefited from 1 million of foreign currency translation during the year with the change at constant currency driven by an organic decline of 167 million or 109 and to a lesser extent 2 million of reduced revenue related to divestiture impacts during the year organic weakness during the year was driven by declines in the utility end market primarily in the us the middle east and india marginally offset by organic growth in western europe during the year organic declines were also driven to a lesser extent by weakness in the industrial end market primarily in western europe north america and the middle east organic revenue declines in the segment were significantly impacted by project timing and the covid19 pandemic during the year 

from an application perspective the organic revenue decline was primarily driven by the water application where we lapped large prior year project deployments in the us and middle east and the covid19 pandemic drove project delays primarily due to siteaccess restrictions and overall market softness in the us the energy application also had a decline in organic revenue as compared to the prior year primarily in the us as we lapped a few large gas project deployments and have been negatively impacted by the covid19 pandemic the test application also experienced organic revenue decline during the year driven by negative impacts from the covid19 pandemic across most major geographic regions and the lapping of a couple large prior year project executions in the middle east the software as a service saas application had a modest decline in revenue as compared to the prior year primarily in the us 

ordersbacklog 

an order represents a legally enforceable written document that includes the scope of work or services to be performed or equipment to be supplied to a customer the corresponding price and the expected delivery date for the applicable products or services to be provided an order often takes the form of a customer purchase order or a signed quote from a xylem business orders received during 2020 decreased by 306 million or 57 to 5033 million 54 decrease on a constant currency basis order intake during the year was negatively impacted by 18 million of foreign currency translation the order decline on a constant currency basis primarily consisted of organic order declines of 284 million or 53 over the prior year 

the following table illustrates the impact from organic declines recent acquisitions and divestitures and foreign currency translation in relation to orders during 2020 



a foreign currency translation impact for the year primarily due to the weakening in value of various currencies against the us dollar the largest being the russian ruble the norwegian krone the brazilian real the south african rand and the chilean peso these impacts were partially offset by the strengthening of the euro during the year 

water infrastructure 

water infrastructure segment orders decreased 100 million or 45 to 2134 million 36 decrease on a constant currency basis order intake during the year was negatively impacted by 20 million of foreign currency translation with the change at constant currency coming from organic order decline in the transport application which was partially offset by growth in the treatment application during the year the transport application experienced an organic order decline during the year primarily driven by market weakness in construction mining and oil and gas impacting the dewatering application in north america along with the lapping of a large project order in india in the prior year organic growth in the treatment application was primarily driven by strong order intake in north america the covid19 pandemic also negatively impacted organic order growth for the segment during the year 

applied water 

applied water segment orders decreased 73 million to 1483 million or 47 as compared to the prior year and was not significantly impacted by foreign currency translation during the year the order decrease was primarily driven by organic weakness across all end markets primarily in the us and to a lesser extent in the emerging markets and western europe the organic order growth for the segment during the year was negatively impacted by the covid19 pandemic 

measurement  control solutions 

measurement  control solutions segment orders decreased 133 million or 86 to 1416 million 87 decrease on a constant currency basis order intake during the year benefited from 2 million of foreign currency translation with the change at constant currency driven by an organic decline of 131 million and to a lesser extent a 4 million reduction in orders related to divestiture impacts during the year organic weakness during the year was driven by the water application where we lapped prior year project orders and to a lesser extent the energy application where prior year gas project deployments more than offset strong electric order intake during the year the saas application also contributed to the organic decline during the year driven by the lapping of large project orders in north america during the prior year the test application also experienced a reduction in order intake during the year primarily in the uk and the us the covid19 pandemic significantly impacted the organic order growth during the year 

backlog 

backlog includes orders on hand as well as contractual customer agreements at the end of the period delivery schedules vary from customer to customer based on their requirements annual or multiyear contracts are subject to rescheduling and cancellation by customers due to the longterm nature of the contracts as such beginning total backlog plus orders minus revenues will not equal ending total backlog due to contract adjustments foreign currency fluctuations and other factors typically large projects require longer lead production cycles and deployment schedules and delays can occur from time to time total backlog was 2124 million at december 31 2020 and 1801 million at december 31 2019 an increase of 179 we anticipate that approximately 55 of our total backlog at december 31 2020 will be recognized as revenue during 2021 

gross margin 

gross margin as a percentage of consolidated revenue decreased 150 basis points to 375 in 2020 as compared to 390 in 2019 the gross margin decrease for the year was primarily driven by cost inflation increased quality management costs unfavorable mix unfavorable volume impacted by covid19 and other lesser impacts which were partially offset by cost reductions from our global procurement and productivity improvement initiatives and price realization 

operating expenses 



selling general and administrative sga expenses 

sga expenses decreased by 15 million decrease of 13 to 234 of revenue in 2020 as compared to 221 of revenue in 2019 the increase in sga as a percent of revenue for the year was primarily driven by the drop in revenue which was significantly driven by impacts of the covid19 pandemic as well as cost inflation and additional investment in strategic growth initiatives cost reductions from our productivity restructuring and other cost saving initiatives partially offset these items 

research and development rd expenses 

rd expense was 187 million or 38 of revenue in 2020 as compared to 191 million or 36 of revenue in 2019 the increase in rd as a percent of revenue for year was primarily driven by the companys continued focus on strategic investments during the year while revenue was negatively impacted by the covid19 pandemic 

restructuring and asset impairment charges 

restructuring 

in response to the changes in business and economic conditions arising as a result of the covid19 pandemic on june 2 2020 management committed to a restructuring plan that includes actions across our businesses and functions globally the plan is designed to support our longterm financial resilience and simplify our operations strengthen our competitive positioning and better serve our customers 

as a result of this action during 2020 we recognized restructuring charges of 20 million 4 million and 30 million in our water infrastructure applied water and measurement  control solutions segments respectively these charges included reduction of headcount across all segments and asset impairments within our measurement  control solutions segment immaterial restructuring charges incurred during the first quarter are included in the plan information presented below 

during 2019 we recognized restructuring costs of 20 million 5 million and 28 million in our water infrastructure applied water and measurement  control solutions respectively these charges were incurred primarily as a continuation of our efforts to reposition our european and north american businesses to optimize our cost structure 

and improve our operational efficiency and effectiveness the charges included the reduction of headcount and consolidation of facilities within our measurement  control solutions and water infrastructure segments as well as headcount reductions within our applied water segment 

the following is a rollforward of employee position eliminations associated with restructuring activities for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 



the following table presents expected restructuring spend in 2020 and thereafter 



the water infrastructure applied water and measurement  control solutions actions commenced in 2020 consist primarily of severance charges in each of the segments and asset impairment charges in our measurement  control solutions segment these actions are expected to continue through 2021 the water infrastructure applied water and measurement  control solutions actions commenced in 2019 consist primarily of severance charges the actions commenced in 2019 are complete 

during the second quarter of 2020 the discontinuance of a product line resulted in 17 million of asset impairments primarily related to customer relationships trademarks and fixed assets within our measurement  control solutions segment 

these restructuring charges are primarily related to actions taken in response to the changes in business and economic conditions arising as a result of the covid19 pandemic as a result of the actions initiated in 2020 we achieved savings of approximately 22 million in 2020 and estimate annual future net savings beginning in 2021 of approximately 63 million resulting in 41 million of incremental savings from 2020 actions 

asset impairment 

during the second and third quarters of 2020 we determined that certain assets within our measurement  control solutions segment including software proprietary technology and internally developed inprocess software were impaired accordingly we recognized impairment charges of 21 million during the year refer to note 12 goodwill and other intangible assets for additional information 

during the first and third quarters of 2019 we determined that certain assets within our measurement  control solutions segment including customer relationships internally developed software proprietary technology and plant property  equipment were impaired accordingly we recognized impairment charges of 10 million during the year refer to note 12 goodwill and other intangible assets for additional information 

goodwill impairment charge 

during the third quarter of 2020 the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 58 million related to the aia goodwill reporting unit within our measurement  control solutions segment the aia goodwill reporting unit is 

comprised of our assessment services business primarily the pure acquisition as well as our digital solutions business the impairment resulted from managements updated forecast of future cash flows for the aia businesses which reflects significant negative volume impacts primarily on our assessment services business due to travel restrictions and site closures as a result of the covid19 pandemic our ongoing investment in the aia businesses also continues to impact nearterm profitability these factors drove a decrease in the fair value based on a discounted cash flow valuation of the aia goodwill reporting unit that is below its carrying value as of the third quarter requiring an impairment charge refer to note 12 goodwill and other intangible assets for additional information 

during the third quarter of 2019 the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 148 million related to the aia goodwill reporting unit the impairment resulted from a downward revision of forecasted future cash flows factors that contributed to the revised forecast in the third quarter of 2019 included lowerthanexpected results as compared to prior forecasts largely as a result of slowerthanexpected conversion of pipeline opportunities to revenue additionally we have continued to invest in the aia platform ahead of the adoption curve which has also impacted the nearterm profitability of the business these factors drove a decrease in the fair value based on a discounted cash flow valuation of the aia goodwill reporting unit that was below its carrying value as of july 1 2019 requiring an impairment charge refer to note 12 goodwill and other intangible assets for additional information 

operating income 

operating income was 367 million operating margin of 75 during 2020 a decrease of 119 million or 245 when compared to operating income of 486 million operating margin of 93 during the prior year operating margin benefited from decreases in special charges of 78 million and decreases in restructuring and realignment costs of 5 million as compared to the prior year excluding these special charges and restructuring and realignment costs adjusted operating income was 525 million adjusted operating margin of 108 for 2020 as compared to adjusted operating income of 727 million adjusted operating margin of 139 during the prior year the decrease in adjusted operating margin was primarily due to unfavorable volume impacted significantly by covid19 cost inflation increased quality management costs unfavorable mix and increased spending on strategic investments these impacts were partially offset by cost reductions from our productivity restructuring and other cost saving initiatives 

the table below provides a reconciliation of total and each segments operating income to adjusted operating income and a calculation of the corresponding adjusted operating margin 



nm not meaningful 

water infrastructure 

operating income for our water infrastructure segment decreased 47 million or 129 during 2020 as compared to the prior year with operating margin also decreasing from 168 to 153 operating margin benefited from a decrease in restructuring and realignment costs of 3 million in 2020 excluding these restructuring and realignment costs adjusted operating income decreased 50 million or 126 with adjusted operating margin decreasing from 182 to 166 the decrease in adjusted operating margin during the year was primarily due to cost inflation unfavorable volume impacted significantly by covid19 unfavorable mix increased inventory management costs increased spending on strategic investments and increased customer related reserves these impacts were partially offset by cost reductions from our productivity and other cost saving initiatives and price realization 

applied water 

operating income for our applied water segment decreased 36 million or 149 during 2020 as compared to the prior year with operating margin also decreasing from 156 to 143 operating margin benefited from a decrease in restructuring and realignment costs of 4 million in 2020 excluding these restructuring and realignment costs adjusted operating income decreased 40 million or 157 with adjusted operating margin decreasing from 165 to 149 the decrease in adjusted operating margin during the year was primarily due to cost inflation unfavorable volume impacted significantly by covid19 increased inventory management costs and other lesser impacts these impacts were partially offset by cost reductions from our productivity and other cost saving initiatives and price realization 

measurement  control solutions 

operating loss for our measurement  control solutions segment increased 39 million or 582 during 2020 as compared to the prior year resulting in an operating loss of 106 million with operating margin decreasing from 44 to 78 operating margin benefited from a decrease in special charges of 80 million which was slightly offset by increased restructuring and realignment costs of 2 million in 2020 excluding these items adjusted operating income decreased 117 million or 900 with adjusted operating margin decreasing from 85 to 10 the decrease in adjusted operating margin during the year was driven by unfavorable volume impacted significantly by covid19 related siteaccess restrictions and customer project delays cost inflation unfavorable mix increased quality management costs primarily due to warranty charges recorded during the the year increased spending on strategic investments and other lesser impacts these impacts were partially offset by cost reductions from our productivity and other cost saving initiatives and price realization 

corporate and other 

operating loss for corporate and other decreased 3 million or 57 compared to the prior year the decrease in costs are the result of cost saving actions taken during the year 

interest expense 

interest expense was 77 million and 67 million for 2020 and 2019 respectively the increase in interest expense for both periods is primarily driven by the issuance of our green bond as defined in funding and liquidity strategy during the second quarter of 2020 see note 15 credit facilities and debt of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our credit facilities and longterm debt and related interest 

income tax expense 

the income tax provision for 2020 was 31 million at an effective tax rate of 109 as compared to 15 million at an effective tax rate of 37 in 2019 the 2020 effective tax rate differs from that of 2019 primarily due to the impact of the changes in tax law in switzerland in 2019 along with the impact of the larger goodwill impairment charge on income before taxes in 2019 as well as a reduction in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits recorded in 2020 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash 



a 2020 impact is primarily due to the strengthening of the euro the chinese yuan and various other currencies against the us dollar 

sources and uses of liquidity 

operating activities 

during 2020 net cash provided by operating activities was 824 million compared to 839 million in 2019 the 15 million yearoveryear decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in cash from earnings partially offset by deferred payments lower income tax payments and improved working capital management 

investing activities 

cash used in investing activities was 169 million in 2020 compared to 231 million in 2019 this decrease in cash used of 62 million was mainly driven by lower spending on capital expenditures compared to the prior year and a reduction in cash paid for acquisitions 

financing activities 

cash generated by financing activities was 473 million in 2020 compared to cash used of 177 million in 2019 the net increase in cash generated by financing activities during the year was primarily driven by the issuance of our green bond as defined in funding and liquidity strategy and higher levels of shortterm debt during the year partially offset by the repayment of shortterm debt during 2020 and an increase in share repurchase activity of 21 million 

funding and liquidity strategy 

our ability to fund our capital needs depends on our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access to bank financing and the capital markets as a result of uncertainties caused by the covid19 pandemic we continually evaluated aspects of our spending including capital expenditures strategic investments and dividends throughout 2020 additionally we committed to reducing our annual capital expenditures during the year we will continue to evaluate aspects of our spending in 2021 and anticipate our capital expenditures will gradually begin to increase to normal levels during the year as the markets we operate in recover in 2020 we elected to utilize certain federal state and foreign tax programs related to timing of tax payments and deductions to further manage our liquidity and the liabilities associated with these programs are appropriately classified in the applicable accrued and other current liabilities or other noncurrent accrued liabilities accounts in our consolidated balance sheets 

historically we have generated operating cash flow sufficient to fund our primary cash needs as the uncertainty and severity associated with the global spread of the covid19 pandemic continued to grow throughout 2020 xylem issued senior notes of 1 billion in aggregate principal green bond on june 26 2020 the primary longterm intention of incurring this debt is to fund green projects across our business segments as well as manage liquidity risk and increase flexibility as the duration of the economic effects of the pandemic are uncertain see note 15 credit facilities and debt of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our credit facilities and longterm debt xylems liquidity position has continued to evolve favorably during 2020 and we will continue to monitor the economic effects of the covid19 pandemic and its impact on the companys future operating cash flows going forward if our cash flows from operations are less than we expect we may need to incur debt or issue equity from time to time we may need to access the longterm and shortterm capital markets to obtain financing our access to and the availability of financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors including i our credit ratings or absence of a credit rating ii the liquidity of the overall capital markets and iii the current state of the economy there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or that such financing will be available at all our securities are rated investment grade a 

significant change in credit rating could impact our ability to borrow at favorable rates refer to note 15 credit facilities and debt of our consolidated financial statements for a description of limitations on obtaining additional funding 

we monitor our global funding requirements and seek to meet our liquidity needs on a costeffective basis as of december 31 2020 the covid19 pandemic has not materially impacted our borrowing costs or other costs of capital however the future impact of the covid19 pandemic is uncertain and may increase our borrowing costs and other costs of capital and otherwise adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we have considered the impacts of the covid19 pandemic on our liquidity and capital resources and do not currently expect it to impact our ability to meet future liquidity needs or continue to comply with debt covenants to provide for continued access to the full capacity of our credit facilities going forward xylem entered into amendment no 1 to the 2019 credit facility as defined in note 15 credit facilities and debt on june 22 2020 which modified the covenant calculation methodology through the quarter ending september 30 2021 and restricts stock repurchases until march 31 2021 except for shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued after the date of the amendment subject to customary exceptions see note 15 credit facilities and debt of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our credit facilities and longterm debt 

based on our current global cash positions cash flows from operations and access to the capital markets we believe there is sufficient liquidity to meet our funding requirements and service debt and other obligations in both the us and outside of the us over the next 12 months in addition we believe our existing committed credit facilities and access to the public debt markets would provide further liquidity if required currently we have available liquidity of approximately 27 billion consisting of 19 billion of cash and 800 million of available credit facilities as disclosed in note 15 credit facilities and debt of our consolidated financial statements our debt repayment obligations in 2021 consist of 600 million in senior notes which we expect to pay out of cash our next longterm debt maturity is march 2023 

risk related to these items are described in our risk factor disclosures referenced under “item 1a risk factors 

credit facilities  longterm contractual commitments 

see note 15 credit facilities and debt of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our credit facilities and longterm debt 

nonus operations 

for 2020 and 2019 we generated 53 and 51 of our revenue from nonus operations respectively as we continue to grow our operations in the emerging markets and elsewhere outside of the us we expect to continue to generate significant revenue from nonus operations and expect that a substantial portion of our cash will be predominately held by our foreign subsidiaries we expect to manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed we may transfer cash from certain international subsidiaries to the us and other international subsidiaries when we believe it is costeffective to do so we continually review our domestic and foreign cash profile expected future cash generation and investment opportunities and reassess whether there is a need to repatriate funds held internationally to support our us operations as of december 31 2020 we have provided a deferred tax liability of 7 million for net foreign withholding taxes and state income taxes on 500 million of earnings expected to be repatriated to the us parent as deemed necessary in the future 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual commitments as of december 31 2020 



in addition to the amounts presented in the table above we have recorded liabilities for net investment hedges of 117 million and employee severance indemnities of 17 million these amounts have been excluded from the contractual obligations table due to an inability to reasonably estimate the timing or amounts of such payments in individual years further benefit payments which reflect expected future service related to the companys pension and other postretirement employee benefit obligations are presented in note 16 “postretirement benefit plans” of the consolidated financial statements and deferred income tax liabilities and uncertain tax positions are presented in note 7 income taxes of the consolidated financial statements and as such these obligations are not included in the above table finally estimated environmental payments and workers compensation and general liability reserves are excluded from the table above we estimate based on historical experience that we will spend approximately 1 million to 2 million per year on environmental investigation and remediation and approximately 5 million to 6 million per year on workers compensation and general liability at december 31 2020 we had estimated and accrued 3 million and 20 million related to environmental matters and workers compensation and general liability respectively 

1 refer to note 15 “credit facilities and debt” of the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the use and availability of debt and revolving credit agreements amounts represent principal payments of shortterm and longterm debt including current maturities and exclude unamortized discounts 

2 amounts represent estimates of future interest payments on shortterm and longterm debt outstanding as of december 31 2020 

3 refer to note 11 leases of the consolidated financial statements for further lease discussion 

4 represents unconditional purchase agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms to purchase goods or services including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction purchase agreements that are able to cancel without penalty have been excluded 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2020 we have issued guarantees for the debt and other obligations of consolidated subsidiaries in the normal course of business we have determined that none of these arrangements has a material current effect or is reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our consolidated financial statements financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

we obtain certain standby letters of credit bank guarantees and surety bonds from thirdparty financial institutions in the ordinary course of business when required under contracts or to satisfy insurance related requirements as of december 31 2020 the amount of surety bonds bank guarantees insurance letters of credit and standby letters of credit was 378 million 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 

significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are discussed in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” of the consolidated financial statements accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they are inherently uncertain involve significant judgments include areas where 

different estimates reasonably could have been used and changes in the estimates that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable however actual results in these areas could differ from management’s estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

revenue recognition xylem recognizes revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of promised goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which it expects to be entitled for providing those goods and services for each arrangement with a customer we identify the contract and the associated performance obligations within the contract determine the transaction price of that contract allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation and recognize revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied 

the satisfaction of performance obligations in a contract is based upon when the customer obtains control over the asset depending on the nature of the performance obligation control transfers either at a particular point in time or over time which determines the recognition pattern of revenue 

for product sales other than longterm constructiontype contracts we recognize revenue once control has passed at a point in time which is generally when products are shipped in instances where contractual terms include a provision for customer acceptance revenue is recognized when either i we have previously demonstrated that the product meets the specified criteria based on either seller or customerspecified objective criteria or ii upon formal acceptance received from the customer where the product has not been previously demonstrated to meet customerspecified objective criteria we recognize revenue on product sales to channel partners including resellers distributors or valueadded solution providers at the point in time when the risks and rewards possession and title have transferred to the customer which usually occurs at the point of delivery 

revenue from performance obligations related to services is primarily recognized over time as the performance obligations are satisfied in these instances the customer consumes the benefit of the service as xylem performs 

certain businesses also enter into longterm constructiontype sales contracts where revenue is recognized over time in these instances revenue is recognized using a measure of progress that applies an input method based on costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs we also recognize revenue for certain of these arrangements using the output method and measure progress based on shipments of product where control has transferred to the customer 

for all contracts with customers we determine the transaction price in the arrangement and allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation identified in the contract judgment is required to determine the appropriate unit of account and we separate out the performance obligations if they are capable of being distinct and are distinct within the context of the contract the transaction price is adjusted for our estimate of variable consideration which may include a right of return discounts rebates penalties and retainage to estimate variable consideration we apply the expected value or the most likely amount method based on whichever method most appropriately predicts the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to the method applied is typically based on historical experience and known trends we constrain the amounts of variable consideration that are included in the transaction price to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur or when uncertainties around the variable consideration are resolved 

income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities applying enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences will reverse based on the evaluation of available evidence we recognize future tax benefits such as net operating loss carryforwards to the extent that we believe it is more likely than not we will realize these benefits we periodically assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets and reflect any changes to our estimate of the amount we are more likely than not to realize in the valuation allowance with a corresponding adjustment to earnings or other comprehensive income as appropriate 

in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we look to the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences taxable income in carryback years and the feasibility of tax planning strategies and estimated future taxable income the valuation allowance can be affected by changes to tax laws changes to statutory tax rates and changes to future taxable income estimates 

due to the us tax cuts and jobs act tax act we have recorded net foreign withholding taxes and state income taxes on earnings that are expected to be repatriated to the us parent we have not recorded any deferred taxes on the amounts that the company currently does not intend to repatriate as the determination of any deferred taxes on this amount is not practicable 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities 

for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due furthermore we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities or upon completion of the litigation process based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 

we adjust our liability for uncertain tax positions in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional tax expense would result if a payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 

business combinations we record acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting all of the assets acquired liabilities assumed contractual contingencies and contingent consideration is recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill the application of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in order to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill these assumptions and estimates include a market participant’s use of the asset and the appropriate discount rates for a market participant our estimates are based on historical experience information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and when appropriate includes assistance from independent thirdparty appraisal firms significant assumptions and estimates include but are not limited to the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future the cost to buildrecreate certain technology the appropriate weightedaverage cost of capital and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable in addition unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates 

goodwill and intangible assets we review goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable we also review the carrying value of our finitelived intangible assets for potential impairment when impairment indicators arise we conduct our annual impairment test as of the first day of the fourth quarter for goodwill the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is not impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value then an impairment charge is recognized for that excess up to the amount of recorded goodwill we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using an income approach we estimate the fair value of our intangible assets with indefinite lives using either the income approach or the market approach under the income approach we calculate fair value based on the present value of estimated future cash flows under the market approach we calculate fair value based on recent sales and selling prices of similar assets 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinitelived intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions particularly related to future operating results and cash flows these estimates and assumptions include but are not limited to revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates assumed royalty rates future economic and market conditions and identification of appropriate market comparable data in addition the identification of reporting units and the allocation of assets and liabilities to the reporting units when determining the carrying value of each reporting unit also require judgment goodwill is tested for impairment at either the operating segment identified in note 22 “segment and geographic data” of the consolidated financial statements or one level below the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets is based on estimates and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable significant changes to these estimates and assumptions could adversely impact our conclusions actual future results may differ from those estimates 

in the third quarter of 2020 management updated forecasts of future cash flows for the aia businesses which reflect significant negative volume impacts from the covid19 pandemic primarily on our assessment services business our ongoing investment in the aia businesses also continues to impact near term profitability based on these factors we determined that there were indicators that the aia reporting unit’s goodwill may be impaired and accordingly we performed an interim goodwill impairment test as of july 1 2020 the results of the impairment test showed that the fair value of the aia reporting unit was lower than the carrying value resulting in a 58 million 

goodwill impairment charge as of december 31 2020 the remaining goodwill balance in our aia reporting unit after recording the goodwill impairment charge was 113 million 

also during the third quarter of 2020 due to the factors discussed above we assessed whether the carrying amounts of the aia reporting unit’s longlived assets may not be recoverable and therefore impaired our assessment resulted in an impairment charge of 11 million primarily related to software and proprietary technology the charge was calculated using an income approach 

the uncertainty of the future impact of the covid19 pandemic may also contribute to further deterioration of our future cash flows if we do not achieve our forecasts it is possible that the goodwill of the aia reporting unit could be deemed to be impaired again in a future period the risks and potential impacts of covid19 on the fair value of our assets are included in our risk factor disclosures referenced under “item 1a risk factors 

during the fourth quarter of 2020 we performed our annual impairment assessment and determined that the estimated fair values of our goodwill reporting units were substantially in excess of each of their carrying values however future goodwill impairment tests could result in a charge to earnings we will continue to evaluate goodwill on an annual basis as of the beginning of our fourth quarter and whenever events and changes in circumstances require us to do so we determined that no impairment of the indefinitelived intangibles existed as of the measurement date in 2020 however future indefinitelived intangible impairment tests could result in a charge to earnings we will continue to evaluate indefinitelived intangibles on an annual basis as of the beginning of our fourth quarter and whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate there may be a potential impairment 

postretirement benefit plans company employees around the world participate in numerous defined benefit plans the determination of projected benefit obligations and the recognition of expenses related to these plans are dependent on various assumptions these major assumptions primarily relate to discount rates expected longterm rates of return on plan assets rate of future compensation increases mortality years of service and other factors some of which are disclosed in note 16 “postretirement benefit plans” of the consolidated financial statements actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized on a straightline basis only to the extent they exceed 10 of the higher of the marketrelated value or projected benefit obligation over the average remaining service period of active plan participants or for plans with all or substantially all inactive participants over the average remaining life expectancy 

significant assumptions 

management develops each assumption using relevant company experience in conjunction with marketrelated data for each individual country in which such plans exist all assumptions are reviewed annually with thirdparty consultants and are adjusted as necessary the table included below provides the weighted average assumptions used to estimate our defined benefit pension obligations and costs as of and for the years ended 2020 and 2019 



nm not meaningful the pension benefits for future service for all the us pension plans are based on years of service and not impacted by future compensation increases 

we determine the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets by evaluating both historical returns and estimates of future returns specifically the company analyzes the estimated future returns based on independent estimates of asset class returns and evaluates historical broad market returns over longterm timeframes based on the strategic asset allocation which is detailed in note 16 “postretirement benefit plans” of the consolidated financial statements 

based on the approach described above the chart below shows weighted average actual returns versus the weighted average expected longterm rates of return for our pension plans that were utilized in the calculation of the net periodic pension cost for each respective year 



for the recognition of net periodic pension cost the calculation of the expected return on plan assets is generally derived by applying the expected longterm rate of return to the marketrelated value of plan assets the marketrelated value of plan assets is based on average asset values at the measurement date over the last five years the use of fair value rather than a calculated value could materially affect net periodic pension cost the weighted average expected longterm rate of return for all of our plan assets to be used in determining net periodic benefit costs for 2021 is estimated at 324 we estimate that every 25 basis point change in the expected return on plan assets impacts the expense by 1 million 

the discount rate reflects our expectation of the present value of expected future cash payments for benefits at the measurement date a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense we base the discount rate assumption on current investment yields of highquality fixed income investments during the retirement benefits maturity period the pension discount rate was determined by considering an interest rate yield curve comprising aaaaa bonds with maturities between zero and 30 years developed by the plan’s actuaries annual benefit payments are then discounted to present value using this yield curve to develop a singlepoint discount rate matching the plan’s characteristics our weighted average discount rate for all pension plans effective january 1 2021 is 121 we estimate that every 25 basis point change in the discount rate impacts the expense b y 2 million 

the rate of future compensation increase assumption reflects our longterm actual experience and future and nearterm outlook effective january 1 2021 our expected rate of future compensation is 291 for all pension plans the estimated impact of a 25 basis point change in the expected rate of future compensation is less than 1 million 

the company has initiated the process for a full buyout of its largest defined benefit plan in the uk upon completion of the buyout expected in 2021 we expect a material settlement charge primarily consisting of unrecognized actuarial losses 

we currently anticipate making contributions to our pension and postretirement benefit plans in the range of 19 million to 27 million during 2021 we also anticipate an estimated payment of approximately 1517 million for the buyout of the uk pension plan approximately 6 million of contributions are expected to be made in the first quarter 

funded status 

funded status is derived by subtracting the respective yearend values of the projected benefit obligations from the fair value of plan assets we estimate that every 25 basis point change in the discount rate impacts the funded status by approximately 42 million 

fair value of plan assets 

the plan assets of our pension plans comprise a broad range of investments including domestic and foreign equity securities interests in hedge funds fixed income investments insurance contracts and cash and cash equivalents 

a portion of our pension benefit plan assets portfolio comprises investments in hedge funds which are generally measured at net asset value however in certain instances the values reported by the asset managers were not current at the measurement date accordingly we made estimate adjustments to the last reported value where necessary to measure the assets at fair value at the measurement date these adjustments consider information received from the asset managers as well as general market information the adjustment recorded at december 31 2020 and 2019 for these assets represented less than one percent of total plan assets in each respective year asset values for other positions were generally measured using market observable prices we estimate that a 5 change in asset values will impact funded status by approximately 32 million

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates these exposures are actively monitored by management our exposure to foreign exchange rate risk is due to certain costs revenue and borrowings being denominated in currencies other than one of our subsidiaries functional currency similarly we are exposed to market risk as a result of changes in interest rates which may affect the cost of our financing it is our policy and practice to use derivative financial instruments only to the extent necessary to manage exposures 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we conduct approximately 53 of our business in various locations outside the us 

our economic foreign currency risk primarily relates to receipts from customers payments to suppliers and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies we may use derivative financial instruments to offset risk related to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers when it is believed that the exposure will not be limited by our normal operating and financing activities we enter into currency forward contracts periodically in order to manage the exchange rate fluctuation risk on certain intercompany transactions associated with thirdparty sales and purchases these risks are also mitigated by natural hedges including the presence of manufacturing facilities outside the us global sourcing and other spending which occurs in foreign countries our principal foreign currency transaction exposures primarily relate to the euro swedish krona polish zloty canadian dollar british pound and australian dollar we estimate that a hypothetical 10 movement in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material economic impact to xylem’s financial position and results of operations 

additionally we are subject to foreign exchange translation risk due to changes in the value of foreign currencies in relation to our reporting currency the us dollar the translation risk is primarily concentrated in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro chinese yuan british pound canadian dollar australian dollar and swedish krona as the us dollar strengthens against other currencies in which we transact business revenue and income will generally be negatively impacted and if the us dollar weakens revenue and income will generally be positively impacted we expect to continue to generate significant revenue from nonus operations and we expect our cash will be predominately held by our foreign subsidiaries we expect to manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed we may transfer cash from certain international subsidiaries to the us and other international subsidiaries when it is costeffective to do so though we continually review our domestic and foreign cash profile expected future cash generation and investment opportunities and reassess whether there is a need to repatriate funds held internationally to support our us operations we also hedge our investment in certain foreign subsidiaries via the use of crosscurrency swaps and the designation of our 225 senior notes of €500 million aggregate principal amount due march 2023 as a net investment hedge accordingly we estimate that a 10 movement of the us dollar to various foreign currency exchange rates we translate from in aggregate would not have a material economic impact on our financial position and results of operations 

interest rate risk 

as of december 31 2020 our longterm debt portfolio is primarily comprised of five series of fixedrate senior notes that total approximately 25 billion the senior notes are not exposed to interest rate risk as the bonds are at a fixed rate until maturity based on the current interest rate market we do not anticipate material risk associated with our debt refinancing within the target time frame of maturity

our industry 

our planet faces serious water challenges less than 1 of the total water available on earth is fresh water and these supplies are under threat due to factors such as the draining of aquifers increased pollution and the effects of climate change demand for fresh water is rising rapidly due to population growth industrial expansion and increased agricultural development with consumption estimated to double every 20 years by 2025 more than 30 of the world’s population is expected to live in areas without adequate water supply even in developed countries with sufficient clean water supply existing water supply infrastructure is aging and often inefficient in the united states deteriorating pipe systems theft or inaccurate meters result in approximately one out of every six gallons of treated water being lost prior to reaching the end customer this problem of nonrevenue water is a major financial challenge of many utilities globally especially in developing markets where nonrevenue water can represent 10 to 60 or more of net water produced these and other challenges create opportunities for growth in the global water industry we estimate the total addressable market size to be approximately 560 billion  

global water needs cannot be met without streamlining the water industry’s cost structure with technologies that fundamentally change the provision and management of water we compete in areas that are pivotal to improving water affordability and resilience while reducing the impact of water scarcity water affordability refers to the more efficient delivery use and treatment of clean water and wastewater resilience refers to the management of waterrelated risks and the resilience of water infrastructure water scarcity refers to the management of limited supplies of water due to climate change overpopulation and pollution our customers often face all three of these challenges ranging from inefficient and aging water distribution networks and energyintensive or unreliable wastewater management systems which require improvements in “water affordability” droughts and pollution which limit the amount of water readily available causing water scarcity” or exposure to natural disasters such as floods or droughts which require improvements in “resilience” additionally we also provide solutions to enhance communications and efficiency improve safety and conserve resources to customers in the water electric gas and lighting sectors delivering value in these areas creates significant opportunity for the company we estimate our total served market size to be approximately 61 billion 

the global water industry value chain 

the water industry value chain includes equipment technology and services companies like xylem which address the unique challenges and demands of a diverse customer base this customer base includes water and wastewater utilities that supply treat and monitor clean water or transport treat and analyze wastewater or storm water through an infrastructure network and engineering procurement and construction or epc firms and third party contractors which work with utilities to design and build water and wastewater infrastructure networks as depicted below utilities and other customers require products solutions services technology and application expertise from their equipment technology and services providers to address trends such as rising pollution stricter regulations increasing operational costs and the increased outsourcing of process knowledge in addition to utilities equipment technology and service companies also provide distinct technologies and application expertise to a wide array of entities including farms mines power plants industrial facilities such as food and beverage and pharmaceutical manufacturers and residential and commercial customers seeking to address similar trends 

water industry supply chain 

business strategy 

our strategy is to enhance shareholder value by providing distinctive solutions for our customers most important water scarcity affordability and resilience challenges enabling us to grow revenue organically and through strategic acquisitions as we streamline our cost structure key elements of our strategy are summarized below 



while also continuing to optimize our cost structure through business simplification which aims to eliminate structural process and product complexity 

 business segments distribution and competitive landscape 

we have t hree reportable business segments that are aligned around the critical market applications they provide water infrastructure applied water and measurement  control solutions see note 22  “segment and geographic data” in our consolidated financial statements for financial information about segments and geographic areas 

the table and descriptions below provide an overview of our business segments 

water infrastructure 

our water infrastructure segment primarily supports the process that collects water from a source treats it and distributes it to users and then treats and returns the wastewater responsibly to the environment through two closely linked applications transport and treatment the transport application also includes sales and rental of 

specialty dewatering pumps and related equipment and services which provide the safe removal or draining of groundwater and surface water from construction sites or other industrial sites and bypass pumping for the repair of aging utility infrastructure as well as emergency water transport and removal during severe weather events 

the customer base consists of two primary end markets utility and industrial the utility market includes public private and publicprivate entities that support water wastewater and storm water networks the industrial market includes customers who require similar water and wastewater infrastructure networks to support various industrial operations 

water infrastructure sells primarily through direct channels with remaining sales through indirect channels and service capabilities both utility and industrial facility customers increasingly require our teams’ global but locally proficient expertise to use our equipment in their specific applications several trends are increasing demand for this application expertise i the increase in both the type and amount of contaminants found in the water supply ii increasing environmental regulations iii the need to increase system efficiencies to optimize energy and other operational costs iv the retirement of an aging water industry workforce that has not been systematically renewed at utilities and other enduser customers and v the buildout of water infrastructure in the emerging markets we estimate our served market size in this sector to be approximately 18 billion 

given the highly fragmented nature of the water industry the water infrastructure segment competes with a large number of businesses we differentiate ourselves in the market by focusing on product and service performance quality and reliability innovation speed to market with new or disruptive technologies application expertise brand reputation energy efficiency product lifecycle cost timeliness of delivery proximity of service centers effectiveness of our distribution channels and price in the sale or rental of products and provision of services we benefit from our large installed base which requires maintenance repair and replacement parts due to the critical application and nature of the products and the conditions under which they operate timeliness of delivery quality and the proximity of service centers are important customer considerations when selecting a provider for aftermarket products and services as well as equipment rentals in geographic regions where we are locally positioned to provide a quick response customers have historically relied on us rather than our competitors for aftermarket products relating to our highly engineered and customized solutions our key competitors in the water infrastructure segment include ksb inc sulzer ltd evoqua water technologies united rentals trojan danaher corporation and grundfos among others 

applied water 

applied water encompasses the uses of water in two primarily applications building services and industrial water these applications serve a diverse set of end markets including residential commercial and industrial residential consumers represent the end users in the residential market while owners and managers of properties such as apartment buildings retail stores institutional buildings restaurants schools hospitals and hotels are examples of end users in the commercial market the industrial market includes oems exploration and production firms and developers and managers of industrial facilities such as electrical power generators chemical manufacturers machine shops clothing manufacturers food and beverage companies and car washes 

in the applied water segment end markets vary widely and as a result specialized distribution partners are often preferred as such the applied water segment provides the majority of its sales through strong indirect channels with the remaining sales going through our global direct sales channels we have longstanding relationships with many of the leading independent distributors in the markets we serve and we provide incentives to distributors such as specialized loyalty and training programs 

we estimate our served market size in this sector to be approximately 19 billion population growth urbanization and regulatory requirements are macro growth drivers of these markets driving the need for housing food community services and retail goods within growing city centers 

competition in the applied water segment focuses on brand equity application expertise product delivery performance and energy efficiency quality and price we compete by offering a wide variety of innovative and highquality products coupled with worldclass application expertise we believe our distribution through wellestablished channels and our reputation for quality significantly enhance our market position our ability to deliver innovative product offerings has enabled us to compete effectively to cultivate and maintain customer relationships and to serve and expand into many niche and new markets our key competitors in the applied water segment include grundfos wilo se pentair plc and franklin electric co inc 

measurement  control solutions 

measurement  control solutions develops advanced technology solutions that enable intelligent use and conservation of critical water and energy resources the segment delivers communications smart metering measurement and control technologies and critical infrastructure technologies that allow customers to more effectively use their distribution networks for the delivery monitoring and control of critical resources such as water electricity and natural gas we also provide analytical instrumentation used to measure and analyze water quality flow and level in clean water wastewater surface water and coastal environments additionally we offer software and services including cloudbased analytics remote monitoring and data management leak detection condition assessment asset management and pressure monitoring solutions we also offer smart lighting solutions that improve efficiency and public safety efforts across communities 

at the heart of our leading technologies is automation data management and decision support communications networks automate and optimize meter reading monitor flow rates and detect and enable rapid response to changing and unsafe conditions in short they provide insight into operations and enable our customers to manage the entire scope of their operations remotely through their networks at the center of our offering is the flexnet communication network which provides a common communications platform and infrastructure for essential metering services this twoway communication technology remotely connects a wide variety of smart points in a given network with protocols frequently on federal communications commission fcc licensed spectrum in the united states that enable reliable resilient and secure transmissions these technologies allow our customers to remotely and continuously monitor their water gas or electric distribution infrastructure prioritize and manage maintenance and use data to optimize all aspects of their networks our advanced infrastructure analytics complement these offerings with intelligent solutions that help utility decisionmakers manage and maintain their networks more effectively in real time 

the majority of our sales in the united states is conducted through strong longstanding relationships with leading distributors and dedicated channel partners for water gas and electric markets internationally direct sales are often made in markets without established distribution channels however some distribution channels are used in more developed markets a more direct sales approach with key account management is employed for large utilities and government programs 

we estimate our served market size in this sector to be approximately 24 billion macro growth drivers include increasing regulation aging infrastructure and worldwide movement towards smart grid implementation water scarcity and conservation as well as the need to prevent revenue loss via inaccurate meter readings leaks or theft are among the drivers of smart meter and leak detection technologies 

our sensusbranded meters are well positioned in the smart metering sector the fastest growing sector of the global meter industry we set ourselves apart in the industry by focusing on our communication network innovation new product development and service offerings that deliver tangible savings of nonrevenue water through improved meter accuracy reduced theft and identification of leaks our pure technologies’ equipment and services are also well positioned in the leak detection sector which is attracting considerable attention as aging infrastructure and increased regulatory scrutiny exert pressure on operating budgets our key competitors in the measurement  control solutions segment include itron badger meter landisgyr neptune roper elster honeywell echologics mueller water products hach danaher corporation and teledyne 

geographic profile 

the table below illustrates the annual revenue and percentage of revenue by geographic area for each of the three years ended december 31 

in addition to the traditional markets of the united states and western europe opportunities in emerging markets within asia pacific eastern europe latin america and other countries are growing revenue derived from emerging markets comprised approximately 20 of our revenue in each of the last three years 

supply and seasonality 

we have a global manufacturing and assembly footprint with production facilities in europe north america latin america asia and the middle east our inventory management and distribution practices seek to minimize inventory holding periods by striving to take delivery of the inventory and manufacturing as close as possible to the sale or distribution of products to our customers all of our businesses require various parts and raw materials the availability and prices of which may fluctuate parts and raw materials commonly used in our products include motors fabricated parts castings bearings seals batteries pcbs and electronic components as well as steel brass nickel copper aluminum and plastics while we may recover some cost increases through operational improvements we are still exposed to some pricing risk including increased pricing risk due to duty and tariff assessments by the united states on foreign imports we attempt to control costs through fixedpriced contracts with suppliers and various other programs such as our global procurement initiative 

our business relies on thirdparty suppliers contract manufacturing and commodity markets to secure raw materials parts and components used in our products we typically acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our materials requirements for many of our products we have existing alternate sources of supply or such sources may be readily available 

we may experience price volatility or supply constraints for materials that are not available from multiple sources from time to time we acquire certain inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longerterm pricing commitments with suppliers to improve the priority price and availability of supply there have been no raw material shortages in the past several years that have had a significant adverse impact on our business as a whole 

our business segments experience a modest level of seasonality in their operations this seasonality is dependent on factors such as customers capital spending as well as climate change and weather conditions including heavy flooding droughts and fluctuations in temperatures all of which can positively or negatively impact portions of our business 

customers 

our business is not dependent on any single customer or a few customers the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our company no individual customer accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated revenues in 2019  2018 or 2017

backlog includes orders on hand as well as contractual customer agreements at the end of the period delivery schedules vary from customer to customer based on their requirements annual or multiyear contracts are subject to rescheduling and cancellation by customers due to the longterm nature of the contracts as such beginning total backlog plus orders minus revenues will not equal ending total backlog due to contract adjustments foreign currency fluctuations and other factors typically large projects require longer lead production cycles and deployment schedules and delays can occur from time to time total backlog was 1801 million at december 31 2019 and 1689 million at december 31 2018  we anticipate that approximately 60 of the backlog at december 31 2019 will be recognized as revenue during 2020  

research and development 

research and development “rd” is a key foundation of our growth strategy and we focus on the design and development of products and application knowhow that anticipate customer needs and emerging trends our engineers are involved in new product development as well as improvement of existing products to increase customer value our businesses invest substantial resources into rd we anticipate we will continue to develop and invest in our rd capabilities to promote a steady flow of innovative highquality and reliable products and integrated solutions to further strengthen our position in the markets we serve in addition to investments made in software development which were capitalized we incurred 191 million  189 million  and 181 million as a result of rd investment spending in 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively 

we have rd and product development capabilities around the world rd activities are initially conducted in our technology centers located in conjunction with some of our major manufacturing facilities to ensure an efficient and robust development process we have several global technical centers and local development teams around the world where we are supporting global needs and accelerating the customization of our products and solutions to address local needs in some cases our rd activities are conducted at our piloting and testing facilities and at strategic customer sites these piloting and testing facilities enable us to serve our strategic markets globally as 

part of expanding our bandwidth and to increase our access to technology we have built innovation ecosystem partnerships with academic institutions startup accelerators and venture capital organizations 

capitalized software 

we capitalize software developed for sale to external customers which is included within other intangible assets net on our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2019 and 2018 we had net capitalized software for sale to external customers of 165 million and 128 million respectively 

intellectual property 

we generally seek patent protection for those inventions and improvements that we believe will improve our competitive position we believe that our patents and applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and improving our return on rd investments while we own control or license a significant number of patents trade secrets proprietary information trademarks trade names copyrights and other intellectual property rights which in the aggregate are of material importance to our business management believes that our business as a whole as well as each of our core business segments is not materially dependent on any one intellectual property right or related group of such rights 

patents patent applications and license agreements expire or terminate over time by operation of law in accordance with their terms or otherwise as the portfolio of our patents patent applications and license agreements has evolved over time we do not expect the expiration of any specific patent to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

environmental matters and regulation 

our global operations are subject to various laws and regulations governing the environment such as those promulgated by the united states environmental protection agency and similar state and foreign environmental agencies including the discharge of pollutants and the management and disposal of hazardous substances while environmental laws and regulations are subject to change such changes can be difficult to predict reliably and the timing of potential changes is uncertain management does not believe based on current circumstances that compliance costs pursuant to such regulations will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations however the effect of future legislative or regulatory changes could be material to our financial condition or results of operations 

we continue to be dedicated to environmental and sustainability programs to minimize the use of natural resources and reduce the utilization and generation of hazardous materials from our processes and to remediate identified environmental concerns as to the latter we are currently engaged in site investigations and remediation activities to address environmental cleanup from past operations at current and former manufacturing facilities we do not anticipate these liabilities will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations at december 31 2019  we had estimated and accrued 3 million related to environmental matters 

sustainability 

at xylem sustainability is at the center of who we are and what we do as a leading global water technology company we address one of the world’s most urgent sustainability challenges  responsible stewardship of our shared water resources technology is playing an increasingly important role in helping the world solve water issues we have a long history of innovation and we are focusing on the powerful capabilities of smart technology integrated management and data analytics 

we believe our financial performance and commitment to sustainability go hand in hand xylem approaches business sustainability as a way to generate economic value while also creating value for society thus meeting the needs of both accordingly in 2019 we evolved our approach to leverage sustainability in our decisionmaking toward longterm value for our shareholders customers employees and communities in which we operate and announced an ambitious new slate of 2025 sustainability goals these new goals can be found in our 2018 sustainability report which is published using the global reporting initiative gri framework 

in setting our 2025 sustainability goals we also aligned them with the united nations sustainable development goals unsdgs not only to substantiate our contribution to achieving global objectives but also to be transparent in our communication to stakeholders by providing details on our responsibility to build a sustainable future while xylem embraces all 17 of the unsdgs we have a special focus on sdg6 clean water and sanitation

 item 1a risk factors 

in evaluating our business the following discussion of significant factors events and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky should be carefully considered along with all of the other information in this report and in our other filings with the sec the events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could in circumstances that we may not be able to accurately predict recognize or control have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flow results of operations or market price of our common stock 

these risk factors do not identify all the risks we face we operate in a continually changing business economic and geopolitical environment and as a result new risk factors may emerge from time to time we could also be affected by factors events or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks in addition the global economic and geopolitical climate amplifies many of these risks 

risks related to our business 

failure to compete successfully in our markets and disruptive technologies could adversely affect our business 

we offer our technologies products and services in competitive markets we believe the principal points of competition in our markets are product and service performance quality and reliability innovation speed to market with new or disruptive technologies and business models application expertise brand reputation energy efficiency product security product life cycle cost timeliness of delivery proximity of service centers effectiveness of our distribution channels price and customers’ experience in conducting business with us maintaining and improving our competitive position will require successful management of these factors in a business environment with increasingly rapid rates of change and disruption including our continued investment in talent manufacturing technology and innovation research and development engineering sales and marketing customer service and support and our distribution networks our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors including our ability to i develop and maintain competitive products services business models and customer experience to address emerging trends and customer needs in our target markets ii defend our market share against an everexpanding number of competitors many of which are new and nontraditional competitors from outside our industry such as major technology firms or those out of emerging markets iii enhance our product and service offerings by adding innovative features or disruptive technologies that differentiate them from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization iv develop manufacture and bring compelling new products and services to market quickly and costeffectively and v attract develop and retain individuals with the requisite innovation and technical expertise and understanding of customers’ needs to develop new technologies and introduce new products and services 

we may not be successful in maintaining our competitive position our competitors or third parties from outside our industry may develop disruptive technologies products and services more quickly than us or that are superior to ours may develop new or more efficient or effective methods or business models to provide technologies products and services or may adapt more quickly than we do to new trends disruptive technologies or evolving customer requirements the failure of our technologies products or services to maintain and gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings as well as customers’ slowerthanexpected adoption of and investment in our new and innovative technologies could significantly reduce our revenues or market share and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects pricing pressures also could cause us to adjust the prices of certain products to stay competitive which could adversely affect our market share and financial performance failure to continue competing successfully or to win large contracts could adversely affect our business financial condition cash flow or results of operations 

our business products and services could be adversely affected by cyber threats or other interruptions in information technology communications networks and operations 

our business operations rely on information technology and communications networks some of which are operated by third parties including increasingly cloudbased service providers to process transmit and store our electronic information including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personal data relating to employees customers or other business partners we have or operate through a concentration of operations on certain sites such as production and shared service centers we also rely on third parties’ information technology systems to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities regardless of protection measures essentially all systems are susceptible to damage disruption or shutdown due to cybersecurity attacks including ransomware denialofservice computer viruses and security breaches as well as human error or malfeasance equipment or system failure including due to maintenance obsolescence or age vandalism natural disasters fire power or communication outages shutdown telecommunication or utility failure and other events in 

any such circumstances our system redundancy and other business continuity and disaster recovery planning and response may be ineffective or inadequate 

in addition we offer certain services and products including pumps controllers and meters used by third parties for operational purposes or to collect data which are digitallyenabled or connect to and are part of the “internet of things” iot cybersecurity attacks may target hardware software and information installed stored or transmitted by our products after they have been purchased and incorporated into thirdparties’ products facilities or infrastructure while we attempt to provide security measures to safeguard our products and services from cyber threats the potential for an attack remains a successful attack may result in the misappropriation destruction unauthorized access to or disclosure of third parties confidential information damage disruption or shutdown of third parties’ operations recall of our products or increased costs for security and remediation as well as possible damage to our brand reputation 

like many multinational corporations we and some third parties upon which we rely have experienced cybersecurity attacks on information technology networks and systems products and services in the past and may experience them in the future likely with more frequency and involving a broader range of devices and modes of attack to date none have resulted in any material adverse impact to our business operations products services or customers we have adopted measures designed to mitigate potential risks associated with cybersecurity threats breaches or other disruptions or damage to our information technology networks and systems products and services but the unpredictability of the timing nature and scope of such disruptions and threats could impact our business operations products and services disruption to any of the information technology and communications networks on which we rely or an attack on our products and services could interfere with our operations disrupt our supply chain and service to our customers interrupt production and shipments result in theft or compromise of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets damage employee customer and business partner relationships negatively impact our reputation result in legal claims and proceedings or regulatory enforcement actions and increase our costs for security and remediation any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

although we continue to assess these risks implement controls and perform business continuity and disaster recovery planning we cannot be sure that cybersecurity attacks or other interruptions with material adverse effects will not occur 

our results of operations and financial condition are subject to global economic geopolitical and financial market conditions 

we compete around the world in various geographic and product markets in 2019  49  24 and 20 of our total revenue was from customers located in the united states western europe and emerging markets respectively we expect revenue from these markets to be significant for the foreseeable future important factors impacting our businesses include the overall strength of these economies and our customers’ confidence in both local and global macroeconomic conditions instability and uncertainties from the global geopolitical environment industrial and private sector spending federal state local and municipal governmental fiscal and trade policies the strength of the residential and commercial real estate markets interest rates availability of commercial financing for our customers and endusers the availability of funding for our public sector customers and unemployment rates a slowdown or prolonged downturn in the global economy or our markets has in the past and could have in the future a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flow and results of operations 

we are exposed to economic geopolitical and other risks associated with our international sales and operations 

in 2019  51 of our total revenue was from customers outside the united states with 20 of total revenue generated in emerging markets we expect our sales from international operations and export sales to continue to be a significant portion of our revenue we have placed a particular emphasis on increasing our growth and presence in emerging markets many of our manufacturing operations employees and suppliers are located outside of the united states both our international operations and sales are subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside the united states these risks include the following 



 changes in the geopolitical or economic environments in the countries and regions in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows for example changes in united states policy regarding international trade including import and export regulation and international trade agreements could negatively impact our business the united states tariffs imposed on certain goods imported from china and certain other countries has resulted in retaliatory tariffs by china and other countries additional tariffs imposed by the united states on a broader range of imports from china or other countries goods or further retaliatory trade measures taken by china or other countries in response could result in a continued increase in supply chain costs that we may not be able to offset or may otherwise adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 

additionally we continue to monitor the potential impacts brexit on our results of operations and financial condition volatility in foreign currencies is expected to continue as the united kingdom executes its exit from the european union if the united kingdom and the european union cannot conclude an agreement on their future relationship before the end of the transition period referred to as a “hard brexit” trade would be based on world trade organization rules which would likely lead to increased costs from reimposition of tariffs on trade between the united kingdom and european union increased transportation costs shipping delays because of the need for customs inspections and procedures and shortages of certain goods the united kingdom will also need to negotiate its own trade treaties with countries all over the world which could take years to complete in the case of a “hard brexit” our exposure to disruptions to our supply chain increased costs the imposition of tariffs and currency devaluation in the united kingdom could result in a material impact to our consolidated revenue earnings and cash flow 

further any payment of distributions loans or advances to us by our foreign subsidiaries could be subject to restrictions on or taxation of dividends or repatriation of earnings under applicable local law monetary transfer restrictions and foreign currency exchange regulations in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate in addition to the general risks that we face outside the united states our operations in emerging markets could involve additional uncertainties for us including risks that governments may impose withholding or other taxes on remittances and other payments to us or the amount of any such taxes may increase governments may seek to nationalize our assets or governments may impose or increase investment barriers or other restrictions affecting our business in addition emerging markets pose other uncertainties including the difficulty of enforcing agreements challenges collecting receivables protecting our intellectual property and other assets pressure on the pricing of our products and services higher business conduct risks ability to hire and retain qualified talent and risks of political instability we cannot predict the impact such events might have on our business financial condition cash flow and results of operations 

our business could be adversely affected by inflation tariffs and other manufacturing and operating cost increases 

our operating costs are subject to fluctuations particularly due to changes in prices for commodities parts raw materials energy and related utilities freight and cost of labor which may be driven by prevailing price levels exchange rates changes in trade protection measures including tariffs and other economic factors in order to remain competitive we may not be able to recover all or a portion of these higher costs from our customers through 

product price increases further in a declining price environment our operating margins may contract because we account for inventory using the firstin firstout method actions we take to mitigate volatility in manufacturing and operating costs may not be successful and as a result our business financial condition cash flow and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

a material disruption to any of our facilities or operations or that of third parties upon which we rely may adversely affect our business 

our facilities and operations rely on a complex global supply chain consisting of suppliers contract manufacturers and logistics providers in addition our business relies on certain third parties to supply critical business processes and activities including in the areas of finance human resources procurement and information technology if our facilities or operations of third parties upon which we rely in our supply chain and critical business operations were to be disrupted as a result of a significant equipment or system failure natural disaster power water or communications outage fire explosion critical supply failure terrorism cybersecurity attack political disruption outbreak of pandemics insurrection armed conflict or war labor dispute work stoppage or slowdown technology failure adverse weather conditions or other reason our financial performance operations and business could be adversely affected interruptions could cause an inability to meet customer demand or contractual commitments increase our costs reduce our sales and impact our business processes and activities including our ability to timely report financial results we also have or operate through a concentration of operations on certain sites such as production and shared services centers where business interruptions could cause material damage and costs any interruption in capability may be lengthy and have lasting effects require a significant amount of management and other employees time and focus and require us to make substantial expenditures to remedy the situation which could negatively affect our operations business processes and activities profitability and financial condition any recovery under our insurance policies may not offset the lost sales or increased costs that may be experienced during a disruption of operations or any resultant longerterm loss of suppliers sales or customers which could adversely affect our business financial condition cash flow and results of operations 

our business could be adversely affected by the availability of products parts and raw materials from our supply chain or the inability of suppliers to meet delivery requirements 

our business relies on thirdparty suppliers including contract manufacturing and commodity markets to secure select finished goods and raw materials parts and components used in our products and we expect that reliance to increase parts and raw materials commonly used in our products include motors fabricated parts castings bearings seals batteries pcbs and electronic components as well as steel brass nickel copper aluminum and plastics we are exposed to the availability of these parts materials and finished goods which may be subject to curtailment or change due to among other things changes in the strategy or production planning of suppliers including decisions to exit production of key components upon which we rely interruptions in production by suppliers labor disputes the impaired financial condition of a particular supplier suppliers’ capacity allocations to other purchasers changes in trade protection measures including tariffs exchange rates and prevailing price levels ability to meet regulatory requirements weather emergencies effects of pandemics or acts of war or terrorism any delay in our suppliers’ abilities to provide us with necessary materials could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers and accordingly could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring and realignment plans and our restructuring and realignment may adversely affect our business 

in recent fiscal years we have initiated restructuring and realignment plans in an effort to optimize our cost structure and improve our operational efficiency and effectiveness in 2017 we undertook steps to advance a multiyear effort to transform many of our support functions and related technologies including finance human resources and procurement challenges with the enabling technologies and delays in implementing planned restructuring and realignment activities have resulted in delayed realization of some the expected operational and financial benefits from such actions as such we may not be able to obtain all of the cost savings and benefits that were initially anticipated in connection with our restructuring and realignment plans additionally as a result of these plans we may experience a loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge or inefficiency during transitional periods and ongoing operations realignment and restructuring require a significant amount of management and other employees time and focus which may divert attention from operating and growing our business 

the successful implementation and execution of our restructuring and realignment actions are critical to achieving our expected cost savings as well as effectively competing in the marketplace and positioning us for future growth factors that may impede a successful implementation include the retention of key employees the impact of 

regulatory matters including tax matters involving certain thirdparty service providers selected to assist us including staffing technology and the service providers’ compliance with the companys internal controls over financial reporting and adverse economic market conditions if our restructuring and realignment actions are not executed successfully it could have a material adverse effect on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as well as our competitive position business financial condition cash flow and results of operations 

our strategy includes acquisitions and we may not be able to execute acquisitions of suitable candidates or integrate acquisitions successfully 

as part of our growth strategy we plan to continue to pursue the acquisition of other companies assets technologies product lines and customer channels that either complement or expand our existing business we may not be able to identify suitable candidates negotiate appropriate acquisition terms obtain financing that may be needed to consummate acquisitions complete proposed acquisitions successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or expand into new markets in addition we cannot make assurances that any acquisition will perform as planned be accretive to earnings or prove to be beneficial to our operations or cash flow 

acquisitions involve a number of risks and present financial managerial and operational challenges including diversion of management attention from existing businesses and operations integration of technology operations personnel and financial and other systems potentially insufficient cybersecurity controls insufficient internal controls over financial or compliance activities or financial reporting the failure to realize expected synergies the assumption of liabilities normally assumed with an acquisition as well as the possibility that we become exposed to substantial undisclosed liabilities or new material risks associated with the acquired businesses and the loss of key employees of the acquired businesses failure to successfully execute our growth strategy via acquisitions and successfully integrate these acquisitions could adversely affect our competitive position business financial condition or results of operations 

failure to comply with laws regulations and policies including but not limited to the us foreign corrupt practices act other applicable anticorruption legislation and data privacy and security laws could result in fines criminal penalties and an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

given our global operations we are subject to regulation under a wide variety of us federal and state and nonus laws regulations and policies including laws related to anticorruption trade regulations including export and import compliance antitrust and money laundering the us foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa the uk bribery act of 2010 and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from improper conduct of our employees or business partners in the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees or business partners have or may have violated applicable laws regulations or policies including anticorruption laws we are required to investigate the relevant facts and circumstances which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management any such violation could result in substantial fines sanctions civil andor criminal penalties termination of relationships with business partners and curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions and as a result might materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition in addition actual or alleged violations could damage our reputation and ability to do business 

additionally to conduct our operations we regularly move data across borders and consequently we are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in the united states such as the california consumer protection act and abroad regarding privacy data protection and data security the scope of the laws that may be applicable to us is often uncertain and may be conflicting particularly with respect to foreign laws for example the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of european union law and adds a broad array of requirements for handling personal data including the enforcement of data subject rights and public disclosure of significant data breaches other countries such as china have enacted or are enacting data localization and security laws that require data to stay within their borders all of these evolving legal and operational requirements impose significant costs of compliance that are likely to increase over time any such violation could result in substantial fines sanctions or civil penalties damage to our reputation and might materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our business is subject to foreign currency exchange rates fluctuations 

we conduct approximately 51 of our business in various locations outside the united states we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency transaction exchange rates particularly with respect to the euro swedish krona polish zloty canadian dollar british pound and australian dollar change in the value of currencies of the countries in which we do business relative to the value of the us dollar or euro could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations additionally we are subject to foreign exchange translation risk due to changes in the value of foreign currencies in relation to our reporting currency the us dollar the translation risk is primarily concentrated in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro chinese yuan british pound canadian dollar swedish krona and australian dollar as the us dollar fluctuates against other currencies in which we transact business revenue and income can be impacted for instance our 2019 revenue decreased by 24 due to unfavorable foreign currency impacts strengthening of the us dollar relative to the euro and the currencies of the other countries in which we do business could materially and adversely affect our sales growth in future periods refer to item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information on foreign exchange risk 

failure to retain our existing senior management engineering technology sales and other key personnel or the inability to attract and retain new qualified personnel could negatively impact our ability to operate or grow our business 

our success will continue to depend to a significant extent on our ability to retain or attract employees in senior management engineering technology sales project management and other key personnel the ability to attract or retain employees will depend on our ability to offer attractive compensation benefits training and development opportunities and build an inclusive and diverse culture in an increasingly competitive environment for talent particularly in the fields of technology innovation and data science we will need to continue to develop qualified talent to support business growth and succession planning and to replace departing employees all of which are important to our longterm success a failure in effective succession planning transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution a failure to retain or attract highlyskilled personnel could adversely affect our reputation ability to meet the needs of our customers operating results or ability to operate or grow our business 

product defects unanticipated use or inadequate disclosures with respect to our products could adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements 

defects or inadequacies in manufacturing design software security or service of our products including such defects in products or components that we source from third parties unanticipated use of or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of our products could create product safety product security regulatory or environmental risks including personal injury death property or environmental damage these events could lead to recalls safety or security alerts relating to our products result in the removal of a product from the market and result in liability claims being brought against us although we have liability insurance we cannot be certain that this insurance coverage will continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost or will be adequate to cover any liability claims manufacturing design software security or service defects or inadequacies may also result in contractual damages or credits being issued which could impact our profitability recalls removals and liability and quality claims can result in significant costs as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our financial results can be difficult to predict 

our business is impacted by a substantial amount of short cycle and bookandbill business which we have limited insight into particularly for the business that we transact through our distributors we are also impacted by large projects whose timing can change based upon customer requirements due to a number of factors affecting the project beyond our knowledge or control such as funding readiness of the project and regulatory approvals accordingly our financial results for any given period can be difficult to predict 

changes in our effective tax rates and tax expenses may adversely affect our financial results 

we sell our products in approximately 150 countries and 51 of our revenue was generated outside the united states in 2019  given the global nature of our business a number of factors may increase our effective tax rates and tax expense including 



 xylem is regularly examined by various tax authorities throughout the world and the resolutions of these examinations do not typically have a significant impact on our effective tax rates and tax expenses but they could additionally in december 2017 the united states enacted tax reform legislation “tax act” the legislation implements many new us domestic and international tax provisions many aspects of the tax act have been clarified through regulations however several aspects remain unclear and additional clarifying guidance is expected to be issued by the internal revenue service “irs” the us treasury department or via a technical correction law change although it may not be clarified for some time in addition many us states have not yet updated their laws to take into account the new federal legislation as a result there may be further impacts of the new law on our results of operations and financial condition it is possible that the tax act or interpretations under it could change and could have an adverse effect on us and such effect could be material 

our indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operational flexibility 

as of december 31 2019  our total outstanding indebtedness was 2316 million as described under “liquidity and capital resources our indebtedness could 

 in addition there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available to us on favorable terms or at all for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness if we incur additional debt or raise equity through the issuance of preferred stock the terms of the debt or preferred stock issued may give the holders rights preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock particularly in the event of liquidation the terms of the debt may also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on our operations than we currently have 

our ability to make scheduled principal payments of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance which may be affected by factors beyond our control if we are unable to service our indebtedness our business financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 

we face risks related to legal and regulatory proceedings 

we are subject to various laws ordinances regulations and other requirements of government authorities in foreign countries and in the united states any violation of which could potentially create substantial liability for us and damage our reputation changes in laws ordinances regulations or other government policies the nature timing and effect of which are uncertain may significantly increase our expenses and liabilities 

from time to time we are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings that are incidental to the operation of our businesses or the business operations of previously owned entities these proceedings may seek remedies relating to environmental matters tax intellectual property acquisitions or divestitures product liability and personal injury claims privacy employment labor and pension matters government contract issues and commercial or contractual disputes our continuing transition to connected or digital technologies and solutions has increased our exposure to intellectual property litigation and we expect that this risk will continue to increase as we execute on our innovation and technology priorities 

it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of claims investigations regulatory proceedings and lawsuits and we could in the future incur judgments fines or penalties or enter into settlements and claims that could have an adverse effect on our reputation as well as an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in any particular period additionally we may be required to change or cease operations at one or more 

facilities if a regulatory agency determines that we have failed to comply with laws regulations or orders applicable to our business 

the global and diverse nature of our operations coupled with the increase in regulation and enforcement in many regions of the globe means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal and regulatory proceedings and other contingencies the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty will arise from time to time in addition subsequent developments in legal and regulatory proceedings may affect our assessments and estimates of loss contingencies recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments in excess of our reserves which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

weather conditions and climate changes may adversely affect or cause volatility in our financial results 

the unpredictable nature of weather conditions including heavy flooding droughts and fluctuations in temperatures or weather patterns including as a result of climate change can positively or negatively impact portions of our business and may result in volatility for certain portions of our business as well as the operations of certain of our customers and suppliers for example heavy rain events due to climate change may increase demand for some of our xylemvue solutions that may help customers minimize water and storm water overflows within the dewatering space pumps provided through our godwin and flygt brands are used to remove excess or unwanted water heavy flooding due to weather conditions drives increased demand for these applications on the other hand drought conditions drive higher demand for pumps used in agricultural and turf irrigation applications such as those provided by our goulds water technology and lowara brands fluctuations in temperatures result in varying levels of demand for products used in residential and commercial hydronic applications where homes and buildings are heated and cooled with hvac units such as those provided by our bell  gossett brand 

if we do not or cannot adequately protect our intellectual property if third parties infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property rights or if third parties claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights we may suffer competitive injury expend significant resources enforcing our rights or defending against such claims or be prevented from selling products or services 

we own numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others which in the aggregate are important to our business our intellectual property rights may provide us with competitive advantage because they may help us differentiate our technologies products and services including our growing portfolio of data analytics and digitallyenabled offerings the intellectual property rights that we have or obtain however may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage because they may not be sufficiently broad or may be challenged invalidated circumvented misappropriated independently developed or designedaround particularly given our international operations in countries where laws governing intellectual property rights are not highly developed protected or enforced our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention misappropriation or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we receive notices from third parties alleging intellectual property infringement or misappropriation any dispute or litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation in addition as a result of such claims of infringement or misappropriation we could lose our rights to critical technology be unable to license critical technology or sell critical products and services be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights or be required to redesign our products at substantial cost any of which could adversely impact our competitive position financial condition and results of operations even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation we may incur significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

a significant portion of our products and offerings in our measurement  control solutions segment are affected by the availability and regulation of radio spectrum and could be affected by interference with the radio spectrum that we use 

a significant portion of the offerings in our measurement  control solutions segment use radio spectrum which is subject to government regulation to the extent we introduce new products designed for use in the united states or another country into a new market such products may require significant modification or redesign in order to meet frequency requirements and other regulatory specifications in some countries limitations on frequency availability or the cost of making necessary modifications may preclude us from selling our products in those countries the 

regulations that govern our use of the radio spectrum may change and the changes may require us to modify our products or seek new partnerships either directly or due to interference caused by new consumer products allowed under the regulations the inability to modify our products to meet such requirements the possible delays in completing such modifications and the cost of such modifications all could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition suitable partners for codevelopment may not be able to be secured by us 

in the united states our products are primarily designed to use licensed spectrum in the 900mhz range if the fcc does not renew our existing spectrum licenses our business could be adversely affected in addition there may be insufficient available frequencies in some markets to sustain or develop our planned operations at a commercially feasible price or at all 

outside of the united states certain of our products require the use of radio frequency and are subject to regulations in some jurisdictions radio station licenses may be granted for a fixed term and must be periodically renewed our advanced and smart metering systems offering transmits to and receives information from if applicable handheld mobile or fixed network reading devices in licensed bands made available to us through strategic partnerships and are reliant to some extent on the licensed spectrum continuing to be available through our partners or our customers we may be unable to find partners or customers that have access to sufficient frequencies in some markets to sustain or develop our planned operations or to find partners or customers that have access to sufficient frequencies in the relevant markets at a commercially feasible price or at all 

we may incur impairment charges for our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets which would negatively impact our operating results 

we have a significant amount of goodwill and purchased intangible assets on our balance sheet as a result of acquisitions we have completed as of december 31 2019  the net carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets totaled approximately  3 billion  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we evaluate these assets for impairment at least annually or more frequently if interim indicators suggest that a potential impairment could exist significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets failure of the fcc to renew licenses divestitures and market capitalization declines may impair our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets any material charges relating to such impairments could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we cannot make assurances that we will pay dividends on our common stock or continue to repurchase our common stock under board approved share repurchase plans and likewise our indebtedness could limit our ability to pay dividends or make share repurchases 

the timing declaration amount and payment of future dividends to our shareholders fall within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on many factors including our financial condition cash flows results of operations and capital requirements as well as applicable law regulatory constraints industry practice and other business considerations that our board of directors considers relevant there can be no assurance that we will pay a dividend in the future or continue to pay dividends 

further the timing and amount of the repurchase of our common stock under board approved share repurchase plans has similar dependencies as the payment of dividends and accordingly there can be no assurances that we will repurchase our common stock 

additionally if we cannot generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet our debt payment obligations then our ability to pay dividends if so determined by the board of directors or make share repurchases will be impaired and we may be required to attempt to restructure or refinance our debt raise additional capital or take other actions such as selling assets reducing or delaying capital expenditures reducing our dividend or delaying or curtailing share repurchases there can be no assurance however that any such actions could be effected on satisfactory terms if at all or would be permitted by the terms of our debt or our other credit and contractual arrangements 

developments in environmental laws and regulations could impact our financial condition or results of operations 

our operations product and service offerings are subject to and affected by many federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations including those enacted in response to climate change concerns in addition we could be affected by future environmental laws or regulations compliance with current and future environmental laws and regulations currently requires and is expected to continue to require operating and capital expenditures 

environmental laws and regulations may authorize substantial fines and criminal sanctions as well as facility shutdowns to address violations and may require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit emissions or discharges we also incur and expect to continue to incur costs to comply with current environmental laws and regulations 

developments such as the adoption of new environmental laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations violations by us of such laws and regulations discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination litigation involving environmental impacts our inability to recover costs associated with any such developments or financial insolvency of other responsible parties could in the future have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

the level of returns on postretirement benefit plan assets changes in interest rates and other factors could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods 

certain members of our current and retired employee population are covered by pension and other employeerelated defined benefit plans collectively postretirement benefit plans we may experience significant fluctuations in costs related to our postretirement benefit plans as a result of macroeconomic factors such as interest rates that are beyond our control the cost of our postretirement plans is incurred over long periods of time and involves factors and uncertainties during those periods which can be volatile and unpredictable including rates of return on postretirement benefit plan assets discount rates used to calculate liabilities and expenses and rates of future compensation increases management develops each assumption using relevant plan and company experience and expectations in conjunction with marketrelated data our liquidity financial position including shareholders’ equity and results of operations could be materially affected by significant changes in key economic indicators actuarial experience financial market volatility future legislation and other governmental regulatory actions 

we make contributions to fund our postretirement benefit plans when considered necessary or advantageous to do so the macroeconomic factors discussed above including the return on postretirement benefit plan assets and the minimum funding requirements established by local government funding or taxing authorities or established by other agreement may influence future funding requirements a significant decline in the fair value of our plan assets or other adverse changes to our overall pension and other employeerelated benefit plans could require us to make significant funding contributions and affect cash flows in future periods

executive summary 

xylem reported revenue of 5249 million for 2019  an increase of 42 million  or 08  from 5207 million reported in 2018  on a constant currency basis revenue increased by 166 million  or 32  primarily consisting of organic revenue growth of 188 million  or 36  driven by growth in all end markets and across all segments a net decrease in revenue related to acquisition and divestiture impacts of 22 million partially offset the organic revenue growth during the year 

operating income for 2019 was 486 million  reflecting a decrease of 168 million  or 257  compared to 654 million in 2018  operating margin was 93 for 2019 versus 126 for 2018  a decrease of 330 basis points operating margin was negatively impacted by increased special charges of 147 million consisting entirely of noncash impairment charges and increased restructuring and realignment costs of 34 million during the year excluding the impact of these items adjusted operating income was 727 million  with an adjusted operating margin of 139 in 2019 as compared to adjusted operating income of 714 million with an adjusted operating margin of 137 in 2018  the slight increase in adjusted operating margin was primarily due to cost reductions from our global procurement and productivity initiatives including restructuring savings improved price realization and favorable volume impacts these impacts were partially offset by cost inflation unfavorable mix increased spending on strategic investments and increased cost of quality 

additional financial highlights for 2019 include the following 

 2020 business outlook 

we anticipate total revenue growth of approximately 1 in 2020  with organic revenue growth anticipated to be in the range of 1 to 3 the following is a summary of our 2019 organic revenue performance and 2020 organic revenue outlook by end market

results of operations

2019 versus 2018 

revenue 

revenue generated for 2019 was 5249 million  an increase of 42 million  or 08  compared to 5207 million in 2018  on a constant currency basis revenue grew 32 during 2019  this increase in revenue at constant currency was primarily driven by an increase in organic revenue of 188 million reflecting strong organic growth in the united states and the emerging markets with the exception of latin america partially offset by declines in canada and western europe a net decrease in revenue related to acquisition and divestiture impacts of 22 million partially offset organic growth during the year 

the following table illustrates the impact from organic growth recent acquisitions and divestitures and foreign currency translation in relation to revenue during 2019  





water infrastructure 

water infrastructure revenue slightly increased 1 million to 2177 million in 2019  33 increase on a constant currency basis compared to 2018  revenue was negatively impacted by 70 million of foreign currency translation with the change at constant currency coming entirely from organic growth during the year of 71 million  organic growth for the year was driven by strength in the utility end market particularly in the united states where we benefited from healthy order intake and strong market conditions across both applications the utility end market also saw growth in asia pacific and western europe driven by strong project deployments during the year the industrial end market has remained relatively flat during the year with organic growth in the emerging markets and the united states where we benefited from solid order intake and a strong mining market over the first half of the year which was partially offset by declines in western europe due to the timing of project deployments in the prior year organic growth in both end markets also benefited from price realization during the year 

from an application perspective organic revenue growth for the year was primarily driven by our transport application the transport application had strong organic revenue growth driven by project deliveries and price realization in the united states and the emerging markets organic growth from the global dewatering application was also up modestly for the year with strong growth in first half of the year coming from strength in construction and mining in the united states and australia being offset by rental revenue declines in north america in the second half of the year driven by a sharp drop off in oil and gas organic revenue from our treatment application also contributed to the segments growth driven by project deliveries in the united states and asia pacific where we benefited from strong order intake coming into the year this organic growth was partially offset by declines in the middle east and latin america primarily due to the lapping of large treatment project deliveries in these regions in the prior year 

applied water 

applied water revenue increased 7 million  or 05  in 2019 23 increase on a constant currency basis compared to 2018 revenue was negatively impacted by 29 million of foreign currency translation with the change at constant currency coming entirely from organic growth during the year of 36 million  organic growth for the year was primarily driven by strength in the commercial end market as well as prudent growth in the industrial and residential end markets 

from an application perspective organic revenue growth during the year was led by strength in the building services application in the commercial market which was driven by market expansion in the emerging markets primarily in the middle east  africa and product localization in china partially offset by softness in western europe the industrial water application had modest organic growth during the year primarily driven by market growth in western europe coupled with customers stocking orders due to geopolitical concerns and strength in the united states partially offset by some declines in the emerging market regions organic growth in building services application in the residential market came primarily from healthy market growth in the united states and strong second water supply business in china which was partially offset by declines in western europe and the middle east organic growth within the segment also benefited from price realization during the year 

measurement  control solutions 

measurement  control solutions revenue increased 34 million  or 23  in 2019  39 increase on a constant currency basis compared to 2018 revenue was negatively impacted by 25 million of foreign currency translation during the year revenue growth at constant currency was made up of organic revenue growth of 81 million  or 54  which was partially offset by 22 million of reduced revenue related to the net acquisition and divestiture impacts during the year organic revenue growth for the year was driven by strength in the utility end market primarily in the united states and the middle east partially offset by declines in the united kingdom 

from an application perspective organic revenue from the water metrology application contributed the majority of the organic growth for the segment with large project deployments in the united states the middle east and western europe during the year the energy application also contributed to the organic growth during the year as gas project deployments more than offset the timing of a large electric project deployment in the prior year in the united states  this organic growth was partially offset by a decline in the software as a service saas and other application primarily due to the timing of a large software sale in the prior year in the united kingdom the test application remained relatively flat as compared to the prior year 

ordersbacklog 

an order represents a legally enforceable written document that includes the scope of work or services to be performed or equipment to be supplied to a customer the corresponding price and the expected delivery date for the applicable products or services to be provided an order often takes the form of a customer purchase order “po” or a signed quote from a xylem business orders received during 2019 decreased by 98 million  or 18  to  5339 million  06 increase on a constant currency basis order intake during the year was negatively impacted by 129 million of foreign currency translation the order growth on a constant currency basis primarily consisted of organic order growth of 48 million  or 09  over the prior year net acquisition and divestiture activity of 17 million negatively impacted order growth during the year 

the following table illustrates the impact from organic growth recent acquisitions and divestitures and foreign currency translation in relation to orders during 2019  



 water infrastructure 

water infrastructure segment orders decreased 21 million  or 09  to 2234 million  24 increase on a constant currency basis order intake during the year was negatively impacted by 74 million of foreign currency translation the order increase on a constant currency basis was driven by organic order growth in the transport application transport organic order growth was primarily driven by a large smart city project order secured in india during the second half of the year and strong market conditions coupled with some price realization in europe china and north america organic orders for the treatment application declined during the year primarily driven by project timing in north america and india due to the timing of large project orders in the prior year partially offset by strong order intake in the middle east during the year 

applied water 

applied water segment orders slightly decreased 1 million to 1556 million  18 increase on a constant currency basis order intake during the year was negatively impacted by 29 million of foreign currency translation the order increase on a constant currency basis was driven by strong organic order growth in the united states and china across both applications which were partially offset by a reduction of orders in the middle east 

measurement  control solutions 

measurement  control solutions segment orders decreased  76 million  or 47  to 1549 million  31 decrease on a constant currency basis order intake during the year was negatively impacted by 26 million of foreign currency translation the order decrease on a constant currency basis was driven by an organic decline of 33 million  or 20  which followed a difficult comparison to the prior year organic order growth of 18 and 17 million of the net acquisition and divestiture impacts on the year the decrease in organic orders during the year was driven by the energy application decline in north america which had a significant electric deployment order in the prior year that did not repeat water application orders grew organically during the year driven by strong order intake within the aia platform partially offset by the lapping of large prior year orders for metrology projects coupled with some softening market conditions in north america and the middle east saas and other experienced modest organic growth during the year driven by order strength in north america largely offset by the lapping of a 

large uk software order in the prior year organic orders for the test application declined during the quarter driven by project timing and soft market conditions in europe 

backlog 

backlog includes orders on hand as well as contractual customer agreements at the end of the period delivery schedules vary from customer to customer based on their requirements annual or multiyear contracts are subject to rescheduling and cancellation by customers due to the longterm nature of the contracts as such beginning total backlog plus orders minus revenues will not equal ending total backlog due to contract adjustments foreign currency fluctuations and other factors typically large projects require longer lead production cycles and deployment schedules and delays can occur from time to time total backlog was 1801 million at december 31 2019 and 1689 million at december 31 2018  an increase of 66  we anticipate that approximately 60 of our total backlog at december 31 2019 will be recognized as revenue during 2020  this is down from prior years due to the changing profile of our backlog which includes a greater portion of large multiyear projects 

gross margin 

gross margin as a percentage of consolidated revenue increased 10 basis points to 390 in 2019 as compared to 389 in 2018  the slight gross margin increase was primarily driven by cost reductions from global procurement and productivity improvement initiatives and price realization which were partially offset by cost inflation and unfavorable mix 

operating expenses 

selling general and administrative sga expenses 

sga expenses decreased by 3 million decrease of 03  to 221 of revenue in 2019  as compared to 223 of revenue in 2018  the improvement in sga as a percent of revenue for the year was primarily driven by cost reductions from global procurement and productivity improvement initiatives including restructuring savings which were partially offset by cost inflation and additional investment in strategic growth initiatives 

research and development rd expenses 

rd expense was 191 million  or 36 of revenue in 2019 as compared to 189 million  or 36 of revenue in 2018  additionally we capitalized rd on external sale software of 59 million in 2019 as compared to 60 million in 2018  our increased spending on rd is driven by development needs to drive new product growth 

restructuring and asset impairment charges 

restructuring 

during 2019  we incurred restructuring costs of  20 million   5 million and 28 million in our water infrastructure applied water and measurement  control solutions segments respectively we incurred these charges related to actions taken in 2019 primarily as a continuation of our efforts to reposition our european and north american businesses to optimize our cost structure and improve our operational efficiency and effectiveness the charges included the reduction of headcount and consolidation of facilities within our measurement  control solutions and water infrastructure segments as well as headcount reductions within our applied water segment 

during 2018  we recognized restructuring costs of 9 million 2 million and 9 million in our water infrastructure applied water and measurement  control solutions respectively these charges were incurred primarily in an effort to reposition our european and north american businesses to optimize our cost structure and improve our operational efficiency and effectiveness the charges included the reduction of headcount and consolidation of facilities within our measurement  control solutions and water infrastructure segments as well as headcount reductions within our applied water segment 

the following is a rollforward of employee position eliminations associated with restructuring activities for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  

the following table presents expected restructuring spend 



the water infrastructure applied water and measurement  control solutions actions commenced in 2019 consist primarily of severance charges the applied water actions are complete the water infrastructure actions are expected to continue through q1 2020 and the measurement  control solutions actions are expected to continue through the fourth quarter of 2020 the water infrastructure applied water and measurement  control solutions actions commenced in 2018 consist primarily of severance charges and are complete the water infrastructure applied water measurement  control solutions and corporate actions commenced in 2017 consist primarily of severance charges and are expected to continue through 2021 as a result of the actions initiated in 2019 we achieved savings of approximately 15 million in 2019 and estimate annual future net savings beginning in 2020 of approximately 39 million resulting in 24 million of incremental savings from the 2019 actions 

asset impairment 

during the first and third quarter of 2019 we determined that certain assets within our measurement  control solutions segment including customer relationships internally developed software proprietary technology and plant property  equipment were impaired accordingly we recognized an impairment charge of 10 million during the year refer to note 12 goodwill and other intangible assets for additional information 

during the fourth quarter of 2018 we determined that certain software assets within our water infrastructure segment were impaired accordingly we recognized an impairment charge of 2 million 

goodwill impairment charge 

during the third quarter of 2019 the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 148 million related to the advanced infrastructure analytics “aia” goodwill reporting unit the impairment resulted from a downward revision of forecasted future cash flows factors that contributed to the revised forecast in the third quarter include lower 

than expected results as compared to prior forecasts largely as a result of slowerthanexpected conversion of pipeline opportunities to revenue additionally we have continued to invest in the aia platform ahead of the adoption curve which has also impacted the nearterm profitability of the business these factors drove a decrease in the fair value based on a discounted cash flow valuation of the aia reporting unit that was below its carrying value as of july 1 2019 requiring an impairment charge refer to note 12 goodwill and other intangible assets for additional information 

operating income 

operating income was 486 million operating margin of 93  during 2019  a decrease of 168 million  or 257  when compared to operating income of  654 million operating margin of 126  during the prior year operating margin for the year was negatively impacted by increased special charges of 147 million consisting entirely of noncash impairment charges and increased restructuring and realignment costs of 34 million as compared to the prior year excluding these special charges and restructuring and realignment costs adjusted operating income was 727 million adjusted operating margin of 139  for 2019 as compared to adjusted operating income of 714 million adjusted operating margin of 137  during the prior year the slight increase in adjusted operating margin was primarily due to cost reductions from our global procurement and productivity initiatives including restructuring savings improved price realization and favorable volume impacts these impacts were partially offset by cost inflation unfavorable mix increased spending on strategic investments and increased cost of quality 

the table below provides a reconciliation of total and each segments operating income to adjusted operating income and a calculation of the corresponding adjusted operating margin 

nm not meaningful 

water infrastructure 

operating income for our water infrastructure segment increased 6 million  or 17  during 2019 as compared to the prior year with operating margin also increasing from 165 to 168  operating margin was negatively impacted yearoveryear by increased restructuring and realignment costs of 11 million and positively impacted by special charges of 2 million incurred in 2018 that did not recur in 2019 excluding these items adjusted operating income increased 15 million  or 39  with adjusted operating margin increasing from 175 to 182  the increase in adjusted operating margin was primarily due to cost reductions from our global procurement and productivity initiatives price realization and favorable volume which were partially offset by cost inflation unfavorable mix increased cost of quality and increased spending on strategic investments 

applied water 

operating income for our applied water segment increased 5 million  or 21  during 2019 as compared to the prior year with operating margin also increasing from 154 to 156  operating margin was negatively impacted by increased restructuring and realignment costs of 3 million in 2019 excluding these restructuring and realignment costs adjusted operating income increased 8 million  or 33  with adjusted operating margin increasing from 160 to 165  the increase in adjusted operating margin was primarily due to cost reductions from our global procurement and productivity initiatives and price realization which were partially offset by cost inflation including tariffs increased cost of quality unfavorable mix unfavorable volume and increased spending on strategic investments 

measurement  control solutions 

operating income for our measurement  control solutions segment decreased 185 million  or 1568  during 2019 as compared to the prior year with operating margin also decreasing from 79 to 44  operating margin was negatively impacted by increased special charges of 154 million consisting entirely of noncash impairment charges and increased restructuring and realignment costs of 20 million during the year excluding these items adjusted operating income decreased 11 million  or 78  with adjusted operating margin decreasing from 94 to 85  the decrease in adjusted operating margin was primarily due to cost inflation increased spending on strategic investments and unfavorable mix impacts purchase accounting impacts from acquisitions also negatively affected operating margin these impacts were partially offset by cost reductions from our global procurement and productivity initiatives favorable volume impacts and price realization 

corporate and other 

operating loss for corporate and other decreased 6 million  or 102  compared to the prior year primarily due to 5 million of special charges incurred during 2018 that did not recur excluding these costs adjusted operating expense decreased 1 million  or 19  compared to the prior year 

interest expense 

interest expense was 67 million and 82 million for 2019 and 2018  respectively the decrease in interest expense for the year is primarily driven by the impact of cross currency swaps during the year and to a lesser extent additional interest expense that was incurred during 2018 related to debt to fund our acquisition of pure technologies ltd which was repaid during 2019 see note 13 derivative financial instruments of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our cross currency swaps see note 15 credit facilities and debt of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our credit facilities and longterm debt and related interest 

income tax expense 

the income tax provision for 2019 was 15 million at an effective tax rate of 37 as compared to 36 million at an effective tax rate of 61 in 2018  the 2019 effective tax rate differs from that of 2018 primarily due to the income tax benefit that resulted from changes in tax law in switzerland partially offset by the tax impact of the goodwill impairment charge on income before taxes in 2019 

other comprehensive loss income 

other comprehensive loss was 38 million in 2019 as compared to a loss of 111 million in 2018  foreign currency translation contributed favorable impacts during the year of 113 million driven the strengthening of the british pound the canadian dollar and the south african rand as compared to the us dollar in 2019 versus the weakening of these currencies in the prior year additionally the weakening of the euro chinese yuan and the australian dollar as compared to the us dollar was less negative in 2019 than the weakening of these currencies in the prior year these favorable currency translation impacts were partially offset by the movement in our euro net investment hedges during the quarter the tax impact on the foreign currency translation related to the euro net investment hedges also contributed to the net favorable foreign currency translation movement during the year partially offsetting these favorable drivers was the increased loss in postretirement benefit plans during the year primarily actuarial losses

during 2019  net cash provided by operating activities was 839 million  compared to 586 million in 2018  the 253 million yearoveryear increase was primarily driven by improvement in working capital levels due to the improved management of inventory and collection of receivables increase in cash from earnings and decreased payments for postretirement obligations during the period which were partially offset by an increase in cash tax payments 

investing activities 

cash used in investing activities was 231 million in 2019  compared to 643 million in 2018  this decrease in cash used of 412 million was mainly driven by the 433 million spent on 2018 acquisitions primarily the acquisition of pure technologies ltd versus the 18 million spent for acquisition activity during the current year and modestly lower spending on capital expenditures compared to the prior year this decrease is partially offset by 22 million of proceeds received for a divested business in 2018 

financing activities 

cash used by financing activities was 177 million in 2019  compared to 40 million in 2018  the increase in cash used during the year was primarily due to higher levels of shortterm debt related to acquisition financing in 2018 and an increase in dividends paid of 22 million during the period as compared to the prior year these drivers are partially offset by the higher net repayment of 120 million of longterm debt in the prior year and a decrease in share repurchase activity of 19 million as compared to the prior year 

funding and liquidity strategy 

our ability to fund our capital needs depends on our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access to bank financing and the capital markets historically we have generated operating cash flow sufficient to fund our primary cash needs centered on operating activities working capital capital expenditures strategic investments and dividends if our cash flows from operations are less than we expect we may need to incur debt or issue equity from time to time we may need to access the longterm and shortterm capital markets to obtain financing our access to and the availability of financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors including i our credit ratings or absence of a credit rating ii the liquidity of the overall capital 

markets and iii the current state of the economy there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or that such financing will be available at all 

we monitor our global funding requirements and seek to meet our liquidity needs on a cost effective basis based on our current global cash positions cash flows from operations and access to the commercial paper markets we believe there is sufficient liquidity to meet our funding requirements in addition our existing committed credit facilities and access to the public debt markets would provide further liquidity if required 

we anticipate that our present sources of funds including funds from operations and additional borrowings will provide us with sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet our liquidity and capital needs in both the united states and outside of the united states over the next twelve months 

credit facilities  longterm contractual commitments 

see note 15 credit facilities and debt of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our credit facilities and longterm debt 

nonus operations 

for 2019 and 2018  we generated 51 and 53 of our revenue from nonus operations respectively as we continue to grow our operations in the emerging markets and elsewhere outside of the united states we expect to continue to generate significant revenue from nonus operations and expect that a substantial portion of our cash will be predominately held by our foreign subsidiaries we expect to manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be acc essed we may transfer cash from certain international subsidiaries to the us and other international subsidi aries when we believe it is cost effective to do so we continually review our domestic and foreign cash profile expected future cash generation and investment opportunities and reassess whether there is a need to repatriate funds held internationally to support our us operations as of december 31 2019  we have provided a deferred tax liability of 9 million for net foreign withholding taxes and state income taxes on 505 million of earnings expected to be repatriated to the us parent in the future 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual commitments as of december 31 2019  

in addition to the amounts presented in the table above we have recorded liabilities for net investment hedges of 24 million and employee severance indemnities of 16 million these amounts have been excluded from the contractual obligations table due to an inability to reasonably estimate the timing or amounts of such payments in individual years further benefit payments which reflect expected future service related to the companys pension and other postretirement employee benefit obligations are presented in note 16  “postretirement benefit plans” of the consolidated financial statements and deferred income tax liabilities and uncertain tax positions are presented in note 7 income taxes of the consolidated financial statements and as such these obligations are not included in the above table finally estimated environmental payments and workers compensation and general liability reserves are excluded from the table above we estimate based on historical experience that we will spend approximately 2 million to 3 million per year on environmental investigation and remediation and approximately 5 million to 6 million per year on workers compensation and general liability at december 31 2019  we had estimated and accrued 3 million and 20 million related to environmental matters and workers compensation and general liability respectively 



 offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2019  we have issued guarantees for the debt and other obligations of consolidated subsidiaries in the normal course of business we have determined that none of these arrangements has a material current effect or is reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our consolidated financial statements financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

we obtain certain standby letters of credit bank guarantees and surety bonds from thirdparty financial institutions in the ordinary course of business when required under contracts or to satisfy insurance related requirements as of december 31 2019  the amount of surety bonds bank guarantees standby letters of credit and insurance letters of credit was 340 million  

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 

significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are discussed in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” of the consolidated financial statements accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they are inherently uncertain involve significant judgments include areas where different estimates reasonably could have been used and changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable however actual results in these areas could differ from management’s estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

revenue recognition xylem adopted the new guidance on recognizing revenue from contracts with customers as of january 1 2018 in accordance with this new guidance xylem recognizes revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of promised goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which it expects to be entitled to for providing those goods and services for each arrangement with a customer we identify the contract the associated performance obligations within the contract determine the transaction price of that contract allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation and recognize revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied 

the satisfaction of performance obligations in a contract is based upon when the customer obtains control over the asset depending on the nature of the performance obligation control transfers either at a particular point in time or over time which determines the recognition pattern of revenue 

for product sales other than longterm constructiontype contracts we recognize revenue once control has passed at a point in time which is generally when products are shipped in instances where contractual terms include a provision for customer acceptance revenue is recognized when either i we have previously demonstrated that the product meets the specified criteria based on either seller or customer specified objective criteria or ii upon formal acceptance received from the customer where the product has not been previously demonstrated to meet customer specified objective criteria we recognize revenue on product sales to channel partners including resellers distributors or valueadded solution providers at the point in time when the risks and rewards possession and title have transferred to the customer which usually occurs at the point of delivery 

revenue from performance obligations related to services is recognized over time as the performance obligations are satisfied in these instances the customer consumes the benefit of the service as xylem performs 

certain businesses also enter into longterm constructiontype sales contracts where revenue is recognized over time in these instances revenue is recognized using a measure of progress that applies an input method based on costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs we also recognize revenue for certain of these arrangements using the output method and measure progress based on shipments of product where control has transferred to the customer 

for all contracts with customers we determine the transaction price in the arrangement and allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation identified in the contract judgment is required to determine the appropriate unit of account and we separate out the performance obligations if they are capable of being distinct and if they are distinct within the context of the contract the transaction price is adjusted for our estimate of variable consideration which may include a right of return discounts rebates penalties and retainage to estimate variable consideration we apply the expected value or the most likely amount method based on whichever method most appropriately predicts the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to the method applied is typically based on historical experience and known trends we constrain the amounts of variable consideration that are included in the transaction price to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur or when uncertainties around the variable consideration are resolved 

the adoption of the new revenue guidance did not provide materially different results from historical revenue guidance 

income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities applying enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences will reverse based on the evaluation of available evidence we recognize future tax benefits such as net operating loss carryforwards to the extent that we believe it is more likely than not we will realize these benefits we periodically assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets and reflect any changes to our estimate of the amount we are more likely than not to realize in the valuation allowance with a corresponding adjustment to earnings or other comprehensive income as appropriate 

in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we look to the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences taxable income in carryback years and the feasibility of tax planning strategies and estimated future taxable income the valuation allowance can be affected by changes to tax laws changes to statutory tax rates and changes to future taxable income estimates 

due to the tax act we have recorded net foreign withholding taxes and state income taxes on earnings that are expected to be repatriated to the us parent we have not recorded any deferred taxes on the amounts that the company currently does not intend to repatriate as the determination of any deferred taxes on this amount is not practicable 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and to the extent to which additional taxes will be due furthermore we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities or upon completion of the litigation process based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 

we adjust our liability for uncertain tax positions in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional tax expense would result if a payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 

business combinations we record acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting all of the assets acquired liabilities assumed contractual contingencies and contingent consideration is recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill the application of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in order to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill these assumptions and estimates include a market participant’s use of the asset and the appropriate discount rates for a market participant our estimates are based on historical experience information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and when appropriate includes assistance from independent thirdparty appraisal firms significant assumptions and estimates include but are not limited to the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future the cost to buildrecreate certain technology the appropriate weightedaverage cost of capital and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset these estimates are inherently uncertain and 

unpredictable in addition unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates 

goodwill and intangible assets we review goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable we also review the carrying value of our finitelived intangible assets for potential impairment when impairment indicators arise we conduct our annual impairment test as of the first day of the fourth quarter for goodwill the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is not impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value then an impairment charge is recognized for that excess up to the amount of recorded goodwill we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using an income approach we estimate the fair value of our intangible assets with indefinite lives using either the income approach or the market approach under the income approach we calculate fair value based on the present value of estimated future cash flows under the market approach we calculate fair value based on recent sales and selling prices of similar assets 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinitelived intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions particularly related to future operating results and cash flows these estimates and assumptions include but are not limited to revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates assumed royalty rates future economic and market conditions and identification of appropriate market comparable data in addition the identification of reporting units and the allocation of assets and liabilities to the reporting units when determining the carrying value of each reporting unit also require judgment goodwill is tested for impairment at either the operating segment identified in note 22  “segment and geographic data” of the consolidated financial statements or one level below the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets is based on estimates and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable significant changes to these estimates and assumptions could adversely impact our conclusions actual future results may differ from those estimates 

in the third quarter of 2019 the company revised its forecasted future cash flows for the aia business factors that contributed to the revised forecast in the third quarter include lower than expected results as compared to prior forecasts largely as a result of slowerthanexpected conversion of pipeline opportunities to revenue additionally we have continued to invest in the aia platform ahead of the adoption curve which has also impacted the near term profitability of the business based on these factors we determined that there were indicators that the aia reporting unit’s goodwill may be impaired and accordingly we performed an interim goodwill impairment test as of july 1 2019 the results of the impairment test showed that the fair value of the aia reporting unit was lower than the carrying value resulting in a 148 million goodwill impairment charge as of december 31 2019 the remaining goodwill balance in our aia reporting unit after recording the goodwill impairment charge was 171 million 

also during the third quarter of 2019 due to the factors discussed above we assessed whether the carrying amounts of the aia reporting unit’s longlived assets may not be recoverable and therefore impaired our assessment resulted in an impairment charge of 7 million related to customer relationships proprietary technology software and property plant and equipment the charge was calculated using an income approach 

if we do not achieve our forecasts given that the fair value and the carrying value of the aia reporting unit were the same at july 1 2019 it is possible that the goodwill of the aia reporting unit could be deemed to be impaired in a future period 

during the fourth quarter of 2019  we performed our annual impairment assessment and determined that the estimated fair values of our goodwill reporting units were substantially in excess of each of their carrying values however future goodwill impairment tests could result in a charge to earnings we will continue to evaluate goodwill on an annual basis as of the beginning of our fourth quarter and whenever events and changes in circumstances require us to do so we determined that no impairment of the indefinitelived intangibles existed as of the measurement date in 2019  however future indefinitelived intangible impairment tests could result in a charge to earnings we will continue to evaluate indefinitelived intangibles on an annual basis as of the beginning of our fourth quarter and whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate there may be a potential impairment 

postretirement plans company employees around the world participate in numerous defined benefit plans the determination of projected benefit obligations and the recognition of expenses related to these plans are dependent on various assumptions these major assumptions primarily relate to discount rates expected longterm rates of return on plan assets rate of future compensation increases mortality health care inflation and years of service some of which are disclosed in note 16  “postretirement benefit plans” of the consolidated financial statements and other factors actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized on a straightline 

basis only to the extent they exceed 10 of the higher of the marketrelated value or projected benefit obligation over the average remaining service period of active plan participants or for plans with all or substantially all inactive participants over the average remaining life expectancy 

significant assumptions 

management develops each assumption using relevant company experience in conjunction with marketrelated data for each individual country in which such plans exist all assumptions are reviewed annually with thirdparty consultants and adjusted as necessary the table included below provides the weighted average assumptions used to estimate our defined benefit pension obligations and costs as of and for the years ended 2019 and 2018  



 we determine the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets by evaluating both historical returns and estimates of future returns specifically the company analyzes the estimated future returns based on independent estimates of asset class returns and evaluates historical broad market returns over longterm timeframes based on the strategic asset allocation which is detailed in note 16  “postretirement benefit plans” of the consolidated financial statements 

based on the approach described above the chart below shows weighted average actual returns versus the weighted average expected longterm rates of return for our pension plans that were utilized in the calculation of the net periodic pension cost for each respective year 

for the recognition of net periodic pension cost the calculation of the expected return on plan assets is generally derived by applying the expected longterm rate of return to the marketrelated value of plan assets the marketrelated value of plan assets is based on average asset values at the measurement date over the last five years the use of fair value rather than a calculated value could materially affect net periodic pension cost the weighted average expected longterm rate of return for all of our plan assets to be used in determining net periodic benefit costs for 2020 is estimated at 346  we estimate that every 25 basis point change in the expected return on plan assets impacts the expense by 1 million 

the discount rate reflects our expectation of the present value of expected future cash payments for benefits at the measurement date a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense we base the discount rate assumption on current investment yields of highquality fixed income investments during the retirement benefits maturity period the pension discount rate was determined by considering an interest rate yield curve comprising aaaaa bonds with maturities between zero and 30 years developed by the plan’s actuaries annual benefit payments are then discounted to present value using this yield curve to develop a singlepoint discount rate matching the plan’s characteristics our weighted average discount rate for all pension plans effective january 1 2020  is 197  we estimate that every 25 basis point change in the discount rate impacts the expense by 1 million 

the rate of future compensation increase assumption reflects our longterm actual experience and future and nearterm outlook effective january 1 2020  our expected rate of future compensation is 304 for all pension plans the estimated impact of a 25 basis point change in the expected rate of future compensation is less than 1 million 

the assumed rate of future increases in the per capita cost of health care the health care trend rate is 653 for 2020  decreasing ratably to 450 in 2028 an increase or decrease in the health care trend rates by one percent 

per year would impact the aggregate annual service and interest components by less than 1 million and impact the benefit obligation by approximately 3 million 

we currently anticipate making contributions to our pension and postretirement benefit plans in the range of 15 million to 25 million during 2020  of which 5 million is expected to be made in the first quarter 

funded status 

funded status is derived by subtracting the respective yearend values of the projected benefit obligations from the fair value of plan assets we estimate that every 25 basis point change in the discount rate impacts the funded status by approximately 33 million 

fair value of plan assets 

the plan assets of our pension plans comprise a broad range of investments including domestic and foreign equity securities interests in private equity and hedge funds fixed income investments insurance contracts and cash and cash equivalents 

a portion of our pension benefit plan assets portfolio comprises investments in private equity and hedge funds the private equity and hedge fund investments are generally measured at net asset value however in certain instances the values reported by the asset managers were not current at the measurement date accordingly we made estimate adjustments to the last reported value where necessary to measure the assets at fair value at the measurement date these adjustments consider information received from the asset managers as well as general market information the adjustment recorded at december 31 2019 and 2018 for these assets represented less than one percent of total plan assets in each respective year asset values for other positions were generally measured using market observable prices we estimate that a 5 change in asset values will impact funded status by approximately 28 million

 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates these exposures are actively monitored by management our exposure to foreign exchange rate risk is due to certain costs revenue and borrowings being denominated in currencies other than one of our subsidiaries functional currency similarly we are exposed to market risk as the result of changes in interest rates which may affect the cost of our financing it is our policy and practice to use derivative financial instruments only to the extent necessary to manage exposures 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we conduct approximately 51 of our business in various locations outside the united states 

our economic foreign currency risk primarily relates to receipts from customers payments to suppliers and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies we may use derivative financial instruments to offset risk related to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers when it is believed that the exposure will not be limited by our normal operating and financing activities we enter into currency forward contracts periodically in order to manage the exchange rate fluctuation risk on certain intercompany transactions associated with thirdparty sales and purchases these risks are also mitigated by natural hedges including the presence of manufacturing facilities outside the united states global sourcing and other spending which occurs in foreign countries our principal foreign currency transaction exposures primarily relate to the euro swedish krona polish zloty canadian dollar british pound and australian dollar we estimate that a hypothetical 10 movement in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material economic impact to xylem’s financial position and results of operations 

additionally we are subject to foreign exchange translation risk due to changes in the value of foreign currencies in relation to our reporting currency the us dollar the translation risk is primarily concentrated in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro chinese yuan british pound canadian dollar swedish krona and australian dollar as the us dollar strengthens against other currencies in which we transact business revenue and income will generally be negatively impacted and if the us dollar weakens revenue and income will generally be positively impacted we expect to continue to generate significant revenue from nonus operations and we expect our cash will be predominately held by our foreign subsidiaries we expect to manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed we may transfer cash from certain international subsidiaries to the us and other international subsidiaries when it is cost effective to do so though we continually review our domestic and foreign cash profile expected future cash generation and investment opportunities and reassess whether there is a need to repatriate funds held internationally to support our us operations we also hedge our investment in certain foreign subsidiaries via the use of cross currency swaps and the designation of our 225 senior notes of €500 million aggregate principal amount due march 2023 as a net investment hedge accordingly we estimate that a 10 movement of the us dollar to various foreign currency exchange rates we translate from in aggregate would not have a material economic impact on our financial position and results of operations 

effective july 1 2018 argentina was determined to be a highly inflationary economy and as such we evaluated the impact of revaluing our monetary assets and liabilities under the applicable guidance and do not expect it to have a material impact 

interest rate risk 

as of december 31 2019  our longterm debt portfolio is primarily comprised of four series of fixedrate senior notes that total 21 billion the senior notes are not exposed to interest rate risk as the bonds are at a fixed rate until maturity based on the current interest rate market we do not anticipate material risk associated with our debt refinancing within the target time frame of maturity

our industry 

our planet faces serious water challenges less than 1 of the total water available on earth is fresh water and these supplies are under threat due to factors such as the draining of aquifers increased pollution and the effects of climate change demand for fresh water is rising rapidly due to population growth industrial expansion and increased agricultural development with consumption estimated to double every 20 years by 2025 more than 30 of the world’s population is expected to live in areas without adequate water supply even in developed countries with sufficient clean water supply existing water supply infrastructure is aging and inadequately funded in the united states deteriorating pipe systems theft or inaccurate meters result in approximately one out of every six gallons of water being lost between the treatment plant and the end customer this problem of nonrevenue water is a major financial challenge of many utilities globally especially in developing markets where nonrevenue water can represent 15 to 60 or more of net water produced these and other challenges create opportunities for growth in the global water industry we estimate the total addressable market size to be approximately 550 billion  

we compete in areas that are pivotal to improving water productivity water quality and resilience water productivity refers to the more efficient delivery and use of clean water water quality refers to the efficient and effective management of wastewater resilience refers to the management of waterrelated risks and the resilience of water infrastructure our customers often face all three of these challenges ranging from inefficient and aging water distribution networks which require improvements in “water productivity” energyintensive or unreliable wastewater management systems which require improvements in “water quality” or exposure to natural disasters such as floods or droughts which require improvements in “resilience” additionally through the acquisition of sensus we also provide solutions to enhance communications and efficiency improve safety and conserve resources to customers in the water electric gas and lighting sectors delivering value in these areas creates significant opportunity for the company we estimate our total served market size to be approximately 57 billion 

the global water industry value chain 

the water industry value chain includes equipment and services companies like xylem which address the unique challenges and demands of a diverse customer base this customer base includes water and wastewater utilities that supply and treat clean water or transport and treat wastewater or storm water through an infrastructure network and engineering procurement and construction or epc firms which work with utilities to design and build water and wastewater infrastructure networks as depicted below utilities and epc customers require products solutions services technology and application expertise from their equipment and services providers to address trends such as rising pollution stricter regulations increasing operational costs and the increased outsourcing of process knowledge in addition to utilities and epc customers equipment and service providers also provide distinct technologies to a wide array of entities including farms mines power plants industrial facilities and residential and commercial customers seeking to address similar trends 

water industry supply chain 

business strategy 

our strategy is to enhance shareholder value by providing distinctive solutions for our customers most important water productivity quality and resilience challenges enabling us to grow revenue organically and through strategic acquisitions as we streamline our cost structure key elements of our strategy are summarized below 



business segments distribution and competitive landscape 

we have t hree reportable business segments that are aligned around the critical market applications they provide water infrastructure applied water and measurement  control solutions see note 21  “segment and geographic data” in our consolidated financial statements for financial information about segments and geographic areas 

the table and descriptions below provide an overview of our business segments 

water infrastructure 

our water infrastructure segment supports the process that collects water from a source treats it and distributes it to users and then treats and returns the wastewater responsibly to the environment through two closely linked applications transport and treatment  the transport application also includes sales and rental of specialty dewatering pumps and related equipment and services which provide the safe removal or draining of groundwater and surface water from riverbeds and construction sites or other industrial sites and bypass pumping for the repair of aging utility infrastructure as well as emergency water transport and removal during severe weather events 

the customer base consists of two primary end markets utility and industrial the utility market includes public private and publicprivate entities that support water wastewater and storm water networks the industrial market includes customers who require similar water and wastewater infrastructure networks to support various industrial operations 

water infrastructure provides the majority of its sales through direct channels with remaining sales through indirect channels and service capabilities both utility and industrial facility customers increasingly require our teams’ global but locally proficient expertise to use our equipment in their specific applications several trends are increasing demand for this application expertise i the increase in both the type and amount of contaminants 

found in the water supply ii increasing environmental regulations iii the need to increase system efficiencies to optimize energy and other operational costs iv the retirement of a largely aging water industry workforce that has not been systematically replaced at utilities and other enduser customers and v the buildout of water infrastructure in the emerging markets we estimate our served market size in this sector to be approximately 17 billion 

given the highly fragmented nature of the water industry the water infrastructure segment competes with a large number of businesses we differentiate ourselves in the market by focusing on product and service performance quality and reliability innovation speed to market with new or disruptive technologies application expertise brand reputation energy efficiency product lifecycle cost timeliness of delivery proximity of service centers effectiveness of our distribution channels and price in the sale or rental of products and provision of services we benefit from our large installed base which requires maintenance repair and replacement parts due to the critical application and nature of the products and the conditions under which they operate timeliness of delivery quality and the proximity of service centers are important customer considerations when selecting a provider for aftermarket products and services as well as equipment rentals in geographic regions where we are locally positioned to provide a quick response customers have historically relied on us rather than our competitors for aftermarket products relating to our highly engineered and customized solutions our key competitors within the water infrastructure segment include ksb inc sulzer ltd evoqua water technologies united rentals danaher corporation and grundfos 

applied water 

applied water encompasses the uses of water and serves a diverse set of end markets including residential commercial and industrial residential consumers represent the end users in the residential market while owners and managers of properties such as apartment buildings retail stores institutional buildings restaurants schools hospitals and hotels are examples of end users in the commercial market the industrial market includes oems exploration and production firms and developers and managers of industrial facilities such as electrical power generators chemical manufacturers machine shops clothing manufacturers beverage dispensing and food processing firms and car washes 

in the applied water segment end markets vary widely and as a result specialized distribution partners are often preferred as such the applied water segment provides the majority of its sales through strong indirect channels with the remaining sales going through our global direct sales channels we have longstanding relationships with many of the leading independent distributors in the markets we serve and we provide incentives to distributors such as specialized loyalty and training programs 

we estimate our served market size in this sector to be approximately 19 billion population growth urbanization and regulatory requirements are macro growth drivers of these markets driving the need for housing food community services and retail goods within growing city centers 

competition in the applied water segment focuses on brand equity application expertise product delivery and performance and energy efficiency quality and price we compete by offering a wide variety of innovative and highquality products coupled with worldclass application expertise we believe our distribution through wellestablished channels and our reputation for quality significantly enhance our market position our ability to deliver innovative product offerings has enabled us to compete effectively to cultivate and maintain customer relationships and to serve and expand into many niche and new markets our key competitors within the applied water segment include grundfos wilo se pentair plc and franklin electric co inc 

measurement  control solutions 

measurement  control solutions develops advanced technology solutions that enable intelligent use and conservation of critical water and energy resources the segment delivers communications smart metering measurement and control technologies and critical infrastructure technologies that allow customers to more effectively use their distribution networks for the delivery monitoring and control of critical resources such as water electricity and natural gas we also provide analytical instrumentation used to measure water quality flow and level in clean water wastewater surface water and coastal environments additionally we offer software and services including cloudbased analytics remote monitoring and data management leak detection condition assessment asset management and pressure monitoring solutions we also offer smart lighting solutions that improve efficiency and public safety efforts across communities 

at the heart of our leading technologies is automation data management and decision support communications networks automate and optimize meter reading monitor flow rates and detect and enable rapid response to 

changing and unsafe conditions in short they provide insight into operations and enable our customers to manage the entire scope of their operations remotely through their networks at the center of our offering is the flexnet communication network which provides a common communications platform and infrastructure for essential services this twoway communication technology remotely connects a wide variety of smart points in a given network with protocols frequently on fcc licensed spectrum in the us that enable reliable resilient and secure transmissions these technologies allow our customers to remotely and continuously monitor infrastructure prioritize and manage maintenance and use data to optimize all aspects of their networks our advanced infrastructure analytics complement these offerings with intelligent solutions that help utility decisionmakers manage their networks more effectively in real time 

the majority of our sales in the us is conducted through strong longstanding relationships with leading distributors and dedicated channel partners for water gas and electric markets internationally direct sales are often made in markets without established distribution channels however some distribution channels are used in more developed markets a more direct sales approach with key account management is employed for large utilities and government programs 

we estimate our served market size in this sector to be approximately 21 billion macro growth drivers include increasing regulation aging infrastructure and worldwide movement towards smart grid implementation water scarcity and conservation as well as the need to prevent revenue loss via inaccurate meter readings leaks or theft are among the drivers of smart meter and leak detection technologies 

our sensusbranded meters are well positioned in the smart metering sector the fastest growing sector of the global meter industry we set ourselves apart in the industry by focusing on our communication network innovation new product development and service offerings that deliver tangible savings of nonrevenue water through improved meter accuracy reduced theft and identification of leaks pure technologies’ equipment and services are also well positioned in the leak detection sector which is attracting considerable attention as aging infrastructure and increased regulatory scrutiny exert pressure on operating budgets our key competitors within the measurement  control solutions segment include itron badger meter landisgyr neptune roper elster honeywell mueller water products danaher corporation hach and teledyne 

geographic profile 

the table below illustrates the annual revenue and percentage of revenue by geographic area for each of the three years ended december 31 

in addition to the traditional markets of the united states and western europe opportunities in emerging markets within asia pacific eastern europe latin america and other countries are growing revenue derived from emerging markets comprised approximately 20 of our revenue in each of the last three years 

supply and seasonality 

we have a global manufacturing footprint with production facilities in europe north america latin america and asia our inventory management and distribution practices seek to minimize inventory holding periods by striving to take delivery of the inventory and manufacturing as close as possible to the sale or distribution of products to our customers all of our businesses require various parts and raw materials of which the availability and prices may fluctuate parts and raw materials commonly used in our products include motors fabricated parts castings bearings seals batteries pcbs and electronic components as well as steel brass nickel copper aluminum and plastics while we may recover some cost increases through operational improvements we are still exposed to some pricing risk including increased pricing risk due to duty and tariff assessments by the united states on foreign imports we attempt to control costs through fixedpriced contracts with suppliers and various other programs such as our global procurement initiative 

our business relies on thirdparty suppliers contract manufacturing and commodity markets to secure raw materials parts and components used in our products we typically acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our materials requirements for many of our products we have existing alternate sources of supply or such sources may be readily available 

we may experience price volatility or supply constraints for materials that are not available from multiple sources from time to time we acquire certain inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longerterm pricing commitments with suppliers to improve the priority price and availability of supply there have been no raw material shortages in the past several years that have had a significant adverse impact on our business as a whole 

our business segments experience a modest level of seasonality in their business this seasonality is dependent on factors such as capital spending of customers as well as weather conditions including heavy flooding droughts and fluctuations in temperatures all of which can positively or negatively impact portions of our business 

customers 

our business is not dependent on any single customer or a few customers the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our company no individual customer accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated 2018  2017 or 2016 revenue 

backlog 

backlog includes orders on hand as well as contractual customer agreements at the end of the period delivery schedules vary from customer to customer based on their requirements annual or multiyear contracts are subject to rescheduling and cancellation by customers due to the longterm nature of the contracts as such beginning total backlog plus orders minus revenues will not equal ending total backlog due to contract adjustments foreign currency fluctuations and other factors typically large projects require longer lead production cycles and deployment schedules and delays can occur from time to time total backlog was 1689 million at december 31 2018 and 1513 million at december 31 2017  we anticipate that approximately 65 of the backlog at december 31 2018 will be recognized as revenue during 2019  

research and development 

research and development “rd” is a key foundation of our growth strategy and we focus on the design and development of products and application knowhow that anticipate customer needs and emerging trends our engineers are involved in new product development as well as improvement of existing products to increase customer value our businesses invest substantial resources into rd we anticipate we will continue to develop and invest in our rd capabilities to promote a steady flow of innovative highquality and reliable products and integrated solutions to further strengthen our position in the markets we serve in addition to investments made in software development which were capitalized we incurred 189 million  181 million  and 110 million as a result of rd investment spending in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively 

we have rd and product development capabilities around the world rd activities are initially conducted in our technology centers located in conjunction with some of our major manufacturing facilities to ensure an efficient and robust development process we have several global technical centers and local development teams around the world where we are supporting global needs and accelerating the customization of our products and solutions to address local needs in some cases our rd activities are conducted at our piloting and testing facilities and at strategic customer sites these piloting and testing facilities enable us to serve our strategic markets globally as part of expanding our bandwidth and to increase our access to technology we have built innovation ecosystem partnerships with academic institutions startup accelerators and venture capitalist organizations 

capitalized software 

we capitalize software developed for sale to external customers which is included within other intangible assets net on our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2018 and 2017 we had net capitalized software for sale to external customers of 128 million and 89 million respectively 

intellectual property 

we generally seek patent protection for those inventions and improvements that we believe will improve our competitive position we believe that our patents and applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and improving our return on research and development investments while we own control or license a significant number of patents trade secrets proprietary information trademarks trade names 

copyrights and other intellectual property rights which in the aggregate are of material importance to our business management believes that our business as a whole as well as each of our core business segments is not materially dependent on any one intellectual property right or related group of such rights 

patents patent applications and license agreements expire or terminate over time by operation of law in accordance with their terms or otherwise as the portfolio of our patents patent applications and license agreements has evolved over time we do not expect the expiration of any specific patent to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

environmental matters and regulation 

our global operations are subject to various laws and regulations governing the environment including the discharge of pollutants and the management and disposal of hazardous substances while environmental laws and regulations are subject to change such changes can be difficult to predict reliably and the timing of potential changes is uncertain management does not believe based on current circumstances that compliance costs pursuant to such regulations will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations however the effect of future legislative or regulatory changes could be material to our financial condition or results of operations 

we continue to be dedicated to environmental and sustainability programs to minimize the use of natural resources and reduce the utilization and generation of hazardous materials from our processes and to remediate identified environmental concerns as to the latter we are currently engaged in site investigations and remediation activities to address environmental cleanup from past operations at current and former manufacturing facilities we do not anticipate these liabilities will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations at december 31 2018  we had estimated and accrued 4 million related to environmental matters 

environmental sustainability 

at xylem sustainability is at the very center of who we are and what we do as a leading global water technology company we address one of the world’s most urgent sustainability challenges on a daily basis  responsible stewardship of our shared water resources technology is playing an increasingly important role in helping the world solve water issues we have a long history of innovation but today we are focusing more than ever on the powerful capabilities of smart technology integrated management and big data these solutions will allow us to transport treat test and use water smarter and more sustainably than in the past and enable our customers to realize greater water and energy efficiencies our link to global water and environmental challenges informs how we think about sustainability and drives us to become a more sustainable company 

our approach to climaterelated issues is informed by xylem’s climate change policy which defines our climate change approach across product development operations employees and external engagement for example in the past two years we have completed several acquisitions to build out our measurement  control solutions portfolio around systems intelligence bringing bestinclass advanced metering infrastructure advanced data analytics and software development capabilities to our portfolio these technologies have enhanced our ability to help customers facing water scarcity storm water overflows and other climaterelated issues we are also focused on increasing our capabilities in the areas of advanced industrial water treatment and industrial water services we are committed to sustainability through our own operations as well as we are reducing our environmental footprint by decreasing our water intensity greenhouse gas emissions and waste sent to landfills 

employees 

as of december 31 2018  xylem had approximately 17000 employees worldwide we have approximately 5900 employees in the united states of whom approximately 16 are represented by labor unions in certain foreign countries our employees are represented by work councils we believe that our facilities are in favorable labor markets with ready access to adequate numbers of workers and believe our relations with our employees are good

 item 1a risk factors 

in evaluating our business each of the following risks should be carefully considered along with all of the other information in this report and in our other filings with the sec should any of these risks and uncertainties develop into actual events our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material but are not the only risks and uncertainties we face and therefore may not be exhaustive we operate in a continually changing business economic and geopolitical environment and as a result new risk factors may emerge from time to time we can neither predict with certainty these new risk factors nor assess the extent to which any new factor or combination of factors may adversely impact our business or results of operations 

risks related to operational and external factors 

failure to compete successfully in our markets and disruptive technologies could adversely affect our business 

we offer our products and services in competitive markets we believe the principal points of competition in our markets are product and service performance quality and reliability innovation speed to market with new or disruptive technologies application expertise brand reputation energy efficiency product life cycle cost timeliness of delivery proximity of service centers effectiveness of our distribution channels and price maintaining and improving our competitive position will require successful management of these factors including continued investment by us in manufacturing technology and innovation research and development engineering marketing customer service and support and our distribution networks our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors including our ability to i identify emerging technological trends in our target endmarkets ii develop and maintain competitive products services and business models and defend our market share against an everexpanding number of competitors including many new and nontraditional competitors iii enhance our products and services offerings by adding innovative features or disruptive technologies that differentiate them from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization iv develop manufacture and bring compelling new products and services to market quickly and costeffectively and v attract develop and retain individuals with the requisite technical expertise and understanding of customers’ needs to develop new technologies and introduce new products and services 

we may not be successful in maintaining our competitive position our competitors or third parties from outside of our industry may develop disruptive technologies or products and services that are superior to ours may develop more efficient or effective methods of providing products and services or may adapt more quickly than we do to new or disruptive technologies or evolving customer requirements the failure of our technologies products or services to maintain and gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings could significantly reduce our revenues or market share and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects pricing pressures also could cause us to adjust the prices of certain products to stay competitive which could adversely affect our market share and financial performance failure to continue competing successfully or to win large contracts could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by global economic and financial market conditions 

we compete around the world in various geographic and product markets in 2018  47  25 and 20 of our total revenue was from customers located in the united states western europe and emerging markets respectively we expect revenue from these markets to be significant for the foreseeable future important factors impacting our businesses include the overall strength of these economies and our customers’ confidence in both local and global macroeconomic conditions industrial and private sector spending federal state local and municipal governmental fiscal and trade policies the strength of the residential and commercial real estate markets interest rates availability of commercial financing for our customers and endusers the availability of funding for our public sector customers and unemployment rates a slowdown or prolonged downturn in our markets could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

economic and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our business 

in 2018  53 of our total revenue was from customers outside the united states with 20 of total revenue generated in emerging markets we expect our sales from international operations and export sales to continue to be a significant portion of our revenue we have placed a particular emphasis on increasing our growth and presence in emerging markets many of our manufacturing operations employees and suppliers are located 

outside of the united states both our international operations and sales are subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside the united states these risks include the following 

 changes in the geopolitical or economic environments in the countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows for example changes in us policy regarding international trade including import and export regulation and international trade agreements could also negatively impact our business in 2018 the us imposed tariffs on certain goods imported from china and certain other countries which has resulted in retaliatory tariffs by china and other countries additional tariffs imposed by the us on a broader range of imports or further retaliatory trade measures taken by china or other countries in response could result in an increase in supply chain costs that we may not be able to offset or may otherwise adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 

additionally we continue to monitor brexit and its potential impacts on our results of operations and financial condition volatility in foreign currencies is expected to continue as the united kingdom executes its exit from the european union if the united kingdoms membership in the european union terminates without an agreement referred to as a “hard brexit” there could be increased costs from reimposition of tariffs on trade between the united kingdom and european union increased transportation costs shipping delays because of the need for customs inspections and procedures and shortages of certain goods the united kingdom will also need to negotiate its own tax and trade treaties with countries all over the world which could take years to complete in the case of a “hard brexit” our exposure to disruptions to our supply chain increased costs the imposition of tariffs and currency devaluation in the united kingdom could result in a material impact to our consolidated revenue earnings and cash flow 

further any payment of distributions loans or advances to us by our foreign subsidiaries could be subject to restrictions on or taxation of dividends on repatriation of earnings under applicable local law monetary transfer restrictions and foreign currency exchange regulations in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate in addition to the general risks that we face outside the united states our operations in emerging markets could involve additional uncertainties for us including risks that governments may impose withholding or other taxes on remittances and other payments to us or the amount of any such taxes may increase governments may seek to nationalize our assets or governments may impose or increase investment barriers or other restrictions affecting our business in addition emerging markets pose other uncertainties including the difficulty of enforcing agreements challenges collecting receivables protection of our intellectual property and other assets pressure on the pricing of our products and services higher business conduct risks ability to hire and retain qualified talent and risks of political instability we cannot predict the impact such events might have on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business could be adversely affected by cyber threats or other interruptions in information technology communications networks and operations 

our business operations rely on information technology and communications networks including those operated by third parties to process transmit and store our electronic information or our customers’ electronic information and manage or support a variety of business processes or activities regardless of protection measures essentially all systems are susceptible to disruption due to cybersecurity attacks including denialofservice computer viruses and security breaches insider risk equipment or system failure vandalism natural disasters power outages shutdown telecommunication or utility failure and other events in addition we have designed products and services that connect to and are part of the “internet of things” while we attempt to provide adequate security measures to safeguard our products from cyber threats the potential for an attack remains a successful attack may result in inappropriate access to our or our customers information or an inability for our products and services to function properly 

we and some of our third party vendors have experienced cybersecurity attacks in the past and may experience them in the future likely with more frequency and involving a broader range of devices to date none have resulted in any material adverse impact to our business or operations we have adopted measures designed to mitigate potential risks associated with information technology disruptions and cybersecurity threats however given the unpredictability of the timing nature and scope of such disruptions we could potentially be subject to production downtimes operational delays other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers the compromise of confidential or otherwise protected information destruction or corruption of data security breaches other manipulation or improper use of our systems or networks financial losses from remedial actions loss of business liability to others regulatory enforcement actions andor damage to our reputation we also have or operate through a concentration of operations on certain sites such as production and shared services centers where business interruptions could cause material damage and costs transport of goods from suppliers and to customers could also be hampered for the reasons stated above disruption to any of the information technology and communications networks on which we rely or an attack on our iot products and services could interfere with our operations disrupt service to our customers interrupt production and shipments damage customer relationships and negatively impact our reputation any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

although we continue to assess these risks implement controls and perform business continuity and disaster recovery planning we cannot be sure that interruptions with material adverse effects will not occur 

a material disruption to any of our facilities or operations or that of third parties upon which we rely may adversely affect our business 

if our facilities or operations or that of third parties upon which we rely in our supply chain and critical business operations were to be disrupted as a result of a significant equipment or system failure natural disaster power water or communications outage fire explosion critical supply failure terrorism cyberbased attack political disruption labor dispute work stoppage or slowdown adverse weather conditions or other reason our financial performance could be adversely affected interruptions could cause an inability to meet customer demand increase our costs reduce our sales and impact our business processes and activities we also have or operate through a concentration of operations on certain sites such as production and shared services centers where business interruptions could cause material damage and costs any interruption in capability may be lengthy and have lasting effects require a significant amount of management and other employees time and focus and require us to make substantial expenditures to remedy the situation which could negatively affect our profitability and financial condition any recovery under our insurance policies may not offset the lost sales or increased costs that may be experienced during the disruption of operations which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring and transformation plans and our restructuring may adversely affect our business 

in recent fiscal years we have initiated restructuring realignment and transformation plans in an effort to optimize our cost structure and improve our operational efficiency and effectiveness in 2017 we undertook steps to advance a multiyear effort to transform many of our support functions and related technologies including finance human resources and procurement we may not be able to obtain the cost savings and benefits that were initially anticipated in connection with our restructuring and transformation plans implementing planned restructuring 

activities could be delayed resulting in delayed realization of the operational and financial benefits from such actions additionally as a result of these plans we may experience a loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge or inefficiency during transitional periods transformation realignment and restructuring can require a significant amount of management and other employees time and focus which may divert attention from operating and growing our business 

the successful implementation and execution of our restructuring realignment and transformation actions are critical to achieving our expected cost savings as well as effectively competing in the marketplace and positioning us for future growth factors that may impede a successful implementation include the retention of key employees the impact of regulatory matters including tax matters involving certain third party service providers selected to assist us including their compliance with the companys internal controls over financial reporting and adverse economic market conditions if our restructuring actions are not executed successfully it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position business financial condition and results of operations 

our strategy includes acquisitions and we may not be able to execute acquisitions of suitable candidates or integrate acquisitions successfully 

as part of our growth strategy we plan to pursue the acquisition of other companies assets technologies and product lines that either complement or expand our existing business we may not be able to identify suitable candidates negotiate appropriate acquisition terms obtain financing that may be needed to consummate acquisitions complete proposed acquisitions successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or expand into new markets in addition we cannot make assurances that any acquisition once integrated will perform as planned be accretive to earnings or prove to be beneficial to our operations or cash flow 

acquisitions involve a number of risks and present financial managerial and operational challenges including diversion of management attention from existing businesses and operations integration of technology operations personnel and financial and other systems potentially insufficient cybersecurity controls or insufficient internal controls over financial or compliance activities or financial reporting at an acquired entity that could impact us on a combined basis the failure to realize expected synergies the possibility that we become exposed to substantial undisclosed liabilities or new material risks associated with the acquired businesses and the loss of key employees of the acquired businesses failure to successfully execute our acquisition strategy could adversely affect our competitive position business financial condition or results of operations 

failure to comply with laws regulations and policies including but not limited to the us foreign corrupt practices act or other applicable anticorruption legislation and data privacy and security laws could result in fines criminal penalties and an adverse effect on our business 

we are subject to regulation under a wide variety of us federal and state and nonus laws regulations and policies including laws related to anticorruption trade regulations including export and import compliance antitrust and money laundering due to our global operations the us foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa the uk bribery act of 2010 and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from improper conduct of our employees or business partners in the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees or business partners have or may have violated applicable laws regulations or policies including anticorruption laws we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management any such violation could result in substantial fines sanctions civil andor criminal penalties and curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions and might materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition in addition actual or alleged violations could damage our reputation and ability to do business 

additionally to conduct our operations we regularly move data across national borders and consequently we are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in the united states and abroad regarding privacy data protection and data security the scope of the laws that may be applicable to us is often uncertain and may be conflicting particularly with respect to foreign laws for example the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” which became effective in may 2018 greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of european union law and adds a broad array of requirements for handling personal data including the public disclosure of significant data breaches other countries such as china have enacted or are 

enacting data localization laws that require data to stay within their borders all of these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs of compliance that are likely to increase over time any such violation could result in substantial fines sanctions or civil penalties damage to our reputation and might materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our business could be adversely affected by significant movements in foreign currency exchange rates 

we conduct approximately 53 of our business in various locations outside the united states we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency transaction exchange rates particularly with respect to the euro swedish krona polish zloty canadian dollar british pound and australian dollar any significant change in the value of currencies of the countries in which we do business relative to the value of the us dollar or euro could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations additionally we are subject to foreign exchange translation risk due to changes in the value of foreign currencies in relation to our reporting currency the us dollar the translation risk is primarily concentrated in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro chinese yuan british pound canadian dollar swedish krona and australian dollar as the us dollar fluctuates against other currencies in which we transact business revenue and income can be impacted for instance our 2018 revenue increased by 05 due to favorable foreign currency impacts strengthening of the us dollar relative to the euro and the currencies of the other countries in which we do business could materially and adversely affect our sales growth in future periods refer to item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information on foreign exchange risk 

failure to retain our existing senior management engineering technology sales and other key personnel or the inability to attract and retain new qualified personnel could negatively impact our ability to operate or grow our business 

our success will continue to depend to a significant extent on our ability to retain or attract a significant number of employees in senior management engineering technology sales and other key personnel the ability to attract or retain employees will depend on our ability to offer competitive compensation benefits training and development and an attractive culture we will need to continue to develop a roster of qualified talent to support business growth and replace departing employees effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution a failure to retain or attract highly skilled personnel could adversely affect our operating results or ability to operate or grow our business 

product defects and unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure with respect to our products could adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements 

manufacturing or design defects in including in products or components that we source from third parties unanticipated use of or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of our products could create product safety regulatory or environmental risks including personal injury death or property damage these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products result in the removal of a product from the market and result in product liability claims being brought against us although we have liability insurance we cannot be certain that this insurance coverage will continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost or will be adequate to cover any product liability claims manufacturing design software or service defects or inadequacies may also result in contractual damages or credits being issued which could impact our profitability recalls removals and product liability and quality claims can result in significant costs as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our financial results can be difficult to predict 

our business is impacted by a substantial amount of short cycle and bookandbill business which we have limited insight into particularly for the business that we transact through our distributors we are also impacted by large projects whose timing can change based upon customer requirements due to a number of factors affecting the project beyond our knowledge or control such as funding readiness of the project and regulatory approvals accordingly our financial results for any given period can be difficult to predict 

changes in our effective tax rates and tax expenses may adversely affect our financial results 

we sell our products in approximately 150 countries and 53 of our revenue was generated outside the united states in 2018  given the global nature of our business a number of factors may increase our effective tax rates and tax expense including 

 xylem is regularly examined by various tax authorities throughout the world and the resolutions of these examinations do not typically have a significant impact on our effective tax rates and tax expenses but they could additionally in december 2017 the united states enacted tax reform legislation “tax act” the legislation implements many new us domestic and international tax provisions many aspects of the tax act remain unclear and although additional clarifying guidance is expected to be issued by the internal revenue service “irs” the us treasury department or via a technical correction law change it may not be clarified for some time in addition many us states have not yet updated their laws to take into account the new federal legislation as a result there may be further impacts of the new law on our results of operations and financial condition it is possible that the tax act or interpretations under it could change and could have an adverse effect on us and such effect could be material 

our business could be adversely affected by inflation tariffs and other manufacturing and operating cost increases 

our operating costs are subject to fluctuations particularly due to changes in prices for commodities parts raw materials energy and related utilities freight and cost of labor which may be driven by prevailing price levels exchange rates changes in trade protection measures including tariffs and other economic factors in order to remain competitive we may not be able to recuperate all or a portion of these higher costs from our customers through product price increases further in a declining price environment our operating margins may contract because we account for inventory using the firstin first out method actions we take to mitigate volatility in manufacturing and operating costs may not be successful and as a result our business financial condition and results of operation could be materially and adversely affected 

our business could be adversely affected by the availability of parts and raw materials or the inability of suppliers to meet delivery requirements 

our business relies on thirdparty suppliers contract manufacturing and commodity markets to secure raw materials parts and components used in our products and we expect that reliance to increase parts and raw materials commonly used in our products include motors fabricated parts castings bearings seals batteries pcbs and electronic components as well as steel brass nickel copper aluminum and plastics we are exposed to the availability of these materials which may be subject to curtailment or change due to among other things interruptions in production by suppliers labor disputes the impaired financial condition of a particular supplier suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers changes in trade protection measures including tariffs exchange rates and prevailing price levels ability to meet regulatory requirements weather emergencies or acts of war or terrorism any delay in our suppliers’ abilities to provide us with necessary materials could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers and accordingly could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operational flexibility 

as of december 31 2018  our total outstanding indebtedness was 2308 million as described under “liquidity and capital resources our indebtedness could 



indebtedness instead of funding working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or other general corporate purposes and 

 in addition there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available to us on favorable terms or at all for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness if we incur additional debt or raise equity through the issuance of preferred stock the terms of the debt or preferred stock issued may give the holders rights preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock particularly in the event of liquidation the terms of the debt may also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on our operations than we currently have 

our ability to make scheduled principal payments of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance which may be affected by factors beyond our control if we are unable to service our indebtedness our business financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 

we may be negatively impacted by legal and regulatory proceedings 

we are subject to various laws ordinances regulations and other requirements of government authorities in foreign countries and in the united states any violation of which could potentially create substantial liability for us and damage our reputation changes in laws ordinances regulations or other government policies the nature timing and effect of which are uncertain may significantly increase our expenses and liabilities 

from time to time we are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings that are incidental to the operation of our businesses or the business operations of previously owned entities these proceedings may seek remedies relating to environmental matters tax intellectual property acquisitions or divestitures product liability and personal injury claims privacy employment labor and pension matters government contract issues and commercial or contractual disputes our continuing transition to connected or digital technologies and solutions has increased our exposure to intellectual property litigation and we expect that this risk will continue to increase as we execute on our innovation and technology priorities 

it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of claims investigations regulatory proceedings and lawsuits and we could in the future incur judgments fines or penalties or enter into settlements and claims that could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in any particular period additionally we may be required to change or cease operations at one or more facilities if a regulatory agency determines that we have failed to comply with laws regulations or orders applicable to our business 

the global and diverse nature of our operations coupled with the increase in regulation and enforcement in many regions of the globe means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal and regulatory proceedings and other contingencies the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty will arise from time to time in addition subsequent developments in legal and regulatory proceedings may affect our assessments and estimates of loss contingencies recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments in excess of our reserves which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

weather conditions and climate changes may adversely affect or cause volatility in our financial results 

weather conditions including heavy flooding droughts and fluctuations in temperatures or weather patterns including as a result of climate change can positively or negatively impact portions of our business within the dewatering space pumps provided through our godwin and flygt brands are used to remove excess or unwanted water heavy flooding due to weather conditions drives increased demand for these applications on the other hand drought conditions drive higher demand for pumps used in agricultural and turf irrigation applications such as those provided by our goulds water technology and lowara brands fluctuations to warmer and cooler temperatures result in varying levels of demand for products used in residential and commercial applications where homes and buildings are heated and cooled with hvac units such as those provided by our bg brand the unpredictable nature of weather conditions and climate change may result in volatility for certain portions of our business as well as the operations of certain of our customers and suppliers 

if we do not or cannot adequately protect our intellectual property if third parties infringe our intellectual property rights or if third parties claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights we may suffer competitive injury expend significant resources enforcing our rights or defending against such claims or be prevented from selling products or services 

we own numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others which in the aggregate are important to our business the intellectual property rights that we obtain however may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage because they may not be sufficiently broad or may be challenged invalidated circumvented independently developed or designedaround particularly in countries where intellectual property rights laws are not highly developed protected or enforced our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we receive notices from third parties alleging intellectual property infringement or misappropriation any dispute or litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation in addition as a result of such claims of infringement or misappropriation we could lose our rights to critical technology be unable to license critical technology or sell critical products and services be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights or be required to redesign our products at substantial cost any of which could adversely impact our competitive position financial condition and results of operations even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation we may incur significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

a significant portion of our products and offerings in our measurement  control solutions segment are affected by the availability and regulation of radio spectrum and could be affected by interference with the radio spectrum that we use 

a significant portion of the offering in our measurement  control solutions segment use radio spectrum which is subject to government regulation to the extent we introduce new products designed for use in the united states or another country into a new market such products may require significant modification or redesign in order to meet frequency requirements and other regulatory specifications in some countries limitations on frequency availability or the cost of making necessary modifications may preclude us from selling our products in those countries the regulations that govern our use of the radio spectrum may change and the changes may require us to modify our products or seek new partnerships either directly or due to interference caused by new consumer products allowed under the regulations the inability to modify our products to meet such requirements the possible delays in completing such modifications and the cost of such modifications all could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition suitable partners for codevelopment may not be able to be secured by us 

in the united states our products are primarily designed to use licensed spectrum in the 900mhz range if the federal communications commission “fcc” did not renew our existing spectrum licenses our business could be adversely affected in addition there may be insufficient available frequencies in some markets to sustain or develop our planned operations at a commercially feasible price or at all 

outside of the united states certain of our products require the use of radio frequency and are subject to regulations in some jurisdictions radio station licenses may be granted for a fixed term and must be periodically renewed our advanced and smart metering systems offering transmits to and receives information from if applicable handheld mobile or fixed network reading devices in licensed bands made available to us through strategic partnerships and are reliant to some extent on the licensed spectrum continuing to be available through our partners or our customers we may be unable to find partners or customers that have access to sufficient frequencies in some markets to sustain or develop our planned operations or to find partners or customers that have access to sufficient frequencies in the relevant markets at a commercially feasible price or at all 

we may incur impairment charges for our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets which would negatively impact our operating results 

we have a significant amount of goodwill and purchased intangible assets on our balance sheet as a result of acquisitions we have completed as of december 31 2018  the net carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets totaled approximately  3 billion  the carrying value of goodwill represents the fair 

value of an acquired business in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date the carrying value of indefinitelived intangible assets represents the fair value of trademarks trade names and fcc licenses as of the acquisition date we do not amortize goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets that we expect to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows but instead we evaluate these assets for impairment at least annually or more frequently if interim indicators suggest that a potential impairment could exist a goodwill impairment charge will be recognized if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets failure of the fcc to renew licenses divestitures and market capitalization declines may impair our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets any charges relating to such impairments could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we cannot make assurances that we will pay dividends on our common stock or continue to repurchase our common stock under board approved share repurchase plans and likewise our indebtedness could limit our ability to pay dividends or make share repurchases 

the timing declaration amount and payment of future dividends to our shareholders fall within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on many factors including our financial condition results of operations and capital requirements as well as applicable law regulatory constraints industry practice and other business considerations that our board of directors considers relevant there can be no assurance that we will pay a dividend in the future or continue to pay dividends 

further the timing and amount of the repurchase of our common stock under board approved share repurchase plans has similar dependencies as the payment of dividends and accordingly there can be no assurances that we will repurchase our common stock 

additionally if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our debt payment obligations then our ability to pay dividends if so determined by the board of directors or make share repurchases will be impaired and we may be required to attempt to restructure or refinance our debt raise additional capital or take other actions such as selling assets reducing or delaying capital expenditures reducing our dividend or delaying or curtailing share repurchases there can be no assurance however that any such actions could be effected on satisfactory terms if at all or would be permitted by the terms of our debt or our other credit and contractual arrangements 

developments in environmental laws and regulations could impact our financial condition or results of operations 

our operations product and service offerings are subject to and affected by many federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations in addition we could be affected by future environmental laws or regulations including for example those imposed in response to climate change concerns compliance with current and future environmental laws and regulations currently requires and is expected to continue to require operating and capital expenditures 

environmental laws and regulations may authorize substantial fines and criminal sanctions as well as facility shutdowns to address violations and may require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit emissions or discharges we also incur and expect to continue to incur costs to comply with current environmental laws and regulations 

developments such as the adoption of new environmental laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations violations by us of such laws and regulations discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination litigation involving environmental impacts our inability to recover costs associated with any such developments or financial insolvency of other responsible parties could in the future have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

the level of returns on postretirement benefit plan assets changes in interest rates and other factors could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods 

certain members of our current and retired employee population are covered by pension and other employeerelated defined benefit plans collectively postretirement benefit plans we may experience significant fluctuations in costs related to our postretirement benefit plans as a result of macroeconomic factors such as interest rates that are beyond our control the cost of our postretirement plans is incurred over long periods of time and involves factors and uncertainties during those periods which can be volatile and unpredictable including rates of return on postretirement benefit plan assets discount rates used to calculate liabilities and expenses and rates of future compensation increases management develops each assumption using relevant plan and company experience and expectations in conjunction with marketrelated data our liquidity financial position including shareholders’ 

equity and results of operations could be materially affected by significant changes in key economic indicators actuarial experience financial market volatility future legislation and other governmental regulatory actions 

we make contributions to fund our postretirement benefit plans when considered necessary or advantageous to do so the macroeconomic factors discussed above including the return on postretirement benefit plan assets and the minimum funding requirements established by local government funding or taxing authorities or established by other agreement may influence future funding requirements a significant decline in the fair value of our plan assets or other adverse changes to our overall pension and other employeerelated benefit plans could require us to make significant funding contributions and affect cash flows in future periods 

the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly 

we cannot predict the prices at which our common stock may trade the market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely depending on many factors some of which may be beyond our control including 

 stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents and indiana law could delay or prevent a change in control 

certain provisions of our fourth amended and restated articles of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may delay or prevent a merger or acquisition of part or all of our business operations for example our articles of incorporation and our bylaws among other things require advance notice for shareholder proposals and nominations in addition our articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock these provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals of our business operations or delay or prevent a change in control which could harm our stock price indiana law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 10 or more of our outstanding common stock and us 

in connection with our spinoff itt now itt llc and exelis acquired by harris inc will indemnify us for certain liabilities and we will indemnify itt now itt llc or exelis for certain liabilities if we are required to indemnify itt now itt llc or exelis we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations and our financial results could be negatively impacted in the case of itts or exelis indemnity there can be no assurance that those indemnities will be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of such liabilities or as to itts or exelis ability to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future 

pursuant to the distribution agreement and certain other agreements with itt now itt llc and exelis itt now itt llc and exelis agreed to indemnify us from certain liabilities and we agreed to indemnify itt now itt llc and exelis for certain liabilities indemnities that we may be required to provide itt now itt llc and exelis may be significant and could negatively impact our business third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that itt now itt llc or exelis has agreed to retain further there can be no assurance that the indemnities from itt now itt llc and exelis will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities or that itt now itt llc and exelis will be able to fully satisfy their indemnification obligations moreover even if we ultimately were to succeed in recovering from itt now itt llc and exelis any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves each of these risks could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition

2018 versus 2017 

revenue 

revenue generated for 2018 was 5207 million  an increase of 500 million  or 106  compared to 4707 million in 2017  on a constant currency basis revenue grew 101 during 2018 this increase in revenue at constant currency was primarily driven by an increase in organic revenue of 390 million reflecting strong organic growth across all major regions with the vast majority of growth coming from north america the emerging markets particularly in china and latin america as well as in western europe acquisition revenue of 111 million also contributed to the increase partially offset by a reduction in revenue related to divestitures of 24 million during the period 

the following table illustrates the impact on 2018 revenue from organic growth recent acquisitions and divestitures and foreign currency translation in relation to revenue 



 water infrastructure 

water infrastructure’s revenue increased 172 million  or 86  in 2018 88 increase on a constant currency basis compared to 2017  revenue was negatively impacted by 4 million of foreign currency translation with the change at constant currency coming entirely from organic growth during the year of 176 million  or 88  organic growth for the year was driven by strength in the utility end market across all geographic regions with particularly strong growth coming from the emerging markets especially china as well as from the united states organic growth during the year was also driven by strength in the industrial end market primarily in north america and europe while emerging market industrial strength in latin america was partially offset by declines in asia pacific due to the lapping of a large ozone project delivery in china last year 

from an application perspective organic revenue growth for the year was largely attributable to our transport application the transport application grew due to strength across all geographic regions growth in north america was driven by modest share gains and continued focus by utility customers on improving infrastructure as well as strong dewatering rental sales and oil and gas growth project deliveries in western europe and product localization in china also contributed to the transport application growth during the period with china having 356 organic growth for the year organic revenue from our treatment application also contributed significantly to the segments growth across all regions particularly from strong utility project deliveries in china with 421 growth for the year 

applied water 

applied water’s revenue increased 113 million  or 80  in 2018  with revenue benefiting from 10 million of foreign currency translation during the year the revenue growth at constant currency was 103 million or 72  and consisted of organic growth of 113 million  or 80  partially offset by 10 million of reduction in revenue related to divestitures organic growth for the year was driven primarily by strength in the commercial and industrial end markets primarily in the united states and asia pacific as well as modest growth in the residential end market 

from an application perspective commercial building services revenue was primarily driven by distributor strength and commercial building construction growth coupled with price realization in the united states and project deployments in china and india organic revenue growth in the industrial water application was driven primarily by recovery in large project business and healthy general industrial demand in the united states as well as strong strength in the emerging markets particularly china and latin america residential building services also had modest organic growth primarily from strength in western europe partially offset by declines in asia pacific 

measurement  control solutions 

measurement  control solutions revenue increased 215 million  or 168  in 2018  154 increase on a constant currency basis with revenue benefiting from 17 million of foreign currency translation during the year revenue growth at constant currency consisted of revenue contributed by acquisitions of 111 million and organic revenue growth of 101 million or 79 which was partially offset by 14 million of reduction in revenue related to divestitures during the year organic revenue growth for the year was primarily driven by strength in the utility end market in north america 

from an application perspective organic revenue from the gas application contributed the most organic growth for the segment driven entirely by large project deployments in north america the water application also drove organic growth with large project deployments and increased water shipments in the unites states and asia pacific partially offset by declines in europe software as a service  other also had significant growth from large deployments in the united states and the united kingdom additional organic revenue growth came from the test application which saw growth in both the utility and industrial end markets primarily in western europe and the united states partially offset by declines in the emerging markets the electric application also had modest organic growth in north america during the year 

ordersbacklog 

 orders received during 2018 increased by 569 million  or 117  to  5437 million  111 increase on a constant currency basis order growth was favorably impacted by 27 million of foreign currency translation during the year the order increase on a constant currency basis included organic order growth of 454 million  or 93  over the prior year orders from acquisitions of 115 million also contributed to the growth at constant currency partially offset by a reduction in orders related to divestitures of 27 million during the year 

water infrastructure segment orders increased 143 million  or 68  to 2255 million  66 increase on a constant currency basis orders growth for the segment benefited from 3 million of foreign currency translation for the year the order increase on a constant currency basis consisted entirely of an increase in organic orders organic orders grew in both of the segment applications the treatment application had very strong order intake driven by orders in china the united states and india transport order growth was driven by increased strength in north america primarily from dewatering rental and equipment orders along with overall strong market conditions and order strength in europe transport order growth during the year was partially offset by custom pump project timing in india 

orders increased in our applied water segment by 81 million  or 55  to 1557 million  48 increase on a constant currency basis orders growth for the segment benefited from 10 million of foreign currency translation for the year the order increase on a constant currency basis included organic order growth of 83 million or 56  driven by strong commercial and industrial performance in the united states as well as modest strength in europe and the emerging markets partially offset by the reduction in orders from divestitures of 12 million 

orders increased in our measurement  control solutions segment by  345 million  or 270  to 1625 million  259 increase on a constant currency basis orders growth for the segment benefited from 14 million of foreign currency translation for the year the order increase on a constant currency basis included orders from recent acquisitions of 115 million partially offset by the reduction of orders from divestitures of 15 million and organic order growth of 231 million or 180 organic order growth primarily driven by orders within the water application in north america and a large order in india the gas and software as a service  other applications also had strong organic order growth in north america as well as asia pacific while electric orders were only slightly up for the year 

backlog includes contractual customer commitments as well as orders on hand as of the end of the period delivery schedules vary from customer to customer based upon their requirements annual or multiyear contracts are subject to rescheduling and cancellation by customers due to the longterm nature of the contracts as such beginning total backlog plus orders minus revenues will not equal ending total backlog due to contract adjustments foreign currency fluctuations and other factors typically large projects require longer lead production cycles and deployment schedules and delays can occur from time to time total backlog was 1689 million at december 31 2018 and 1513 million at december 31 2017  an increase of 116  this year over year increase in backlog of 176 million includes approximately 42 million of backlog from 2018 acquisitions we anticipate that approximately 65 of our total backlog at december 31 2018 will be recognized as revenue during 2019  

gross margin 

gross margins as a percentage of consolidated revenue decreased 30 basis points to 389 in 2018 as compared to 392 in 2017  the gross margin decrease was primarily driven by the negative impact of cost inflation unfavorable mix increased amortization of external sale software net negative currency impacts and purchase accounting impacts these unfavorable impacts were partially offset by cost reductions from global procurement and productivity improvement initiatives price realization and reductions in sensus acquisition related costs and realignment costs 

operating expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses 

sga increased by 72 million increase of 66  to 223 of revenue in 2018  as compared to 231 of revenue in 2017  the improvement in sga as a percent of revenue for the year was primarily driven by favorable volume impacts partially offset by the absence of sensus acquisition related charges that did not recur in 2018 additional sga from recent acquisitions also added to the increase in sga expenses as compared to the prior year 

research and development expenses 

rd spending was 189 million or 36 of revenue in 2018 as compared to 181 million or 38 of revenue in 2017  additionally we capitalized rd on external sale software of 60 million in 2018 as compared to 46 million in 2017 our increased spending on rd is driven by our continued commitment to innovation and technology development

during 2018  we incurred restructuring costs of 9 million  2 million and 9 million in our water infrastructure applied water and measurement  control solutions segments respectively we incurred these charges related to actions taken in 2018 primarily as a continuation of our efforts to reposition our european and north american businesses to optimize our cost structure and improve our operational efficiency and effectiveness the charges included the reduction of headcount and consolidation of facilities within our measurement  control solutions and water infrastructure segments as well as headcount reductions within our applied water segment 

during 2017  we recognized restructuring costs of 7 million  8 million and 5 million in our water infrastructure applied water and measurement  control solutions respectively these charges were incurred primarily in an effort to realign our organizational structure in europe and north america to optimize our cost structure the charges included the reduction of headcount and consolidation of facilities within our applied water and water infrastructure segments as well as headcount reductions within our measurement  control solutions segment 

the following table presents expected restructuring spend 



the water infrastructure applied water and measurement  control solutions actions commenced in 2018 consist primarily of severance charges and are expected to continue through the third quarter of 2019 the water infrastructure applied water and measurement  control solutions actions commenced in 2017 consist primarily of severance charges and are expected to continue through the second quarter of 2020 the water infrastructure applied water measurement  control solutions and corporate actions commenced in 2016 consist primarily of severance charges and are complete as a result of the actions initiated in 2018 we achieved savings of approximately 2 million in 2018 and estimate annual future net savings beginning in 2019 of approximately 7 million resulting in 5 million of incremental savings from the 2018 actions 

asset impairment charges 

during the fourth quarter of 2018 we determined that certain software assets within our water infrastructure segment were impaired accordingly we recognized an impairment charge of 2 million 

during the first quarter of 2017 we determined that certain assets within our applied water segment including a tradename were impaired accordingly we recognized an impairment charge of 5 million refer to note 11 goodwill and other intangible assets for additional information 

operating income 

we generated operating income of 654 million operating margin of 126 for 2018  reflecting an increase of 102 million  or 185  when compared to operating income of  552 million operating margin of 117 during the prior year the increase in operating margin was primarily due to cost reductions resulting from our global procurement and productivity initiatives favorable volume impacts and price realization and a decrease in sensus acquisition related costs these favorable impacts on operating margin were partially offset by cost inflation increases increased spending on strategic investments unfavorable mix an increase in restructuring and realignment costs and an increase in special charges purchase accounting impacts also negatively affected operating margin 

adjusted operating income was 714 million adjusted operating margin of 137 for 2018 reflecting an increase of 88 million or 141 when compared to adjusted operating income of 626 million adjusted operating margin of 133 during the prior year the increase in adjusted operating margin was mostly due to the same factors impacting operating income except for the decrease in sensus acquisition related costs the increase in restructuring and realignment costs and the increase in special charges as these costs were not included in adjusted operating income 

the table below provides a reconciliation of total and each segments operating income to adjusted operating income and a calculation of the corresponding adjusted operating margin 



nm not meaningful 

water infrastructure 

operating income for our water infrastructure segment increased 47 million  or 151  with operating margin also increasing from 156 to 165  a 90 basis point increase as compared to the prior year operating margin was negatively impacted year over year by increased restructuring and realignment costs of 4 million and special charges of 2 million incurred in 2018 excluding these items adjusted operating income increased 53 million  or 162  with adjusted operating margin increasing from 164 to 175  a 110 basis point increase as compared to the prior year the increase in adjusted operating margin was primarily due to cost reductions from our global procurement and productivity initiatives favorable volume and price realization which were partially offset by cost inflation unfavorable mix increased spending on strategic investments and negative currency impacts 

applied water 

operating income for our applied water segment increased 42 million  or 216  with operating margin also increasing from 137 to 154  a 170 basis point increase as compared to the prior year operating margin was positively impacted by special charges of 5 million incurred in 2017 that did not recur and decreased restructuring and realignment costs of 7 million in 2018 excluding these items adjusted operating income increased 30 million  or 139  with adjusted operating margin increasing from 152 to 160  an 80 basis point increase as compared to the prior year the increase in adjusted operating margin was primarily due to cost reductions from our global procurement and productivity initiatives favorable volume and price realization which were partially offset by cost inflation negative transactional currency impacts and unfavorable mix 

measurement  control solutions 

operating income for our measurement  control solutions segment increased 8 million or 73 with operating margin decreasing from 86 to 79 a 70 basis point decrease as compared to the prior year operating margin was negatively impacted by an increase of 10 million in restructuring and realignment costs and 5 million in special charges incurred in 2018 this impact was offset by 15 million of sensus acquisition related costs incurred during the year in 2017 that did not recur excluding these items adjusted operating income increased 8 million or 60 with adjusted operating margin decreasing from 104 to 94 a 100 basis point decrease as compared to the prior year the decrease in adjusted operating margin was primarily due to increases in cost inflation spending on strategic investments and unfavorable mix impacts due to large energy project deployments purchase accounting impacts also negatively affected operating margin these impacts were partially offset by favorable volume and price realization and cost reductions from our global procurement and productivity initiatives 

corporate and other 

operating expense for corporate and other decreased 5 million  or 78  compared to the prior year primarily due to a reduction of sensus acquisition related costs and special charges excluding these costs adjusted operating expense increased 3 million  or 59 compared to the prior year mostly driven by an increase in employee related noncash sharebased compensation costs 

interest expense 

interest expense remained constant at 82 million for both 2018 and 2017  see note 14 credit facilities and debt of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our credit facilities and longterm debt and related interest 

income tax expense 

tax act 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” the tax act makes broad and complex changes to the us tax code as noted at 2017 year end we reasonably estimated certain effects and therefore as permitted by sab 118 recorded provisional estimates associated with the reduction of us federal corporate tax rate and deemed repatriation transition tax our accounting for the reduction of us federal corporate tax rate is complete we recorded a provisional tax benefit for corporate tax rate reduction of 107 million as of december 31 2017 upon further analysis of our deferred tax assets and liabilities we recognized a measurementperiod adjustment of 15 million as an additional decrease of the net deferred tax liabilities and recorded a corresponding deferred tax benefit of 15 million during the period ended december 31 2018 the effect of this measurement period adjustment on the 2018 effective tax rate was about 03 a total decrease of the net deferred tax liabilities of 108 million has been recorded for the corporate rate reduction with a corresponding deferred tax benefit of 108 million 

our accounting for the deemed repatriation transition tax transition tax is complete we made an estimate of the transition tax and recorded a provisional transition tax liability of 153 million as of december 31 2017 on the basis of revised ep computations that were completed and additional guidance we recognized a measurementperiod adjustment of a 9 million decrease to the income tax expense in 2018 the effect of the measurementperiod adjustment on the 2018 effective tax rate was approximately 16 a total transition tax obligation to date of 144 million has been recorded with a corresponding adjustment of 144 million to income tax expense 

the income tax provision for 2018 was 36 million at an effective tax rate of 61 compared to 136 million at an effective tax rate of 292 in 2017  the 2018 effective tax rate is lower than 2017 primarily due to the impact of an intercompany sale of assets the reduction of the transition tax and the reduction of the us federal corporate rate in 2018 partially offset by the 2017 benefit from the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities 

see note 7 income taxes of our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the tax act 

other comprehensive loss income 

other comprehensive loss was 111 million in 2018 as compared to income of 108 million in 2017  this decrease was primarily driven by unfavorable foreign currency translation impacts due to the weakening of the euro great british pound canadian dollar south african rand polish zloty swedish krona amongst other various currencies against the us dollar in the current year versus strengthening for the same period in the prior year these decreases were partially offset by the favorable impact from movement in our euro net investment hedges the tax impact on the movement in the net investment hedges also contributed to the year over year decrease 

2017 versus 2016 

revenue 

revenue generated for 2017 was 4707 million an increase of 936 million or 248 compared to 3771 million in 2016 on a constant currency basis revenue grew 239 this increase in revenue was primarily driven by additional revenue of 790 million from acquisitions there was also strong organic growth of 122 million during the year driven primarily by north america as well as strength in the emerging markets particularly in china and india additionally to a lesser extent europe contributed to this organic growth despite ongoing weakness in the united kingdom during the year 

the following table illustrates the impact on 2017 revenue from organic growth recent acquisitions and divestitures and foreign currency translation in relation to revenue 





water infrastructure 

water infrastructure’s revenue increased 72 million or 37 in 2017 29 increase on a constant currency basis compared to 2016 revenue benefited from 16 million of foreign currency translation for the year and included organic growth of 56 million or 29 

organic growth for the year was driven by strength in the industrial end market and to a lesser extent in the utility end market the growth in both of these end markets was driven by strength from asia pacific and north america 

from an application perspective organic revenue growth was driven primarily by our transport application the transport application grew in the industrial end market due to strength in the dewatering business which benefited from the recovery of the industrial construction market particularly within the distribution channel and recovery of oil and gas and mining markets in north america and latin america the transport application also grew in the utility end market driven by increased municipal spending in north america and increased projects in the middle east and india organic revenue from our treatment application also contributed to the segments growth primarily from growth in china from industrial treatment project deliveries as well as growth in europe from municipal treatment projects 

applied water 

applied water’s revenue increased 28 million or 20 in 2017 17 increase on a constant currency basis compared to 2016 revenue benefited from 4 million of foreign currency translation for the year and the constant currency increase included organic growth of 34 million or 24 

organic growth for the year was driven by strength in the residential and commercial end markets in the united states asia pacific and western europe which were partially offset by declines in the industrial market 

from an application perspective growth in residential building services was primarily driven by strength in the united states where we benefited from the timing of promotions and market share gains and continued strength in asia pacific commercial building services also grew primarily in north america western europe and asia pacific driven by new product traction and sales channel investments this growth was partially offset by a decline in industrial applications primarily driven by unfavorable weather conditions impacting the agriculture business in the united states partially offset by strength in western europe 

measurement  control solutions 

measurement  control solutions revenue increased 836 million or 1874 in 2017 1843 on a constant currency basis compared to 2016 the revenue increase for the year was almost entirely from 790 million of revenue related to acquisitions that we did not have in the prior year most of the additional revenue contributed by the sensus business was generated in the united states with additional revenue coming primarily from western europe and china the majority of the sensus business revenue came from water applications with gas and electric applications making up most of the remaining sales for the year organic revenue growth in the measurement  control solutions segment was 32 million or 72 for the year organic growth was driven primarily by growth across all applications except electric which had slight declines much of the organic revenue increase was in the water application which had increased ami deployments in north america as well as higher demand for iperl product in eastern europe and the middle east organic revenue also increased in the gas application primarily due to ami deployments in north america as well as in the software and services application primarily driven by a couple of major contract upgrades the test application also contributed to the increase in organic revenue as a result of strength from the environmental monitoring business in the united states 

ordersbacklog 



 orders received during 2017 increased by 1044 million or 273 to 4868 million 264 increase on a constant currency basis the order growth on a constant currency basis was primarily driven by additional orders from recent acquisitions primarily sensus of 762 million organic order growth was 260 million or 68 over the prior year 

water infrastructure segment orders increased 155 million or 79 to 2112 million 71 growth on a constant currency basis orders benefited from 16 million of foreign currency translation for the year and included organic growth of 139 million or 71 the majority of the organic order growth for the segment came from the transport application driven by the utility sector in the united states as well as strong project orders in china and india additionally dewatering distributor orders increased driven by storm related activity and the strengthening of the oil and gas markets treatment applications also had strong order intake primarily from projects in the emerging markets latin america and north america 

orders increased in our applied water segment by 71 million or 51 to 1476 million 48 increase on a constant currency basis the order increase was primarily due to organic order growth of 79 million or 56 driven by strength in the emerging markets and strong commercial building and industrial performance in north america which was partially offset by the loss of orders related to divested businesses of 11 million 

orders increased in our measurement  control solutions segment by 818 million or 1771 to 1280 million 1740 growth on a constant currency basis this increase included orders from recent acquisitions primarily sensus of 762 million and organic order growth of 42 million or 91 primarily from sensus order increases in north america for most applications as well as increased orders from test application strength in the united states and china 

backlog includes contractual customer commitments as well as orders on hand as of the end of the period delivery schedules vary from customer to customer based upon their requirements annual or multiyear contracts are subject to rescheduling and cancellation by customers due to the longterm nature of the contracts as such beginning total backlog plus orders minus revenues will not equal ending total backlog due to contract adjustments foreign currency fluctuations and other factors typically large projects require longer lead production cycles and deployment schedules and delays can occur from time to time total backlog was 1513 million at december 31 2017 and 1292 million at december 31 2016 an increase of 17 the december 31 2016 backlog balance has been revised to include contractual agreements that sensus has with customers that do not have minimum commitments but which we believe will be executed upon over the terms of the contracts this year over year increase in backlog of 221 million is due to strong order growth in the fourth quarter across all of our segments as well as benefits from currency translation impacts we anticipate that over 60 of our total backlog at december 31 2017 will be recognized as revenue during 2018 

gross margin 

gross margins as a percentage of consolidated revenue increased to 392 in 2017 from 388 in 2016 the gross margin increase was primarily due to the benefits realized from cost reductions from global procurement and continuous improvement initiatives as well as a decrease in the inventory stepup charge for sensus in 2017 these positive impacts on gross margin were partially offset by cost inflation and unfavorable product mix 

operating expense 

selling general and administrative expenses 

sga increased by 175 million increase of 191 to 231 of revenue in 2017 as compared to 242 of revenue in 2016 the increase in sga expenses includes approximately 160 million of incremental sga spending for the sensus business that we did not have prior to the acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2016 the remaining increases in sga expenses were primarily due to inflation investments in regional sales channels and operational capabilities and foreign currency impacts which were partially offset by savings from restructuring and other cost actions 

research and development expenses 

rd spending increased 71 million or 645 to 38 of revenue in 2017 as compared to 29 of revenue in 2016 primarily due to additional rd spend from our recent acquisitions and investments in new products and technologies 

restructuring charges 

restructuring charges 

during 2017 we incurred restructuring costs of 7 million 8 million and 5 million in our water infrastructure applied water and measurement  control solutions segments respectively we incurred these charges related to actions taken in 2017 primarily as a continuation of our efforts to reposition our european and north american businesses to optimize our cost structure and improve our operational efficiency and effectiveness the charges included the reduction of headcount and consolidation of facilities within our applied water and water infrastructure segments as well as headcount reductions within our measurement  control solutions segment 

during 2016 we recognized restructuring costs of 12 million 10 million 6 million and 2 million in our water infrastructure applied water measurement  control solutions and corporate respectively these charges were incurred primarily in an effort to realign our organizational structure in europe and north america to optimize our cost structure the charges relate to the reduction in structural costs including a decrease in headcount and consolidation of facilities 

the following table presents expected restructuring spend 



the water infrastructure applied water measurement  control solutions and corporate actions commenced in 2017 consist primarily of severance charges and are expected to continue through the end of 2018 the water infrastructure applied water measurement  control solutions and corporate actions commenced in 2016 consist primarily of severance charges and are largely complete the water infrastructure applied water and measurement  control solutions actions commenced in 2015 consist primarily of severance charges and are complete as a result of these actions initiated in 2017 we achieved savings of approximately 4 million in 2017 and estimate annual future net savings beginning in 2018 of approximately 15 million resulting in 11 million of incremental savings from the 2017 actions 

asset impairment charges 

during the first quarter of 2017 we determined that certain assets within our applied water segment including a tradename were impaired accordingly we recognized an impairment charge of 5 million refer to note 11 goodwill and other intangible assets for additional information 

operating income 

we generated operating income of 552 million operating margin of 117 during 2017 reflecting an increase of 144 million or 353 when compared to operating income of 408 million operating margin of 108 during the prior year this increase in operating income was largely driven by the inclusion of sensus operating income for the full year in 2017 sensus acquisition related costs and restructuring and realignment costs decreased 31 million and 6 million respectively while special charges increased 6 million when compared to the prior year period excluding these costs adjusted operating income was 626 million adjusted operating margin of 133 for 2017 as compared to 513 million adjusted operating margin of 136 for 2016 the decrease in adjusted operating margin was mostly due to cost inflation increases increased spending on strategic investments and sensus purchase accounting impacts which were largely offset by cost savings from our global procurement and productivity initiatives and restructuring savings the noncash sensus purchase accounting impact on adjusted operating margin for the year was 50 basis points 

the table below provides a reconciliation of the total and each segments operating income to adjusted operating income and a calculation of the corresponding adjusted operating margin 

nm not meaningful 

water infrastructure 

operating income for our water infrastructure segment increased 17 million or 58 with operating margin also increasing from 153 to 156 a 30 basis point increase as compared to the prior year operating margin was positively impacted year over year by special charges of 2 million in 2016 that did not recur while restructuring and realignment costs remained flat excluding these items adjusted operating income increased 15 million or 48 with adjusted operating margin increasing from 162 to 164 a 20 basis point increase as compared to the prior year the increase in adjusted operating margin was primarily due to cost reductions from global procurement and continuous improvement initiatives as well as restructuring savings and favorable volume these drivers were partially offset by increases in cost inflation and spending on strategic investments as well as unfavorable transactional foreign currency impacts 

applied water 

operating income for our applied water segment increased 6 million or 32 with operating margin also increasing from 135 to 137 a 20 basis point increase as compared to the prior year operating margin was negatively impacted by higher special charges for a noncash impairment of 5 million and a 1 million increase in restructuring and realignment costs excluding these items adjusted operating income increased 12 million or 59 with adjusted operating margin increasing from 146 to 152 an 60 basis point increase as compared to the prior year the increase in adjusted operating margin was primarily due to cost reductions from global procurement and continuous improvement initiatives and restructuring savings which were partially offset by increases in cost inflation unfavorable mix and the impact from the change in accounting for pension costs 

measurement  control solutions 

operating income for our measurement  control solutions segment increased 110 million operating margin of 86 for the year as compared to operating income and margin of zero in 2016 operating margin was positively impacted by decreases in sensus acquisition related costs restructuring and realignment costs and special charges of 10 million 5 million and 3 million respectively excluding these items adjusted operating income increased 92 million or 2244 with most of the increase coming from the inclusion of the incremental adjusted operating income for sensus in 2017 adjusted operating margin increased from 92 to 104 a 120 basis point increase as compared to the prior year the increase in adjusted operating margin was primarily due to cost reductions from global procurement and continuous improvement initiatives restructuring savings and favorable volume impacts these drivers were partially offset by the inclusion of sensus margins which were negatively impacted by purchase accounting noncash sensus purchase accounting negatively impacted the segments full year adjusted operating margin by 200 basis points 

corporate and other 

operating expense for corporate and other decreased 11 million or 147 compared to the prior year primarily due to a 21 million decrease in sensus acquisition related costs and a 2 million decrease in restructuring and realignment costs this was partially offset by 6 million of special charges incurred during the year which we did not have in the prior year excluding these costs adjusted operating expense increased 6 million compared to the prior year driven mostly by employee related costs as well as the impact from the change in accounting for pension costs 

interest expense 

interest expense was 82 million and 70 million for 2017 and 2016 respectively the increased interest expense for the year includes additional interest expense in 2017 related to debt entered into in the fourth quarter of 2016 to fund our acquisition of sensus the increase in interest expense was partially offset by the reduction in special interest charges incurred in 2016 of 8 million in connection with the early extinguishment of our senior notes due in 2016 and 5 million of financing charges on the bridge loan related to the sensus acquisition neither of which recurred in 2017 as well as a lower interest rate on the senior notes due 2023 which effectively replaced the senior notes due in 2016 see note 14 credit facilities and debt of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our credit facilities and longterm debt and related interest 

income tax expense 

the income tax provision for 2017 was 136 million at an effective tax rate of 292 compared to 80 million at an effective tax rate of 235 in 2016 the 2017 effective tax rate is higher than 2016 due to the provisional one time deemed repatriation transition tax under the newly enacted tax cuts and jobs act partially offset by the benefit from the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities and the release of valuation allowances 

see note 7 income taxes of our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the tax act 

other comprehensive income 

other comprehensive income was 108 million in 2017 as compared to an 80 million loss in 2016 this increase was driven primarily by favorable foreign currency translation impacts primarily due to the strengthening of the euro great british pound chinese yuan polish zloty amongst other various currencies against the us dollar as compared to the weakening of these same currencies in the prior year partially offsetting these favorable movements was the euro movement on the companys net investment hedge as compared to the prior year the tax impact on the foreign currency translation related to the net investment hedge also contributed to the year over year increase finally year over year movement in foreign currency translation on postretirement benefit plans partially offset the increase in other comprehensive income 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash 

 sources and uses of liquidity 

operating activities 

during 2018  net cash provided by operating activities was 586 million  compared to 686 million in 2017  the 100 million yearoveryear decrease was primarily driven by an increased use of working capital for inventory which was built up at year end to maintain service levels impacted by component shortages as well as to make strategic purchases to manage tariff impacts operating cash also decreased during the period as a result of increased receivables from higher growth levels these negative impacts to operating cash flow were partially offset by increased cash from earnings during the year 

during 2017  net cash provided by operating activities was 686 million  compared to 497 million in 2016  the 189 million yearoveryear increase was primarily driven by increased cash from operating activities of the sensus business acquired in the fourth quarter of 2016 and strong operating cash performance across the rest of the business 

investing activities 

cash used in investing activities was 643 million in 2018  compared to 181 million in 2017  this increase of 462 million was primarily driven by the 433 million spent on 2018 acquisitions primarily the acquisition of pure technologies ltd versus the 33 million spent for various acquisition activities in the prior year spending on capital expenditures also increased by 67 million over the prior year primarily due to increased spending on software development building up of the dewatering rental fleet as well as increased spending on other strategic capital investments to meet increasing demand 

cash used in investing activities was 181 million in 2017 compared to 1886 million in 2016  the decrease of 1705 million was primarily driven by the 1782 million spent on the acquisition of sensus and two other businesses in 2016 as compared to the 33 million spent for acquisitions in 2017 this impact is partially offset by increased spending of 46 million over the prior year on capital projects including spending on capitalized software in the sensus business 

financing activities 

cash used by financing activities was 40 million in 2018  compared to cash used by financing activities of 421 in 2017 the decrease in cash used during the year was primarily due to the net issuance of 335 million in short term debt in the current year which was largely used for acquisition financing additionally short term debt repaid during the year was 52 million versus 282 million during the prior year period see note 14 credit facilities and longterm debt of our consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of debt activities these drivers are partially offset by the higher net repayment of 120 million of longterm debt in the current year an increase in share repurchase activity of 34 million and an increase in dividends paid of 22 million as compared to the prior year 

cash generated by financing activities was 421 million in 2017  compared to cash generated by financing activities of 1034 in 2016 in 2017  the net decrease in cash provided was primarily due to the issuance of longterm and shortterm debt related to acquisition financing in 2016 versus the net repayment of shortterm debt in 2017 see note 14 credit facilities and longterm debt of our consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of debt activities also contributing to the decrease in cash generated by financing activities were increased share repurchases and higher dividend payments in 2017 

funding and liquidity strategy 

our ability to fund our capital needs depends on our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access to bank financing and the capital markets historically we have generated operating cash flow sufficient to fund our primary cash needs centered on operating activities working capital capital expenditures strategic investments and dividends if our cash flows from operations are less than we expect we may need to incur debt or issue equity from time to time we may need to access the longterm and shortterm capital markets to obtain financing our access to and the availability of financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors including i our credit ratings or absence of a credit rating ii the liquidity of the overall capital markets and iii the current state of the economy there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or that such financing will be available at all 

we monitor our global funding requirements and seek to meet our liquidity needs on a cost effective basis based on our current global cash positions cash flows from operations and access to the commercial paper markets we believe there is sufficient liquidity to meet our funding requirements in addition our existing committed credit facilities and access to the public debt markets would provide further liquidity if required 

we anticipate that our present sources of funds including funds from operations and additional borrowings will provide us with sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet our liquidity and capital needs in both the united states and outside of the united states over the next twelve months 

credit facilities  longterm contractual commitments 

see note 14 credit facilities and longterm debt of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our credit facilities and longterm debt 

nonus operations 

for 2018 and 2017  we generated 53 and 54 of our revenue from nonus operations respectively as we continue to grow our operations in the emerging markets and elsewhere outside of the united states we expect to continue to generate significant revenue from nonus operations and expect that a substantial portion of our cash will be predominately held by our foreign subsidiaries we expect to manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed we may transfer cash from certain international subsidiaries to the us and other international subsidiaries when we believe it is cost effective to do so we continually review our domestic and foreign cash profile expected future cash generation and investment opportunities and reassess whether there is a need to repatriate funds held internationally to support our us operations as of december 31 2018  we have provided a deferred tax liability of 13 million for net foreign withholding taxes and state income taxes on 19 billion expected to be repatriated to the us parent 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual commitments as of december 31 2018  

in addition to the amounts presented in the table above we have recorded liabilities for net investment hedges of 46 million and employee severance indemnity of 16 million  these amounts have been excluded from the contractual obligations table due to an inability to reasonably estimate the timing or amounts of such payments in individual years further benefit payments which reflect expected future service related to the companys pension and other postretirement employee benefit obligations are presented in note 15  “postretirement benefit plans” of the consolidated financial statements and deferred income tax liabilities and uncertain tax positions are presented in note 7 income taxes of the consolidated financial statements and as such these obligations are not included in the above table finally estimated environmental payments and workers compensation and general liability reserves are excluded from the table above we estimate based on historical experience that we will spend approximately 2 million to 3 million per year on environmental investigation and remediation and approximately 4 million to 5 million per year on workers compensation and general liability at december 31 2018  we had estimated and accrued 4 million and 21 million related to environmental matters and workers compensation and general liability respectively 

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2018  we have issued guarantees for the debt and other obligations of consolidated subsidiaries in the normal course of business we have determined that none of these arrangements has a material current effect or is reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our consolidated financial statements financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

we obtain certain standby letters of credit bank guarantees and surety bonds from thirdparty financial institutions in the ordinary course of business when required under contracts or to satisfy insurance related requirements as of december 31 2018  the amount of standby letters of credit bank guarantees and surety bonds was 275 million  

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 

significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are discussed in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” of the consolidated financial statements accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they are inherently uncertain involve significant judgments include areas where different estimates reasonably could have been used and changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable however actual results in these areas could differ from management’s estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

revenue recognition as discussed in note 2 recently issued accounting pronouncements xylem adopted the new guidance on recognizing revenue from contracts with customers as of january 1 2018 in accordance with this new guidance xylem recognizes revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of promised goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which it expects to be entitled to for providing those goods and services for each arrangement with a customer we identify the contract the associated performance obligations within the contract determine the transaction price of that contract allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation and recognize revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied 

the satisfaction of performance obligations in a contract is based upon when the customer obtains control over the asset depending on the nature of the performance obligation control transfers either at a particular point in time or over time which determines the recognition pattern of revenue 

for product sales other than longterm constructiontype contracts we recognize revenue once control has passed at a point in time which is generally when products are shipped in instances where contractual terms include a provision for customer acceptance revenue is recognized when either i we have previously demonstrated that the product meets the specified criteria based on either seller or customer specified objective criteria or ii upon formal acceptance received from the customer where the product has not been previously demonstrated to meet customer specified objective criteria we recognize revenue on product sales to channel partners including resellers distributors or valueadded solution providers at the point in time when the risks and rewards possession and title have transferred to the customer which usually occurs at the point of delivery 

revenue from performance obligations related to services is recognized over time as the performance obligations are satisfied in these instances the customer consumes the benefit of the service as xylem performs 

certain businesses also enter into longterm constructiontype sales contracts where revenue is recognized over time in these instances revenue is recognized using a measure of progress that applies an input method based on costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs we also recognize revenue for certain of these arrangements using the output method and measure progress based on shipments of product where control has transferred to the customer 

for all contracts with customers we determine the transaction price in the arrangement and allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation identified in the contract judgment is required to determine the appropriate unit of account and we separate out the performance obligations if they are capable of being distinct and if they are distinct within the context of the contract the transaction price is adjusted for our estimate of variable consideration which may include a right of return discounts rebates penalties and retainage to estimate variable consideration we apply the expected value or the most likely amount method based on whichever method most appropriately predicts the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to the method applied is typically based on historical experience and known trends we constrain the amounts of variable consideration that are included in the transaction price to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur or when uncertainties around the variable consideration are resolved 

the adoption of the new revenue guidance did not provide materially different results from historical revenue guidance 

income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities applying enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences will reverse based on the evaluation of available evidence we recognize future tax benefits such as net operating loss carryforwards to the extent that we believe it is more likely than not we will realize these benefits we periodically assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets and reflect any changes to our estimate of the amount we are more likely than not to realize in the valuation allowance with a corresponding adjustment to earnings or other comprehensive income as appropriate 

in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we look to the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences taxable income in carryback years and the feasibility of tax planning strategies and estimated future taxable income the valuation allowance can be affected by changes to tax laws changes to statutory tax rates and changes to future taxable income estimates 

due to the tax act we have recorded net foreign withholding taxes and state income taxes on earnings that are expected to be repatriated to the us parent we have not recorded any deferred taxes on the amounts that the company currently does not intend to repatriate as the determination of any deferred taxes on this amount is not practicable 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities 

for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and to the extent to which additional taxes will be due furthermore we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities or litigation based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 

we adjust our liability for uncertain tax positions in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional tax expense would result if a payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 

business combinations we record acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting all of the assets acquired liabilities assumed contractual contingencies and contingent consideration is recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill the application of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in order to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill these assumptions and estimates include a market participant’s use of the asset and the appropriate discount rates for a market participant our estimates are based on historical experience information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and when appropriate includes assistance from independent thirdparty appraisal firms significant assumptions and estimates include but are not limited to the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future the cost to buildrecreate certain technology the appropriate weightedaverage cost of capital and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable in addition unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates 

goodwill and intangible assets we review goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable we also review the carrying value of our finitelived intangible assets for potential impairment when impairment indicators arise we conduct our annual impairment test as of the first day of the fourth quarter for goodwill the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is not impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value then an impairment charge is recognized for that excess up to the amount of recorded goodwill we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using an income approach we estimate the fair value of our intangible assets with indefinite lives using either the income approach or the market approach under the income approach we calculate fair value based on the present value of estimated future cash flows under the market approach we calculate fair value based on recent sales and selling prices of similar assets 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinitelived intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions particularly related to future operating results and cash flows these estimates and assumptions include but are not limited to revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates assumed royalty rates future economic and market conditions and identification of appropriate market comparable data in addition the identification of reporting units and the allocation of assets and liabilities to the reporting units when determining the carrying value of each reporting unit also require judgment goodwill is tested for impairment at either the operating segment identified in note 21  “segment and geographic data” of the consolidated financial statements or one level below the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets is based on estimates and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable significant changes to these estimates and assumptions could adversely impact our conclusions actual future results may differ from those estimates 

during the fourth quarter of 2018  we performed our annual impairment assessment and determined that the estimated fair values of our goodwill reporting units were in excess of their carrying values future goodwill impairment tests could result in a charge to earnings our aia business within our measurement  control solutions segment was the only goodwill reporting unit whose fair value was not substantially in excess of its carrying value the majority of this business was purchased during 2018 and was recorded at fair value in xylem’s financial statements as a result our 2018 assessment indicated that the fair value of the aia business exceeded its carrying 

value by less than 10 the goodwill associated with the aia business was 290 million at december 31 2018 we will continue to evaluate goodwill on an annual basis as of the beginning of our fourth quarter and whenever events and changes in circumstances require us to do so 

we determined that no impairment of the indefinitelived intangibles existed as of the measurement date in 2018  however future indefinitelived intangible impairment tests could result in a charge to earnings we will continue to evaluate indefinitelived intangibles on an annual basis as of the beginning of our fourth quarter and whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate there may be a potential impairment 

contingent liabilities as discussed in note 19  commitments and contingencies of the consolidated financial statements the company is from time to time involved in legal and regulatory proceedings that are incidental to the operation of our businesses or the business operations of previously owned entities the company recognizes a liability for any contingency that is known or probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable these assessments require judgments concerning matters such as litigation developments and outcomes the anticipated outcome of negotiations the number of future claims and the cost of both pending and future claims in addition because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time liabilities may change in the future due to various factors including those discussed in note 19 of the consolidated financial statements if the liabilities established by the company with respect to these contingencies are inadequate the company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the recorded liability which would adversely affect the company’s financial statements 

receivables and allowance for doubtful accounts and discounts receivables primarily comprise uncollected amounts owed to us from transactions with customers and are presented net of allowances for doubtful accounts and early payment discounts 

we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts using a combination of factors to reduce our trade receivable balances to their estimated net realizable amount we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a variety of factors including the length of time receivables are past due macroeconomic trends and conditions significant onetime events historical experience and the financial condition of customers in addition we record a specific reserve for individual accounts when we become aware of specific customer circumstances such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer’s operating results or financial position the past due or delinquency status of a receivable is based on the contractual payment terms of the receivable if circumstances related to the specific customer change we adjust estimates of the recoverability of receivables as appropriate we determine our allowance for early payment discounts primarily based on historical experience with customers 

credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is generally diversified due to the large number of entities comprising our customer base and their dispersion across many different geographical regions we perform ongoing credit evaluations of the financial condition of our thirdparty distributors resellers and other customers and require collateral such as letters of credit and bank guarantees in certain circumstances as of december 31 2018 and 2017 we do not believe we have any significant concentrations of credit risk 

postretirement plans company employees around the world participate in numerous defined benefit plans the determination of projected benefit obligations and the recognition of expenses related to these plans are dependent on various assumptions these major assumptions primarily relate to discount rates expected longterm rates of return on plan assets rate of future compensation increases mortality health care inflation and years of service some of which are disclosed in note 15  “postretirement benefit plans” of the consolidated financial statements and other factors actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized on a straightline basis only to the extent they exceed 10 of the higher of the marketrelated value or projected benefit obligation over the average remaining service period of active plan participants or for plans with all or substantially all inactive participants over the average remaining life expectancy 

significant assumptions 

management develops each assumption using relevant company experience in conjunction with marketrelated data for each individual country in which such plans exist all assumptions are reviewed annually with thirdparty consultants and adjusted as necessary the table included below provides the weighted average assumptions used to estimate our defined benefit pension obligations and costs as of and for the years ended 2018 and 2017  



 we determine the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets by evaluating both historical returns and estimates of future returns specifically the company analyzes the estimated future returns based on independent estimates of asset class returns and evaluates historical broad market returns over longterm timeframes based on the strategic asset allocation which is detailed in note 15  “postretirement benefit plans” of the consolidated financial statements 

based on the approach described above the chart below shows weighted average actual returns versus the weighted average expected longterm rates of return for our pension plans that were utilized in the calculation of the net periodic pension cost for each respective year 

for the recognition of net periodic pension cost the calculation of the expected return on plan assets is generally derived by applying the expected longterm rate of return to the marketrelated value of plan assets the marketrelated value of plan assets is based on average asset values at the measurement date over the last five years the use of fair value rather than a calculated value could materially affect net periodic pension cost the weighted average expected longterm rate of return for all of our plan assets to be used in determining net periodic benefit costs for 2019 is estimated at 709  we estimate that every 25 basis point change in the expected return on plan assets impacts the expense by 1 million 

the discount rate reflects our expectation of the present value of expected future cash payments for benefits at the measurement date a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense we base the discount rate assumption on current investment yields of highquality fixed income investments during the retirement benefits maturity period the pension discount rate was determined by considering an interest rate yield curve comprising aaaaa bonds with maturities between zero and 30 years developed by the plan’s actuaries annual benefit payments are then discounted to present value using this yield curve to develop a singlepoint discount rate matching the plan’s characteristics our weighted average discount rate for all pension plans effective january 1 2019  is 282  we estimate that every 25 basis point change in the discount rate impacts the expense by 1 million 

the rate of future compensation increase assumption reflects our longterm actual experience and future and nearterm outlook effective january 1 2019  our expected rate of future compensation is 302 for all pension plans the estimated impact of a 25 basis point change in the expected rate of future compensation is less than 1 million 

the assumed rate of future increases in the per capita cost of health care the health care trend rate is 824 for 2019  decreasing ratably to 448 in 2027 an increase or decrease in the health care trend rates by one percent per year would impact the aggregate annual service and interest components by less than 1 million and impact the benefit obligation by approximately 3 million 

we currently anticipate making contributions to our pension and postretirement benefit plans in the range of 15 

million to 25 million during 2019  of which 5 million is expected to be made in the first quarter 

funded status 

funded status is derived by subtracting the respective yearend values of the projected benefit obligations from the fair value of plan assets we estimate that every 25 basis point change in the discount rate impacts the funded status by approximately 29 million 

fair value of plan assets 

the plan assets of our pension plans comprise a broad range of investments including domestic and foreign equity securities interests in private equity and hedge funds fixed income investments insurance contracts and cash and cash equivalents 

a portion of our pension benefit plan assets portfolio comprises investments in private equity and hedge funds the private equity and hedge fund investments are generally measured at net asset value however in certain instances the values reported by the asset managers were not current at the measurement date accordingly we made estimate adjustments to the last reported value where necessary to measure the assets at fair value at the measurement date these adjustments consider information received from the asset managers as well as general market information the adjustment recorded at december 31 2018 and 2017 for these assets represented less than one percent of total plan assets in each respective year asset values for other positions were generally measured using market observable prices we estimate that a 5 change in asset values will impact funded status by approximately 26 million

 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates these exposures are actively monitored by management our exposure to foreign exchange rate risk is due to certain costs revenue and borrowings being denominated in currencies other than one of our subsidiaries functional currency similarly we are exposed to market risk as the result of changes in interest rates which may affect the cost of our financing it is our policy and practice to use derivative financial instruments only to the extent necessary to manage exposures 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we conduct approximately 53 of our business in various locations outside the united states 

our economic foreign currency risk primarily relates to receipts from customers payments to suppliers and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies we may use derivative financial instruments to offset risk related to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers when it is believed that the exposure will not be limited by our normal operating and financing activities we enter into currency forward contracts periodically in order to manage the exchange rate fluctuation risk on certain intercompany transactions associated with third party sales and purchases these risks are also mitigated by natural hedges including the presence of manufacturing facilities outside the united states global sourcing and other spending which occurs in foreign countries our principal foreign currency transaction exposures primarily relate to the euro swedish krona polish zloty canadian dollar british pound and australian dollar we estimate that a hypothetical 10 movement in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material economic impact to xylem’s financial position and results of operations 

additionally we are subject to foreign exchange translation risk due to changes in the value of foreign currencies in relation to our reporting currency the us dollar the translation risk is primarily concentrated in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro chinese yuan british pound canadian dollar swedish krona and australian dollar as the us dollar strengthens against other currencies in which we transact business revenue and income will generally be negatively impacted and if the us dollar weakens revenue and income will generally be positively impacted we expect to continue to generate significant revenue from nonus operations and we expect our cash will be predominately held by our foreign subsidiaries we expect to manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed we may transfer cash from certain international subsidiaries to the us and other international subsidiaries when it is cost effective to do so though we continually review our domestic and foreign cash profile expected future cash generation and investment opportunities and reassess whether there is a need to repatriate funds held internationally to support our us operations we also hedge our investment in certain foreign subsidiaries via the use of cross currency swaps and the designation of our 225 senior notes of €500 million aggregate principal amount due march 2023 as a net investment hedge accordingly we estimate that a 10 movement of the us dollar to various foreign currency exchange rates we translate from in aggregate would not have a material economic impact on our financial position and results of operations 

effective july 1 2018 argentina was determined to be a highly inflationary economy and as such we evaluated the impact of revaluing our monetary assets and liabilities under the applicable guidance and do not expect it to have a material impact 

interest rate risk 

as of december 31 2018  our longterm debt portfolio is primarily comprised of four series of fixedrate senior notes that total 21 billion the senior notes are not exposed to interest rate risk as the bonds are at a fixed rate until maturity based on current interest rate market we do not anticipate material risk associated with our debt refinancing within the target time frame of completion

our industry 

our planet faces serious water challenges less than 1 of the total water available on earth is fresh water and these supplies are under threat due to factors such as the draining of aquifers increased pollution and the effects of climate change demand for fresh water is rising rapidly due to population growth industrial expansion and increased agricultural development with consumption estimated to double every 20 years by 2025 more than 30 of the world’s population is expected to live in areas without adequate water supply even in developed countries with sufficient clean water supply existing infrastructure for water supply is aging and inadequately funded in the united states deteriorating pipe systems theft or inaccurate meters result in approximately one out of every six gallons of water being lost between the treatment plant and the end customer this problem of nonrevenue water is a major financial challenge of many utilities globally especially in developing markets where nonrevenue water can represent 15 to 60 or more of net water produced these and other challenges create opportunities for growth in the global water industry we estimate the total addressable market size to be approximately 550 billion  

we compete in areas that are pivotal to improving water productivity water quality and resilience water productivity refers to the more efficient delivery and use of clean water water quality refers to the efficient and effective management of wastewater resilience refers to the management of waterrelated risks and the resilience of water infrastructure our customers often face all three of these challenges ranging from inefficient and aging water distribution networks which require increases in “water productivity” energyintensive or unreliable wastewater management systems which require increases in “water quality” or exposure to natural disasters such as floods or droughts which require increases in “resilience” additionally through the 2016 acquisition of sensus we also provide solutions to enhance efficiency improve safety and conserve resources to customers in the electric gas and lighting sectors delivering value in these areas creates significant opportunity for the company we estimate our total served market size to be approximately 54 billion 

the global water industry value chain 

the water industry value chain includes equipment and services companies like xylem which address the unique challenges and demands of a diverse customer base this customer base includes utilities that supply water through an infrastructure network and engineering procurement and construction or epc firms which work with utilities to design and build water and wastewater infrastructure networks as depicted below utilities and epc customers are looking for technology and application expertise from their equipment and services providers to address trends such as rising pollution stricter regulations and the increased outsourcing of process knowledge in addition to utilities and epc customers equipment and service providers also provide distinct technologies to a wide array of entities including farms mines power plants industrial facilities and residential and commercial customers seeking to address similar trends 

water industry supply chain 

business strategy 

our strategy is to enhance shareholder value by providing distinctive solutions for our customers most important water productivity quality and resilience challenges enabling us to grow revenue organically and through strategic acquisitions as we streamline our cost structure key elements of our strategy are summarized below 

 

business segments distribution and competitive landscape 

we have t hree reportable business segments that are aligned around the critical market applications they provide water infrastructure applied water and measurement  control solutions see note 20  “segment and 

geographic data” in our consolidated financial statements for financial information about segments and geographic areas 

the table and descriptions below provide an overview of our business segments 

water infrastructure 

our water infrastructure segment supports the process that collects water from a source treats it and distributes it to users and then treats and returns the wastewater responsibly to the environment through two closely linked applications transport and treatment  the transport application also includes sales and rental of specialty dewatering pumps and related equipment and services which provide the safe removal or draining of groundwater and surface water from a riverbed construction or other industrial sites and bypass pumping for the repair of aging public utility infrastructure as well as emergency water removal during severe weather events 

the customer base consists of two primary end markets water utility and industrial the water utility market includes public private and publicprivate entities that support water and wastewater networks the industrial market includes customers who require similar water and wastewater infrastructure networks to support various industrial operations 

water infrastructure provides the majority of its sales through direct channels with remaining sales through indirect channels and service capabilities both water utility and industrial facility customers increasingly require our teams’ global but locally proficient expertise to use our equipment in their specific applications several trends are increasing demand for this application expertise i the increase in both the type and amount of contaminants found in the water supply ii increasing environmental regulations iii the need to increase system efficiencies to optimize energy costs iv the retirement of a largely aging water industry workforce that has not been systematically replaced at utilities and other enduser customers and v the buildout of water infrastructure in the emerging markets we estimate our served market size in this sector to be approximately 17 billion 

given the highly fragmented nature of the water industry the water infrastructure segment competes with a large number of businesses we differentiate ourselves in the market by focusing on product performance reliability 

and innovation application expertise brand reputation energy efficiency product lifecycle cost timeliness of delivery proximity of service centers effectiveness of our distribution channels and price in the sale or rental of products and provision of services we benefit from our large installed base which requires maintenance repair and replacement parts due to the critical application and nature of the products and the conditions under which they operate timeliness of delivery quality and the proximity of service centers are important customer considerations when selecting a provider for aftermarket products and services as well as equipment rentals in geographic regions where we are locally positioned to provide a quick response customers have historically relied on us rather than our competitors for aftermarket products relating to our highly engineered and customized solutions our key competitors within the water infrastructure segment include ksb inc sulzer ltd evoqua water technologies united rentals and danaher corporation

supply and seasonality 

we have a global manufacturing footprint with production facilities in europe north america latin america and asia our inventory management and distribution practices seek to minimize inventory holding periods by striving to take delivery of the inventory and manufacturing as close as possible to the sale or distribution of products to our customers all of our businesses require various parts and raw materials of which the availability and prices may fluctuate parts and raw materials commonly used in our products include motors fabricated parts castings bearings seals nickel copper batteries aluminum plastics pcbs and electronic components while we may recover some cost increases through operational improvements we are still exposed to some pricing risk including increased pricing risk due to proposed duty and tariff assessments by the united states on foreign imports we attempt to control costs through fixedpriced contracts with suppliers and various other programs such as our global procurement initiative 

our business relies on thirdparty suppliers contract manufacturing and commodity markets to secure raw materials parts and components used in our products we typically acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our materials requirements for many of our products we have existing alternate sources of supply or such sources are readily available 

we may experience price volatility or supply constraints for materials that are not available from multiple sources from time to time we acquire certain inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longerterm pricing commitments with vendors to improve the priority price and availability of supply there have been no raw material shortages in the past several years that have had a significant adverse impact on our business as a whole 

our business segments experience a modest level of seasonality in their business this seasonality is dependent on factors such as capital spending of customers as well as weather conditions including heavy flooding droughts and fluctuations in temperatures which can positively or negatively impact portions of our business 

customers 

our business is not dependent on any single customer or a few customers the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our company no individual customer accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated 2017  2016 or 2015 revenue 

backlog 

backlog includes orders on hand as well as contractual customer agreements at the end of the period delivery schedules vary from customer to customer based on their requirements annual or multiyear contracts are subject to rescheduling and cancellation by customers due to the longterm nature of the contracts as such beginning total backlog plus orders minus revenues will not equal ending total backlog due to contract adjustments foreign currency fluctuations and other factors typically large projects require longer lead production cycles and deployment schedules and delays can occur from time to time total backlog was 1513 million at december 31 2017 and 1292 million at december 31 2016  the december 31 2016 backlog balance has been revised to include contractual agreements that sensus has with customers that do not have minimum commitments but which we believe will be executed upon over the terms of the contracts we anticipate that over 60 of the backlog at december 31 2017 will be recognized as revenue during 2018  

research and development 

research and development “rd” is a key foundation of our growth strategy and we focus on the design and development of products and application knowhow that anticipate customer needs and emerging trends our engineers are involved in new product development as well as improvement of existing products to increase customer value our businesses invest substantial resources into rd we anticipate we will continue to develop and invest in our rd capabilities to promote a steady flow of innovative highquality and reliable products and applications to further strengthen our position in the markets we serve we continue to increase our rd investments as a percentage of revenue year over year with 38 in 2017 when compared to 29 in 2016 and 26 in 2015 

we have rd and product development capabilities around the world rd activities are initially conducted in our technology centers located in conjunction with some of our major manufacturing facilities to ensure an efficient and robust development process we have several global technical centers and local development teams around the world where we are supporting global needs and accelerating the customization of our products and solutions to local needs in some cases our rd activities are conducted at our piloting and testing facilities and at strategic customer sites these piloting and testing facilities enable us to serve our strategic markets globally 

capitalized software 

we capitalize software developed for sale to external customers which is included within other intangible assets net on our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2017 and 2016 we had net capitalized software for sale to external customers of 89 million and 54 million respectively 

intellectual property 

we generally seek patent protection for those inventions and improvements that we believe will improve our competitive position we believe that our patents and applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and improving our return on research and development investments while we own control or license a significant number of patents trade secrets proprietary information trademarks trade names copyrights and other intellectual property rights which in the aggregate are of material importance to our business management believes that our business as a whole as well as each of our core business segments is not materially dependent on any one intellectual property right or related group of such rights 

patents patent applications and license agreements expire or terminate over time by operation of law in accordance with their terms or otherwise as the portfolio of our patents patent applications and license 

agreements has evolved over time we do not expect the expiration of any specific patent to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

environmental matters and regulation 

our manufacturing operations worldwide are subject to many requirements under environmental laws in the united states the environmental protection agency and similar state agencies administer laws and regulations concerning air emissions water discharges waste disposal environmental remediation and other aspects of environmental protection such environmental laws and regulations in the united states include for example the federal clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act environmental requirements significantly affect our operations we have established an internal program to address compliance with applicable environmental requirements and as a result management believes that we are in substantial compliance with current environmental regulations 

while environmental laws and regulations are subject to change such changes can be difficult to predict reliably and the timing of potential changes is uncertain management does not believe based on current circumstances that compliance costs pursuant to such regulations will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations however the effect of future legislative or regulatory changes could be material to our financial condition or results of operations 

accruals for environmental matters are recorded on a sitebysite basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on current law and existing technologies it can be difficult to estimate reliably the final costs of investigation and remediation due to various factors our accrued liabilities for these environmental matters represent the best estimates related to the investigation and remediation of environmental media such as water soil soil vapor air and structures as well as related legal fees based upon the facts and circumstances as currently known to us these estimates and related accruals are reviewed quarterly and updated for progress of investigation and remediation efforts and changes in facts and legal circumstances liabilities for these environmental expenditures are recorded on an undiscounted basis we do not anticipate these liabilities will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations at december 31 2017  we had estimated and accrued 4 million related to environmental matters

 item 1a risk factors 

in evaluating our business each of the following risks should be carefully considered along with all of the other information in this report and in our other filings with the sec should any of these risks and uncertainties develop into actual events our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

risks related to operational and external factors 

failure to compete successfully in our markets could adversely affect our business 

we offer our products and services in competitive markets we believe the principal points of competition in our markets are product performance reliability and innovation application expertise brand reputation energy efficiency product life cycle cost timeliness of delivery proximity of service centers effectiveness of our distribution channels and price maintaining and improving our competitive position will require successful management of these factors including continued investment by us in manufacturing research and development engineering marketing customer service and support and our distribution networks our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors including our ability to i identify emerging technological trends in our target endmarkets ii develop and maintain competitive products and defend our market share against an everexpanding number of competitors including many new and nontraditional competitors iii enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization of our products iv develop manufacture and bring compelling new products to market quickly and costeffectively and v attract develop and retain individuals with the requisite technical expertise and understanding of customers’ needs to develop new technologies and introduce new products 

we may not be successful in maintaining our competitive position our competitors or third parties from outside of our industry may develop disruptive technologies or products that are superior to our products or may develop more efficient or effective methods of providing products and services or may adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies or evolving customer requirements the failure of our technologies or products to maintain and gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects pricing pressures also could cause us to adjust the prices of certain products to stay competitive which could adversely affect our financial performance failure to continue competing successfully or to win large contracts could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by global economic and financial market conditions 

we compete around the world in various geographic and product markets in 2017  46  26 and 21 of our total revenue was from customers located in the united states western europe and emerging markets respectively we expect revenue from these markets to be significant for the foreseeable future important factors impacting our businesses include the overall strength of these economies and our customers’ confidence in both local and global macroeconomic conditions industrial and federal state local and municipal governmental fiscal and trade policies the strength of the residential and commercial real estate markets interest rates availability of commercial financing for our customers and endusers the availability of funding for our public sector customers and unemployment rates a slowdown or prolonged downturn in our markets could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

economic and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our business 

in 2017  54 of our total revenue was from customers outside the united states with 21 of total revenue generated in emerging markets we expect our sales from international operations and export sales to continue to be a significant portion of our revenue we have placed a particular emphasis on increasing our growth and presence in emerging markets both our sales from international operations and export sales are subject in varying degrees to risks inherent to doing business outside the united states these risks include the following 



 any payment of distributions loans or advances to us by our foreign subsidiaries could be subject to restrictions on or taxation of dividends on repatriation of earnings under applicable local law monetary transfer restrictions and foreign currency exchange regulations in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate in addition to the general risks that we face outside the united states our operations in emerging markets could involve additional uncertainties for us including risks that governments may impose limitations on our ability to repatriate funds governments may impose withholding or other taxes on remittances and other payments to us or the amount of any such taxes may increase an outbreak or escalation of any insurrection or armed conflict may occur governments may seek to nationalize our assets or governments may impose or increase investment barriers or other restrictions affecting our business in addition emerging markets pose other uncertainties including the difficulty of enforcing agreements challenges collecting receivables protection of our intellectual property and other assets pressure on the pricing of our products higher business conduct risks less qualified talent and risks of political instability we cannot predict the impact such events might have on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring and transformation plans and our restructuring may adversely affect our business 

in recent fiscal years we have initiated restructuring realignment and transformation plans in an effort to optimize our cost structure and improve our operational efficiency and effectiveness in 2017 we undertook steps to advance a multiyear effort to transform many of our support functions and related technologies including finance human resources and procurement we may not be able to obtain the cost savings and benefits that were initially anticipated in connection with our restructuring and transformation plans additionally as a result of these plans  we may experience a loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge or inefficiency during transitional periods transformation realignment and restructuring can require a significant amount of management and other employees time and focus which may divert attention from operating and growing our business 

the successful implementation and execution of our restructuring realignment and transformation actions are critical to achieving our expected cost savings as well as effectively competing in the marketplace and positioning us for future growth factors that may impede a successful implementation include the retention of key employees the impact of regulatory matters or matters involving certain third parties selected to assist us and adverse economic market conditions if our restructuring actions are not executed successfully it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position business financial condition and results of operations 

a material disruption to any of our facilities or operations may adversely affect our business  

if our facilities or operations were to be disrupted as a result of a significant equipment failure natural disaster power outage fire explosion terrorism cyberbased attack labor disputes work stoppages or slowdowns adverse weather conditions or other reason our financial performance could be adversely affected as a result of our inability to meet customer demand interruptions could increase our costs and reduce our sales any interruption in capability could require us to make substantial capital expenditures to remedy the situation which could negatively affect our profitability and financial condition any recovery under our insurance policies may not offset the lost sales or increased costs that may be experienced during the disruption of operations which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business could be adversely affected by cyber threats or interruptions in information technology communications networks and operations 

our business operations rely on information technology and communications networks and operations that are vulnerable to damage or disturbance from a variety of sources regardless of protection measures essentially all systems are susceptible to disruption due to failure vandalism denialofservice insider risk computer viruses security breaches natural disasters power outages and other events in addition we have designed products and services that connect to and are part of the “internet of things” while we attempt to provide adequate security measures to safeguard our products from cyber threats the potential for an attack remains a successful attack may result in inappropriate access to our or our customers information or an inability for our products to function properly 

we and some of our third party vendors have experienced cybersecurity attacks in the past and may experience them in the future likely with more frequency and involving a broader range of devices to date none have resulted in any material adverse impact to our business or operations we have adopted measures designed to mitigate potential risks associated with information technology disruptions and cybersecurity threats however given the unpredictability of the timing nature and scope of such disruptions we could potentially be subject to production downtimes operational delays other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information destruction or corruption of data security breaches other manipulation or improper use of our systems or networks financial losses from remedial actions loss of business or potential liability regulatory enforcement actions andor damage to our reputation any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition we also have or operate through a concentration of operations on certain sites such as production and shared services centers where business interruptions could cause material damage and costs transport of goods from suppliers and to customers could also be hampered for the reasons stated above 

additionally to conduct our operations we regularly move data across national borders and consequently are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in the united states and abroad regarding privacy data protection and data security the scope of the laws that may be applicable to us is often uncertain and may be conflicting particularly with respect to foreign laws for example the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” which greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of european union law and adds a broad array of requirements for handling personal data including the public disclosure of significant data breaches becomes effective in may 2018 and other countries have enacted or are enacting data localization laws that require data to stay within their borders all of these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time 

although we continue to assess these risks implement controls and perform business continuity and disaster recovery planning we cannot be sure that interruptions with material adverse effects will not occur 

our strategy includes acquisitions and we may not be able to make acquisitions of suitable candidates or integrate acquisitions successfully 

as part of our growth strategy we plan to pursue the acquisition of other companies assets and product lines that either complement or expand our existing business we may not be able to identify suitable candidates successfully negotiate appropriate acquisition terms obtain financing that may be needed to consummate those acquisitions complete proposed acquisitions successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or expand into new markets in addition we cannot make assurances that any acquisition once successfully integrated will perform as planned be accretive to earnings or prove to be beneficial to our operations or cash flow 

acquisitions involve a number of risks and present financial managerial and operational challenges including diversion of management attention from existing businesses and operations integration of technology operations personnel and financial and other systems potentially insufficient internal controls over financial activities or financial reporting at an acquired entity that could impact us on a combined basis the failure to realize expected synergies the possibility that we become exposed to substantial undisclosed liabilities or new material risks associated with the acquired businesses and the loss of key employees of the acquired businesses failure to successfully execute our acquisition strategy could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

failure to comply with laws regulations and policies including the us foreign corrupt practices act or other applicable anticorruption legislation could result in fines criminal penalties and an adverse effect on our business 

we are subject to regulation under a wide variety of us federal and state and nonus laws regulations and policies including laws related to anticorruption trade regulations including export and import compliance antitrust and money laundering due to our global operations the us foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa the uk bribery act of 2010 and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from improper conduct of our employees or business partners in the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees or business partners have or may have violated applicable laws including anticorruption laws we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management any such violation could result in substantial fines sanctions civil andor criminal penalties and curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions and might materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition in addition actual or alleged violations could damage our reputation and ability to do business furthermore detecting investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations is expensive and can consume significant time and attention of our senior management 

our business could be adversely affected by significant movements in foreign currency exchange rates 

we conduct approximately 54 of our business in various locations outside the united states we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency transaction exchange rates particularly with respect to the euro swedish krona polish zloty canadian dollar british pound and australian dollar any significant change in the value of currencies of the countries in which we do business relative to the value of the us dollar or euro could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations additionally we are subject to foreign exchange translation risk due to changes in the value of foreign currencies in relation to our reporting currency the us dollar the translation risk is primarily concentrated in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro british pound chinese yuan canadian dollar swedish krona and australian dollar as the us dollar fluctuates against other currencies in which we transact business revenue and income can be impacted for instance our 2017 revenue increased by 09 due to favorable foreign currency impacts strengthening of the us dollar relative to the euro and the currencies of the other countries in which we do business could materially and adversely affect our sales growth in future periods refer to item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information on foreign exchange risk 

failure to retain our existing senior management engineering sales and other key personnel or the inability to attract and retain new qualified personnel could negatively impact our ability to operate or grow our business 

our success will continue to depend to a significant extent on our ability to retain or attract a significant number of employees in senior management engineering sales and other key personnel the ability to attract or retain employees will depend on our ability to offer competitive compensation training and cultural benefits we will need to continue to develop a roster of qualified talent to support business growth and replace departing employees effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution a failure to retain or attract highly skilled personnel could adversely affect our operating results or ability to operate or grow our business 

product defects and unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure with respect to our products could adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements 

manufacturing or design defects in including in products or components that we source from third parties unanticipated use of or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of our products could create product safety regulatory or environmental risks including personal injury death or property damage these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products result in the removal of a product from the market and result in product liability claims being brought against us although we have liability insurance we cannot be certain that 

this insurance coverage will continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost or will be adequate to cover any product liability claims manufacturing design software or service defects or inadequacies may also result in contractual damages or credits being issued which could impact our revenue recalls removals and product liability and quality claims can result in significant costs as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

weather conditions and climate changes may adversely affect or cause volatility in our financial results 

weather conditions including heavy flooding droughts and fluctuations in temperatures or weather patterns including as a result of climate change can positively or negatively impact portions of our business within the dewatering space pumps provided through our godwin and flygt brands are used to remove excess or unwanted water heavy flooding due to weather conditions drives increased demand for these applications on the other hand drought conditions drive higher demand for pumps used in agricultural and turf irrigation applications such as those provided by our goulds water technology and lowara brands fluctuations to warmer and cooler temperatures result in varying levels of demand for products used in residential and commercial applications where homes and buildings are heated and cooled with hvac units such as those provided by our bg brand given the unpredictable nature of weather conditions and climate change this may result in volatility for certain portions of our business as well as the operations of certain of our customers and suppliers 

our financial results can be difficult to predict 

our business is impacted by a substantial amount of short cycle and bookandbill business which we have limited insight into particularly for the business that we transact through our distributors we are also impacted by large projects whose timing can change based upon customer requirements due to a number of factors affecting the project such as funding readiness of the project and regulatory approvals accordingly our financial results for any given period can be difficult to predict 

changes in our effective tax rates may adversely affect our financial results 

we sell our products in approximately 150 countries and 54 of our revenue was generated outside the united states in 2017  given the global nature of our business a number of factors may increase our future effective tax rates including 

 for example compliance with the 2017 united states tax cut and jobs act “tax act” may require the collection of information not regularly produced within our company the use of provisional estimates in our financial statements and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions many aspects of the tax act are unclear and may not be clarified for some time as regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the tax act and as we gather more information and perform more analysis our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our financial position our nonus operations will be subject to alternative tax regimes implemented under the tax act any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could reduce net income for future periods 

our business could be adversely affected by inflation and other manufacturing and operating cost increases 

our operating costs are subject to fluctuations particularly due to changes in commodity prices raw materials energy and related utilities freight and cost of labor in order to remain competitive we may not be able to recuperate all or a portion of these higher costs from our customers through product price increases further in a declining price environment our operating margins may contract because we account for inventory using the firstin first out method actions we take to mitigate volatility in manufacturing and operating costs may not be successful and as a result our business financial condition and results of operation could be materially and adversely affected 

our business could be adversely affected by the inability of suppliers to meet delivery requirements 

our business relies on thirdparty suppliers contract manufacturing and commodity markets to secure raw materials parts and components used in our products and we expect that reliance to increase parts and raw materials commonly used in our products include motors fabricated parts castings bearings seals nickel copper 

batteries aluminum and plastics we are exposed to the availability of these materials which may be subject to curtailment or change due to among other things interruptions in production by suppliers labor disputes the impaired financial condition of a particular supplier suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers changes in tariff regimes exchange rates and prevailing price levels ability to meet regulatory requirements weather emergencies or acts of war or terrorism any delay in our suppliers’ abilities to provide us with necessary materials could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers and accordingly could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operational flexibility 

as of december 31 2017  our total outstanding indebtedness was 2200 million as described under “liquidity and capital resources our indebtedness could 

 in addition there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available to us on favorable terms or at all for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness if we incur additional debt or raise equity through the issuance of preferred stock the terms of the debt or preferred stock issued may give the holders rights preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock particularly in the event of liquidation the terms of the debt may also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on our operations than we currently have 

our ability to make scheduled principal payments of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance which may be affected by factors beyond our control if we are unable to service our indebtedness our business financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 

we may be negatively impacted by litigation and regulatory proceedings 

we are subject to various laws ordinances regulations and other requirements of government authorities in foreign countries and in the united states any violation of which could potentially create substantial liability for us and also damage to our reputation changes in laws ordinances regulations or other government policies the nature timing and effect of which are uncertain may significantly increase our expenses and liabilities 

from time to time we are involved in legal proceedings that are incidental to the operation of our businesses these proceedings may seek remedies relating to environmental matters acquisitions or divestitures product liability and personal injury claims privacy employment labor and pension matters and government contract issues and commercial or contractual disputes our acquisition of sensus and technology focused companies has increased our exposure to intellectual property litigation and we expect that this risk will continue to increase as we execute on our innovation and technology priorities 

it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of claims investigations and lawsuits and we could in the future incur judgments fines or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in any particular period additionally we may be required to change or cease operations at one or more facilities if a regulatory agency determines that we have failed to comply with laws regulations or orders applicable to our business 

the global and diverse nature of our operations coupled with the increase in regulation and enforcement in many regions of the globe means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty will arise from time to time in addition subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessments and estimates of loss 

contingencies recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments in excess of our reserves which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

if we do not or cannot adequately protect our intellectual property if third parties infringe our intellectual property rights or if third parties claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights we may suffer competitive injury expend significant resources enforcing our rights or defending against such claims or be prevented from selling products or services 

we own numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others which in aggregate are important to our business the intellectual property rights that we obtain however may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage because they may not be sufficiently broad or may be challenged invalidated circumvented independently developed or designedaround particularly in countries where intellectual property rights laws are not highly developed protected or enforced our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we receive notices from third parties alleging intellectual property infringement or misappropriation any dispute or litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation in addition as a result of such claims of infringement or misappropriation we could lose our rights to critical technology be unable to license critical technology or sell critical products and services be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights or be required to redesign our products at substantial cost any of which could adversely impact our competitive position financial condition and results of operations even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation we may incur significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

a significant portion of our products and offerings in our measurement  control solutions segment are affected by the availability and regulation of radio spectrum and could be affected by interference with the radio spectrum that we use 

a significant portion of the offering in our measurement  control solutions segment use radio spectrum which is subject to government regulation to the extent we introduce new products designed for use in the united states or another country into a new market such products may require significant modification or redesign in order to meet frequency requirements and other regulatory specifications in some countries limitations on frequency availability or the cost of making necessary modifications may preclude us from selling our products in those countries the regulations that govern our use of the radio spectrum may change and the changes may require us to modify our products or seen new partnerships either directly or due to interference caused by new consumer products allowed under the regulations the inability to modify our products to meet such requirements the possible delays in completing such modifications and the cost of such modifications all could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition suitable partners for codevelopment may not be able to be secured by us 

in the united states our products are primarily designed to use licensed spectrum in the 900mhz range if the federal communications commission “fcc” did not renew our existing spectrum licenses our business could be adversely affected in addition there may be insufficient available frequencies in some markets to sustain or develop our planned operations at a commercially feasible price or at all 

outside of the united states certain of our products require the use of radio frequency and are subject to regulations in some jurisdictions radio station licenses may be granted for a fixed term and must be periodically renewed our advanced and smart metering systems offering typically transmit to and receive information from if applicable handheld mobile or fixed network reading devices in licensed bands made available to us through strategic partnerships and are reliant to some extent on the licensed spectrum continuing to be available through our partners or our customers we may be unable to find partners or customers that have access to sufficient frequencies in some markets to sustain or develop our planned operations or to find partners or customers that have access to sufficient frequencies in the relevant markets at a commercially feasible price or at all 

we may incur impairment charges for our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets which would negatively impact our operating results 

we have a significant amount of goodwill and purchased intangible assets on our balance sheet as a result of acquisitions we have completed as of december 31 2017  the net carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets totaled approximately  3 billion  the carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of an acquired business in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date the carrying value of indefinitelived intangible assets represents the fair value of trademarks trade names and fcc licenses as of the acquisition date we do not amortize goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets that we expect to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows but instead we evaluate these assets for impairment at least annually or more frequently if interim indicators suggest that a potential impairment could exist in testing for impairment we will make a qualitative assessment and if we believe that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount a goodwill impairment test is required significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets divestitures and market capitalization declines may impair our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets any charges relating to such impairments could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we cannot make assurances that we will pay dividends on our common stock or continue to repurchase our common stock under board approved share repurchase plans and likewise our indebtedness could limit our ability to pay dividends or make share repurchases 

the timing declaration amount and payment of future dividends to our shareholders fall within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on many factors including our financial condition results of operations and capital requirements as well as applicable law regulatory constraints industry practice and other business considerations that our board of directors considers relevant there can be no assurance that we will pay a dividend in the future or continue to pay dividends 

further the timing and amount of the repurchase of our common stock under board approved share repurchase plans has similar dependencies as the payment of dividends and accordingly there can be no assurances that we will repurchase our common stock 

additionally if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our debt payment obligations then our ability to pay dividends if so determined by the board of directors or make share repurchases will be impaired and we may be required to attempt to restructure or refinance our debt raise additional capital or take other actions such as selling assets reducing or delaying capital expenditures reducing our dividend or delaying or curtailing share repurchases there can be no assurance however that any such actions could be effected on satisfactory terms if at all or would be permitted by the terms of our debt or our other credit and contractual arrangements 

unforeseen environmental issues could impact our financial position or results of operations 

our operations and products and offerings are subject to and affected by many federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations in addition we could be affected by future environmental laws or regulations including for example those imposed in response to climate change concerns compliance with current and future environmental laws and regulations currently requires and is expected to continue to require operating and capital expenditures 

environmental laws and regulations may authorize substantial fines and criminal sanctions as well as facility shutdowns to address violations and may require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit emissions or discharges we also incur and expect to continue to incur costs to comply with current environmental laws and regulations 

developments such as the adoption of new environmental laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations violations by us of such laws and regulations discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination litigation involving environmental impacts our inability to recover costs associated with any such developments or financial insolvency of other responsible parties could in the future have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 

the level of returns on postretirement benefit plan assets changes in interest rates and other factors could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods 

certain members of our current and retired employee population are covered by pension and other employeerelated defined benefit plans collectively postretirement benefit plans we may experience significant fluctuations in costs related to our postretirement benefit plans as a result of macroeconomic factors such as interest rates 

that are beyond our control the cost of our postretirement plans is incurred over long periods of time and involves factors and uncertainties during those periods which can be volatile and unpredictable including rates of return on postretirement benefit plan assets discount rates used to calculate liabilities and expenses and rates of future compensation increases management develops each assumption using relevant plan and company experience and expectations in conjunction with marketrelated data our liquidity financial position including shareholders’ equity and results of operations could be materially affected by significant changes in key economic indicators actuarial experience financial market volatility future legislation and other governmental regulatory actions 

we make contributions to fund our postretirement benefit plans when considered necessary or advantageous to do so the macroeconomic factors discussed above including the return on postretirement benefit plan assets and the minimum funding requirements established by local government funding or taxing authorities or established by other agreement may influence future funding requirements a significant decline in the fair value of our plan assets or other adverse changes to our overall pension and other employeerelated benefit plans could require us to make significant funding contributions and affect cash flows in future periods 

the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly 

we cannot predict the prices at which our common stock may trade the market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely depending on many factors some of which may be beyond our control including 

 stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents and indiana law could delay or prevent a change in control 

certain provisions of our third amended and restated articles of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may delay or prevent a merger or acquisition of part or all of our business operations for example our articles of incorporation and our bylaws among other things require advance notice for shareholder proposals and nominations in addition our articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock these provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals of our business operations or delay or prevent a change in control which could harm our stock price indiana law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 10 or more of our outstanding common stock and us 

in connection with our spinoff itt now itt llc and exelis acquired by harris inc will indemnify us for certain liabilities and we will indemnify itt now itt llc or exelis for certain liabilities if we are required to indemnify itt now itt llc or exelis we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations and our financial results could be negatively impacted in the case of itts or exeliss indemnity there can be no assurance that those indemnities will be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of such liabilities or as to itts or exeliss ability to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future 

pursuant to the distribution agreement and certain other agreements with itt now itt llc and exelis itt now itt llc and exelis agreed to indemnify us from certain liabilities and we agreed to indemnify itt now itt llc and exelis for certain liabilities indemnities that we may be required to provide itt now itt llc and exelis may be significant and could negatively impact our business third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that itt now itt llc or exelis has agreed to retain further there can be no assurance that the indemnities from itt now itt llc and exelis will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities or that itt now itt llc and exelis will be able to fully satisfy their indemnification obligations moreover even if we ultimately were to succeed in recovering from itt now itt llc and exelis any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves each of these risks could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto this discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations and the financial condition of our business during each of the fiscal years in the threeyear period ended december 31 2017  except as otherwise indicated or unless the context otherwise requires “xylem” “we” “us” “our” and “the company” refer to xylem inc and its subsidiaries 

overview 

xylem is a leading global water technology company we design manufacture and service highly engineered solutions ranging across a wide variety of critical applications our broad portfolio of solutions addresses customer needs across the water cycle from the delivery measurement and use of drinking water to the collection test and treatment of wastewater to the return of water to the environment our product and service offerings are organized into three reportable segments that are aligned around the critical market applications they provide water infrastructure applied water and measurement  control solutions formerly sensus  analytics 

as previously announced in the second quarter of 2017 we implemented an organizational redesign by moving xylem’s analytics business from our water infrastructure segment to combine it with our sensus and visenti businesses which were acquired in the fourth quarter of 2016 to form measurement  control solutions we believe that the combination of these businesses will enhance our focus on advanced sensing technologies and will lead to operating efficiencies by integrating the supply chain process and moving to a leaner functional structure accordingly our reportable segments have changed beginning with the second quarter of 2017 the company now reports the financial position and results of operations of its analytics sensus and visenti businesses as one new reportable segment which is called measurement  control solutions our water infrastructure reportable segment no longer includes the results of our analytics business the company has recast certain historical amounts between the companys water infrastructure and measurement  control solutions reportable segments however this change had no impact on the companys historical consolidated financial position or results of operations the recast financial information does not represent a restatement of previously issued financial statements our applied water reportable segment remains unchanged 



key performance indicators and nongaap measures 

management reviews key performance indicators including revenue gross margins segment operating income and margins orders growth working capital and backlog among others in addition we consider certain nongaap or adjusted measures to be useful to management and investors evaluating our operating performance for the periods presented and provide a tool for evaluating our ongoing operations liquidity and management of assets this information can assist investors in assessing our financial performance and measures our ability to generate capital for deployment among competing strategic alternatives and initiatives including but not limited to dividends acquisitions share repurchases and debt repayment excluding revenue xylem provides guidance only on a nongaap basis due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting certain amounts that would be included in gaap earnings such as discrete tax items without unreasonable effort these adjusted metrics are consistent with how management views our business and are used to make financial operating and planning decisions these metrics however are not measures of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered a substitute for revenue operating income net income earnings per share basic and diluted or net cash from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap we consider the following nongaap measures which may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies to be key performance indicators

executive summary 

xylem reported revenue of 4707 million for 2017  an increase of 936 million or 248 from 3771 million reported in 2016  revenue increased 239 on a constant currency basis mostly due to 790 million of revenue related to acquisitions and organic revenue growth of 122 million driven by growth in all end markets 

operating income for 2017 was 556 million  reflecting an increase of 150 million or 369 compared to 406 million in 2016  operating margin was 118 for 2017 versus 108 for 2016 an increase of 100 basis points the increase in operating margin was primarily due to cost reductions resulting from progress in our global procurement and productivity initiatives a decrease in sensus acquisition related costs restructuring savings and a decrease in restructuring and realignment charges these favorable impacts on operating margin were partially offset by cost inflation increases sensus purchase accounting impacts and an increase in special charges 

adjusted operating income was 630 million with an adjusted operating margin of 134 in 2017 as compared to adjusted operating income of 511 million with an adjusted operating margin of 136 in 2016 the decrease in adjusted operating margin was mostly due to cost inflation increases increased spending on strategic investments and sensus purchase accounting impacts which were largely offset by cost savings from our global procurement and productivity initiatives and restructuring savings the noncash sensus purchase accounting impact on adjusted operating margin for the year was 50 basis points which if excluded would bring the adjusted operating margin to 139 a 30 basis point increase over the prior year 

additional financial highlights for 2017 include the following 

 2018 business outlook 

we anticipate total revenue growth in the range of 8 to 10 in 2018 with the recently announced acquisition of pure technologies contributing approximately 2 of that growth organic revenue growth is anticipated to be 4 to 6 the following is a summary of our 2017 organic revenue performance and 2018 organic revenue outlook by end market 



we will continue to strategically execute restructuring and realignment actions primarily to reposition our european and north american businesses in an effort to optimize our cost structure and improve our operational efficiency and effectiveness during 2017 we incurred 20 million and 21 million in restructuring and realignment costs respectively as a result of these actions in 2017 we realized 6 million of net savings and expect to realize approximately 10 million of incremental net savings in 2018 we expect additional incremental savings to be realized in 2019 and beyond as we complete these actions during 2018 we currently expect to incur approximately 35 million in restructuring realignment and integration costs 

we plan to continue to take actions and focus spending in 2018 on actions that allow us to make progress on our top strategic priorities the priority of accelerating profitable growth encompass our initiatives to drive commercial excellence grow in emerging markets and strengthen innovation and technology through creation of new centers of excellence a streamlined approach to product development and smart acquisitions the priority of driving continuous improvement is an area where we will continue to work to create new opportunities to unlock savings by eliminating waste and increasing efficiencies which is supported by efforts to expand and further deepen our talent pool we plan to continue to deploy capital in smart disciplined ways to develop and acquire solutions to address our customers’ challenges finally we continue to work to improve cash performance and generate capital to return to our shareholders

2017 versus 2016 

revenue 

revenue generated for 2017 was 4707 million  an increase of 936 million  or 248  compared to 3771 million in 2016  on a constant currency basis revenue grew 239  this increase in revenue was primarily driven by additional revenue of 790 million from acquisitions there was also strong organic growth of 122 million during the year driven primarily by north america as well as strength in the emerging markets particularly in china and india additionally to a lesser extent europe contributed to this organic growth despite ongoing weakness in the united kingdom during the year 

the following table illustrates the impact on 2017 revenue from organic growth recent acquisitions and divestitures and foreign currency translation in relation to revenue 



 

water infrastructure 

water infrastructure’s revenue increased 72 million  or 37  in 2017 29 increase on a constant currency basis compared to 2016  revenue benefited from 16 million of foreign currency translation for the year and included organic growth of 56 million  or 29  

organic growth for the year was driven by strength in the industrial end market and to a lesser extent in the public utility end market the growth in both of these end markets was driven by strength from asia pacific and north america 

from an application perspective organic revenue growth was driven primarily by our transport application the transport application grew in the industrial end market due to strength in the dewatering business which benefited from the recovery of the industrial construction market particularly within the distribution channel and recovery of oil and gas and mining markets in north america and latin america the transport application also grew in the public utility end market driven by increased municipal spending in north america and increased projects in the middle east and india organic revenue from our treatment application also contributed to the segments growth primarily from growth in china from industrial treatment project deliveries as well as growth in europe from municipal treatment projects 

applied water 

applied water’s revenue increased 28 million  or 20  in 2017  17 increase on a constant currency basis compared to 2016 revenue benefited from 4 million of foreign currency translation for the year and the constant currency increase included organic growth of 34 million  or 24  

organic growth for the year was driven by strength in the residential and commercial end markets in the united states asia pacific and western europe which were partially offset by declines in the industrial market 

from an application perspective growth in residential building services was primarily driven by strength in the united states where we benefited from the timing of promotions and market share gains and continued strength in asia pacific commercial building services also grew primarily in north america western europe and asia pacific driven by new product traction and sales channel investments this growth was partially offset by a decline in industrial applications primarily driven by unfavorable weather conditions impacting the agriculture business in the united states partially offset by strength in western europe 

measurement  control solutions 

measurement  control solutions revenue increased 836 million or 1874 in 2017 1843 on a constant currency basis compared to 2016 the revenue increase for the year was almost entirely from 790 million of revenue related to acquisitions that we did not have in the prior year most of the additional revenue contributed by the sensus business was generated in the united states with additional revenue coming primarily from western europe and china the majority of the sensus business revenue came from water applications with gas and electric applications making up most of the remaining sales for the year organic revenue growth in the measurement  control solutions segment was 32 million or 72 for the year organic growth was driven primarily by growth across all applications except electric which had slight declines much of the organic revenue increase was in the water application which had increased ami deployments in north america as well as higher demand for iperl product in eastern europe and the middle east organic revenue also increased in the gas application primarily due to ami deployments in north america as well as in the software and services application primarily driven by a couple of major contract upgrades the test application also contributed to the increase in organic revenue as a result of strength from the environmental monitoring business in the united states 

ordersbacklog 

orders received during 2017 increased by 1044 million  or 273  to  4868 million  264 increase on a constant currency basis the order growth on a constant currency basis was primarily driven by additional orders from recent acquisitions primarily sensus of 762 million organic order growth was 260 million  or 68  over the prior year 

water infrastructure segment orders increased 155 million  or 79  to 2112 million  71 growth on a constant currency basis orders benefited from 16 million of foreign currency translation for the year and included organic growth of 139 million or 71 the majority of the organic order growth for the segment came from the transport application driven by the public utility sector in the united states as well as strong project orders in china and india additionally dewatering distributor orders increased driven by storm related activity and the strengthening of the oil and gas markets treatment applications also had strong order intake primarily from projects in the emerging markets latin america and north america 

orders increased in our applied water segment by 71 million  or 51  to 1476 million  48 increase on a constant currency basis the order increase was primarily due to organic order growth of 79 million or 56  driven by strength in the emerging markets and strong commercial building and industrial performance in north america which was partially offset by the loss of orders related to divested businesses of 11 million 

orders increased in our measurement  control solutions segment by 818 million or 1771 to 1280 million 174 growth on a constant currency basis this increase included orders from recent acquisitions primarily sensus of 762 million and organic order growth of 42 million or 91 primarily from sensus order increases in north america for most applications as well as increased orders from test application strength in the united states and china 

backlog includes contractual customer commitments as well as orders on hand as of the end of the period delivery schedules vary from customer to customer based upon their requirements annual or multiyear contracts are subject to rescheduling and cancellation by customers due to the longterm nature of the contracts as such beginning total backlog plus orders minus revenues will not equal ending total backlog due to contract adjustments foreign currency fluctuations and other factors typically large projects require longer lead production cycles and deployment schedules and delays can occur from time to time total backlog was 1513 million at december 31 2017 and 1292 million at december 31 2016  an increase of 17 the december 31 2016 backlog balance has been revised to include contractual agreements that sensus has with customers that do not have minimum commitments but which we believe will be executed upon over the terms of the contracts this year over year increase in backlog of 221 million is due to strong order growth in the fourth quarter across all of our segments as well as benefits from currency translation impacts we anticipate that over 60 of our total backlog at december 31 2017 will be recognized as revenue during 2018  

gross margin 

gross margins as a percentage of consolidated revenue increased to 393 in 2017 from 387 in 2016  the gross margin increase was primarily due to the benefits realized from cost reductions from global procurement and continuous improvement initiatives as well as a decrease in the inventory stepup charge for sensus in 2017 these positive impacts on gross margin were partially offset by cost inflation and unfavorable product mix 

operating expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses 

sga increased by 175 million increase of 191  to 232 of revenue in 2017  as compared to 243 of revenue in 2016  the increase in sga expenses includes approximately 160 million of incremental sga spending for the sensus business that we did not have prior to the acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2016 the remaining increases in sga expenses were primarily due to inflation investments in regional sales channels and operational capabilities and foreign currency impacts which were partially offset by savings from restructuring and other cost actions 

research and development expenses 

rd spending increased 70 million or 636 to 38 of revenue in 2017 as compared to 29 of revenue in 2016 primarily due to additional rd spend from our recent acquisitions and investments in new products and technologies 

restructuring charges and asset impairment 

restructuring charges 

during 2017  we incurred restructuring costs of 7 million  8 million and 5 million in our water infrastructure applied water and measurement  control solutions segments respectively we incurred these charges related to actions taken in 2017 primarily as a continuation of our efforts to reposition our european and north american businesses to optimize our cost structure and improve our operational efficiency and effectiveness the charges included the reduction of headcount and consolidation of facilities within our applied water and water infrastructure segments as well as headcount reductions within our measurement  control solutions segment 

during 2016  we recognized restructuring costs of 12 million 10 million 6 million and 2 million in our water infrastructure applied water measurement  control solutions and corporate respectively these charges were incurred primarily in an effort to realign our organizational structure in europe and north america to optimize our cost structure the charges relate to the reduction in structural costs including a decrease in headcount and consolidation of facilities 

the following table presents expected restructuring spend 



the water infrastructure applied water measurement  control solutions and corporate actions commenced in 2017 consist primarily of severance charges and are expected to continue through the end of 2018 the water infrastructure applied water measurement  control solutions and corporate actions commenced in 2016 consist primarily of severance charges and are largely complete the water infrastructure applied water and measurement  control solutions actions commenced in 2015 consist primarily of severance charges and are complete as a result of these actions initiated in 2017 we achieved savings of approximately 4 million in 2017 and estimate annual future net savings beginning in 2018 of approximately 9 million resulting in 5 million of incremental savings from the 2017 actions 

asset impairment charges 

during the first quarter of 2017 we determined that certain assets within our applied water segment including a tradename were impaired accordingly we recognized an impairment charge of 5 million refer to note 10 goodwill and other intangible assets for additional information 

operating income 

we generated operating income of 556 million operating margin of 118 during 2017  reflecting an increase of 150 million  or 369  when compared to operating income of  406 million operating margin of 108 during the prior year this increase in operating income was largely driven by the inclusion of sensus operating income for the 

full year in 2017 sensus acquisition related costs and restructuring and realignment costs decreased 31 million and 6 million respectively while special charges increased 6 million when compared to the prior year period excluding these costs adjusted operating income was 630 million adjusted operating margin of 134 for 2017 as compared to 511 million adjusted operating margin of 136 for 2016 the decrease in adjusted operating margin was mostly due to cost inflation increases increased spending on strategic investments and sensus purchase accounting impacts which were largely offset by cost savings from our global procurement and productivity initiatives and restructuring savings the noncash sensus purchase accounting impact on adjusted operating margin for the year was 50 basis points 

the table below provides a reconciliation of total and each segments operating income to adjusted operating income and a calculation of the corresponding adjusted operating margin 



nm not meaningful 

water infrastructure 

operating income for our water infrastructure segment increased 17 million  or 58  with operating margin also increasing from 151 to 154  a 30 basis point increase as compared to the prior year operating margin was positively impacted year over year by special charges of 2 million in 2016 that did not recur while restructuring and realignment costs remained flat excluding these items adjusted operating income increased 15 million  or 49  with adjusted operating margin increasing from 160 to 162  a 20 basis point increase as compared to the prior year the increase in adjusted operating margin was primarily due to cost reductions from global procurement and continuous improvement initiatives as well as restructuring savings and favorable volume these drivers were partially offset by increases in cost inflation and spending on strategic investments as well as unfavorable transactional foreign currency impacts 

applied water 

operating income for our applied water segment increased 9 million  or 48  with operating margin also increasing from 135 to 139  a 40 basis point increase as compared to the prior year operating margin was negatively impacted by higher special charges for a noncash impairment of 5 million and a 1 million increase in restructuring and realignment costs excluding these items adjusted operating income increased 15 million  or 74  with adjusted operating margin increasing from 146 to 154  an 80 basis point increase as compared to the prior year the increase in adjusted operating margin was primarily due to cost reductions from global procurement and continuous improvement initiatives and restructuring savings which were partially offset by increases in cost inflation and unfavorable mix 

measurement  control solutions 

operating income for our measurement  control solutions segment increased 110 million operating margin of 86 for the year as compared to operating income and margin of zero in 2016 operating margin was positively impacted by decreases in sensus acquisition related costs restructuring and realignment costs and special charges of 10 million 5 million and 3 million respectively excluding these items adjusted operating income increased 92 million or 2244 with most of the increase coming from the inclusion of the incremental adjusted operating income for sensus in 2017 adjusted operating margin increased from 92 to 104 a 120 basis point increase as compared to the prior year the increase in adjusted operating margin was primarily due to cost reductions from global procurement and continuous improvement initiatives restructuring savings and favorable volume impacts these drivers were partially offset by the inclusion of sensus margins which were negatively impacted by purchase accounting noncash sensus purchase accounting negatively impacted the segments full year adjusted operating margin by 200 basis points 

corporate and other 

operating expense for corporate and other decreased 14 million  or 192  compared to the prior year primarily due to a 21 million decrease in sensus acquisition related costs and a 2 million decrease in restructuring and realignment costs this was partially offset by 6 million of special charges incurred during the year which we did not have in the prior year excluding these costs adjusted operating expense increased 3 million compared to the prior year driven mostly by employee related costs 

interest expense 

interest expense was 82 million and 70 million for 2017 and 2016  respectively the increased interest expense for the the year includes additional interest expense in 2017 related to debt entered into in the fourth quarter of 2016 to fund our acquisition of sensus the increase in interest expense was partially offset by the reduction in special interest charges incurred in 2016 of 8 million in connection with the early extinguishment of our senior notes due in 2016 and 5 million of financing charges on the bridge loan related to the sensus acquisition neither of which recurred in 2017 as well as a lower interest rate on the senior notes due 2023 which effectively replaced the senior notes due in 2016 see note 13 credit facilities and debt of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our credit facilities and longterm debt and related interest

the income tax provision for 2017 was 136 million at an effective tax rate of 292 compared to 80 million at an effective tax rate of 235 in 2016  the 2017 effective tax rate is higher than 2016 due to the provisional one time deemed repatriation transition tax under the newly enacted tax cuts and jobs act partially offset by the benefit from the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities and the release of valuation allowances 

tax act 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” the tax act makes broad and complex changes to the us tax code including but not limited to 1 reducing the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent 2 requiring companies to pay a onetime transition tax on certain unrepatriated foreign earnings of foreign subsidiaries 3 generally eliminating us federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries 4 requiring a current inclusion in us federal taxable income of certain earnings of controlled foreign corporations 5 eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax amt and changing how existing amt credits can be realized 6 creating the base erosion antiabuse tax beat a new minimum tax 7 creating a new limitation on deductible interest expense and 8 changing rules related to uses and limitations of net operating loss carryforwards created in tax years beginning after december 31 2017 

in connection with our initial analysis of the impact of the tax act we have recorded a provisional tax expense of 46 million as a discrete item this net income tax expense primarily consists of a tax benefit for the corporate tax rate reduction of 107 million related to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities and a tax expense for the repatriation transition tax of 153 million as permitted under sab 118 we have not completed our accounting for the income tax effects of certain elements of the tax act and have recorded provisional estimates related to these items for certain items a provisional estimate could not be determined and therefore we have continued accounting for them in accordance with asc 740 on the basis of the tax laws in effect before the tax act see note 6 income taxes of our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the tax act 

other comprehensive income 

other comprehensive income was 108 million in 2017 as compared to an 80 million loss in 2016  this increase was driven primarily by favorable foreign currency translation impacts primarily due to the strengthening of the euro great british pound chinese yuan polish zloty amongst other various currencies against the us dollar as compared to the weakening of these same currencies in the prior year partially offsetting these favorable movements was the euro movement on the companys net investment hedge as compared to the prior year the tax impact on the foreign currency translation related to the net investment hedge also contributed to the year over year increase finally year over year movement in foreign currency translation on postretirement benefit plans partially offset the increase in other comprehensive income 

2016 versus 2015 

revenue 

revenue generated for 2016 was 3771 million an increase of 118 million or 32 compared to 3653 million in 2015 on a constant currency basis revenue grew 53 this increase in revenue was primarily driven by additional revenue of 163 million from acquisitions additionally we had strong organic growth driven by strength within the public utility industrial and commercial end markets in western europe particularly in the united kingdom as well as large project deliveries in emerging markets including india and asia partially offsetting this growth were declines in the united states primarily due to ongoing weakness in the industrial end market 

the following table illustrates the impact on 2016 revenue from organic growth recent acquisitionsdivestitures and foreign currency translation in relation to revenue 





water infrastructure 

water infrastructure’s revenue decreased 8 million or 04 in 2016 23 increase on a constant currency basis compared to 2015 the constant currency increase included organic growth of 44 million or 23 

organic growth in our treatment and transport applications primarily reflect increases in the public utility end market where we have been gaining share organic growth in the transport application in the public utility end markets in the united states and india was largely offset by declines in the industrial dewatering business in the united states due to continued challenges in the oil and gas market as well as weakness in the middle east driven by slower government funding organic growth in the treatment application was driven primarily by strong backlog execution and project deliveries in the united states public utility market 

applied water 

applied water’s revenue decreased 29 million or 20 in 2016 06 decrease on a constant currency basis compared to 2015 the decline on a constant currency basis was entirely attributable to organic revenue decline of 9 million or 06 which was driven by declines in the united states partially offset by growth in western europe and to a lesser extent the emerging markets 

from an applications perspective the decrease in organic revenue was predominately due to declines in the united states across all applications particularly industrial water which saw continued weakness in the oil and gas markets these declines were partially offset by strength in western europe due to several large projects combined with strength in commercial building services as well as general industrial applications agricultural applications declined in the united states primarily due to market weakness 

measurement  control solutions 

measurement  control solutions revenue increased 155 million or 533 in 2016 540 increase on a constant currency basis compared to 2015 the constant currency increase included contributions from acquisitions of 163 million which was partially offset by an organic decline of 6 million or 21 due to weakness from test applications in the united states primarily as a result of lower government agency spending and weakness in the mining and oil and gas markets 

ordersbacklog 

orders received during 2016 increased by 113 million or 30 to 3824 million 51 increase on a constant currency basis the order growth on a constant currency basis was primarily made up of orders from recent acquisitions primarily sensus of 179 million and organic order growth of 12 million or 03 over the prior year 

water infrastructure segment orders decreased 52 million or 26 to 1957 million 01 growth on a constant currency basis orders were unfavorably impacted by 55 million from foreign currency translation while orders were up slightly year over year on an organic basis organic orders for the treatment application increased by 5 over the prior year reflecting continued growth in the public utility market with a large ozone project in china and order increases in europe however these orders are largely project based with longer lead times for delivery and recognition of revenue largely offsetting the organic order growth in the treatment application were declines in the transport application primarily due to decreased dewatering orders impacted by the continued weakness in oil and gas as well as mining which were partially offset by public utility water and wastewater transport order strength in europe particularly in the nordic region 

orders decreased in our applied water segment by 10 million or 07 to 1405 million 07 increase on a constant currency basis the order increase on a constant currency basis was due to organic order growth of 07 driven by strength in europe from new product launches that was partially offset by weakness in the united states 

the measurement  control solutions segment orders increased 175 million or 610 to 462 620 increase on a constant currency basis the order growth on a constant currency basis was primarily orders from recent acquisitions of 179 million organic orders from test applications were flat versus the prior year 

backlog includes contractual customer commitments as well as purchase orders on hand as of the end of the period delivery schedules vary from customer to customer based upon their requirements annual or multiyear contracts are subject to rescheduling and cancellation by customers due to the longterm nature of the contracts as such beginning total backlog plus orders minus revenues will not equal ending total backlog due to contract adjustments foreign currency fluctuations and other factors typically large projects require longer lead production cycles and delays can occur from time to time total backlog was 1292 million at december 31 2016 and 716 million at december 31 2015 the december 31 2016 backlog balance has been revised to include contractual agreements that sensus has with customers that do not have minimum commitments but which we believe will be 

executed upon over the terms of the contracts this increase is primarily attributable to the acquisition of the sensus business which had a backlog balance of 599 million at december 31 2016 

gross margin 

gross margins as a percentage of consolidated revenue increased to 387 in 2016 from 384 in 2015 the gross margin increase was primarily due to the benefits realized from cost saving initiatives through global sourcing and lean six sigma partially offset by material and labor inflation headwinds and unfavorable currency impacts and mix 

operating expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses 

sga increased by 61 million increase of 71 to 243 of revenue in 2016 as compared to 234 of revenue in 2015 the increase in sga expenses includes 28 million of sensus acquisition related costs the remaining increases in sga expenses were primarily due to additional operating expenses from recent acquisitions investments in regional sales channels and operational capabilities and inflation which were partially offset by savings from restructuring and other cost actions 

research and development expenses 

rd spending increased 15 million or 158 to 29 of revenue in 2016 as compared to 26 of revenue in 2015 primarily due to additional rd spend from our recent acquisitions and investments in new products and technologies 

restructuring charges 

during 2016 we incurred restructuring costs of 12 million 10 million 6 million and 2 million in our water infrastructure applied water measurement  control solutions and corporate and other segments respectively these charges were incurred primarily in an effort to realign our organizational structure in europe and north america to optimize our cost structure the charges relate to the reduction in structural costs including a decrease in headcount and consolidation of facilities 

during 2015 we recognized restructuring costs of 4 million 1 million and 1 million in our water infrastructure applied water and monitoring  control solutions segments respectively these charges were incurred primarily in an effort to realign our organizational structure in europe and north america to optimize our cost structure the charges relate to the reduction in structural costs including a decrease in headcount and consolidation of facilities 

the following table presents expected restructuring spend 



approximate total expected costs associated with actions that commenced during 2016 are 13 million for water infrastructure 14 million for applied water 10 million for measurement  control solutions and 2 million for corporate these costs primarily comprise severance charges the water infrastructure and applied water actions are expected to continue through the end of 2017 the measurement  control solutions actions are expected to continue through 2018 all of the costs associated with the corporate actions have been incurred as a result of these actions initiated in 2016 we achieved savings of approximately 8 million in 2016 and estimate annual future net savings beginning in 2017 of approximately 28 million resulting in 20 million of incremental savings from the 2016 actions 

operating income 

we generated operating income of 406 million during 2016 reflecting a decrease of 43 million or 96 from 449 million during the prior year operating income as a percentage of revenue was 108 for 2016 versus 123 for 2015 a decrease of 150 basis points this decrease in operating margin was primarily due to sensus acquisition related costs of 53 million increases in restructuring and realignment costs of 27 million and increases in special charges of 4 million excluding these costs adjusted operating income was 511 million with an adjusted operating margin of 136 reflecting an increase of 41 million or 87 and 70 basis points respectively as compared with 2015 adjusted operating income of 470 million adjusted operating margin of 129 this increase in adjusted operating income was driven by strong progress in our productivity initiatives and cost saving actions which more than offset cost inflation spending on strategic investments in new products and technologies and unfavorable mix 

the table below provides a reconciliation of the total and each segments operating income to adjusted operating income and a calculation of the corresponding adjusted operating margin 

nm not meaningful 

water infrastructure 

operating income for our water infrastructure segment increased 30 million or 115 with operating margin also increasing from 135 to 151 a 160 basis point increase as compared to the prior year operating margin was negatively impacted by a 5 million increase in restructuring and realignment costs and a 1 million increase for special charges excluding restructuring and realignment costs and special charges adjusted operating income increased 36 million or 132 with adjusted operating margin increasing from 141 to 160 a 190 basis point increase as compared to the prior year the increase in adjusted operating margin was due to global procurement and continuous improvement initiatives which more than offset cost inflation and increased spending in growth initiatives 

applied water 

operating income for our applied water segment decreased 2 million or 11 with operating margin increasing slightly from 134 to 135 operating margin was negatively impacted by increased restructuring and realignment costs of 9 million excluding restructuring and realignment costs adjusted operating income increased 7 million or 36 with adjusted operating margin increasing from 139 to 146 a 60 basis point increase as compared to the prior year the increase in adjusted operating margin was due to global procurement and productivity gains which more than offset cost inflation strategic investments and unfavorable mix 

measurement  control solutions 

operating income for our measurement  control solutions segment was 0 million a decrease of 42 million operating income was negatively impacted by 25 million of sensus acquisition related costs in 2016 and increases in restructuring and realignment and special charges of 11 million and 3 million respectively excluding these costs adjusted operating income decreased 3 million or 68 with adjusted operating margin decreasing from 151 to 92 a 590 basis point decrease as compared to the prior year the decrease in operating margin was largely due to negative impacts from acquisitions as well as increased spending on strategic investments 

corporate and other 

operating loss for corporate and other increased 29 million or 659 decreased 1 million or 23 on an adjusted basis compared to the prior year primarily due to 28 million of sensus acquisition related costs and increased restructuring costs of 2 million 

interest expense 

interest expense was 70 million and 55 million for 2016 and 2015 respectively primarily related to interest on our senior notes including a makewhole interest premium of 7 million that was paid in the second quarter of 2016 and fees of 5 million related to the bridge facility entered into for the sensus acquisition see note 13 “credit facilities and longterm debt” for further details 

income tax expense 

the income tax provision for 2016 was 80 million at an effective tax rate of 235 compared to 63 million at an effective tax rate of 156 in 2015 the 2016 effective tax rate is higher than 2015 due to an increase in valuation allowance and impact of repatriation of foreign earnings offset by a favorable settlement with the tax authorities 

other comprehensive loss income 

other comprehensive loss before tax of 57 million in 2016 as compared to 130 million loss in 2015 was primarily due to foreign currency translation loss of 65 million in 2016 compared to a loss of 180 million for 2015 contributing to this decreased loss was a lower translation loss of 115 million primarily due to less weakening of the swedish krona and the canadian dollar against the us dollar partially offset by the additional weakening of the euro and the great british pound against the us dollar additionally there were net investment hedges in place that more than offset the weakening of the euro against the us dollar contributing a net euro gain into comprehensive income in 2016 other items offsetting the lower translation loss of 115 million were net changes in postretirement benefit plan gainslosses of 43 million 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash 

 sources and uses of liquidity 

operating activities 

during 2017  net cash provided by operating activities was 686 million  compared to 497 million in 2016  the 189 million yearoveryear increase was primarily driven by increased cash from operating activities of the sensus business acquired in the fourth quarter of 2016 and strong operating cash performance across the rest of the business 

during 2016  net cash provided by operating activities was 497 million  compared to 464 million in 2015  the 33 million yearoveryear increase was primarily driven by continued improvement in working capital levels the improvement in working capital includes significant contribution from the acquisition of sensus during the fourth quarter of 2016 which has positively impacted our working capital efficiency 

investing activities 

cash used in investing activities was 181 million in 2017  compared to 1886 million in 2016  this decrease of 1705 million was primarily driven by the 1782 million spent on the acquisition of sensus and two other businesses in 2016 as compared to the 33 million spent for acquisitions in 2017 this impact is partially offset by increased spending of 46 million over the prior year on capital projects including spending on capitalized software in the sensus business 

cash used in investing activities was 1886 million in 2016 compared to 132 million in 2015  the increase of 1754 million was primarily due to 1782 million spent on the acquisition of sensus and two other businesses in 2016 as compared to 18 million in 2015 cash provided from other investing activities partially offset the usage 

financing activities 

cash used by financing activities was 421 million in 2017  compared to cash generated by financing activities of 1034 in 2016 in 2017 the net decrease in cash provided was primarily due to the issuance of long term and short term debt related to acquisition financing in 2016 versus the net repayment of shortterm debt in 2017 see note 13 credit facilities and longterm debt of our consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of debt activities also contributing to the decrease in cash generated by financing activities were increased share repurchases and higher dividend payments in 2017 

cash generated by financing activities was 1034 million in 2016 in 2015 financing activities used 262 million of cash in 2016 the net increase in cash provided was due to the issuance of long term and short term debt related to acquisition financing and a reduction in share repurchases this increase was partially offset by net repayments of short term debt see note 13 credit facilities and longterm debt of our consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of debt activities and higher dividend payments 

funding and liquidity strategy 

our ability to fund our capital needs depends on our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access to bank financing and the capital markets historically we have generated operating cash flow sufficient to fund our primary cash needs centered on operating activities working capital capital expenditures strategic investments and dividends if our cash flows from operations are less than we expect we may need to incur debt or issue equity from time to time we may need to access the longterm and shortterm capital markets to obtain financing our access to and the availability of financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors including i our credit ratings or absence of a credit rating ii the liquidity of the overall capital markets and iii the current state of the economy there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or that such financing will be available at all 

we monitor our global funding requirements and seek to meet our liquidity needs on a cost effective basis based on our current global cash positions cash flows from operations and access to the commercial paper markets we believe there is sufficient liquidity to meet our funding requirements in addition our existing committed credit facilities and access to the public debt markets would provide further liquidity if required 

we anticipate that our present sources of funds including funds from operations and additional borrowings will provide us with sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet our liquidity and capital needs in both the united states and outside of the united states over the next twelve months 

credit facilities  longterm contractual commitments 

see note 13 credit facilities and longterm debt of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our credit facilities and longterm debt 

nonus operations 

for 2017 and 2016  we generated 54 and 58 of our revenue from nonus operations respectively while the addition of sensus increases our revenue profile in the us we continue to grow our operations in the emerging markets and elsewhere outside of the united states as such we expect to continue to generate significant revenue from nonus operations and expect a substantial portion of our cash will be predominately held by our foreign subsidiaries we expect to manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed we may transfer cash from certain international subsidiaries to the us and other international subsidiaries when we believe it is cost effective to do so we continually review our domestic and foreign cash profile expected future cash generation and investment opportunities and reassess whether there is a need to repatriate funds held internationally to support our us operations as of december 31 2017  we have provided a deferred tax liability of 20 million for foreign withholding taxes and state income taxes on 769 million expected to be repatriated to the us parent as deemed necessary 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual commitments as of december 31 2017  

in addition to the amounts presented in the table above we have recorded liabilities for net investment hedges of 64 million and employee severance indemnity of 16 million  these amounts have been excluded from the contractual obligations table due to an inability to reasonably estimate the timing or amounts of such payments in individual years further benefit payments which reflect expected future service related to the companys pension and other postretirement employee benefit obligations are presented in note 14  “postretirement benefit plans” of the consolidated financial statements and deferred income tax liabilities and uncertain tax positions are presented in note 6 income taxes of the consolidated financial statements and as such these obligations are not included in the above table finally estimated environmental payments and workers compensation and general liability reserves are excluded from the table above we estimate based on historical experience that we will spend approximately 2 million to 3 million per year on environmental investigation and remediation and approximately 6 million to 

7 million per year on workers compensation and general liability at december 31 2017  we had estimated and accrued 4 million and 30 million related to environmental matters and workers compensation and general liability respectively 

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2017  we have issued guarantees for the debt and other obligations of consolidated subsidiaries in the normal course of business we have determined that none of these arrangements has a material current effect or is reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our consolidated financial statements financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

we obtain certain standby letters of credit bank guarantees and surety bonds from thirdparty financial institutions in the ordinary course of business when required under contracts or to satisfy insurance related requirements as of december 31 2017  the amount of standby letters of credit bank guarantees and surety bonds was 240 million  

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 

significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are discussed in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” of the consolidated financial statements accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they are inherently uncertain involve significant judgments include areas where different estimates reasonably could have been used and changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable however actual results in these areas could differ from management’s estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured for product sales delivery does not occur until the products have been shipped risk of loss has been transferred to the customer and the contractual terms have been fulfilled in instances where contractual terms include a provision for customer acceptance revenue is recognized when either i we have previously demonstrated that the product meets the specified criteria based on either seller or customerspecified objective criteria or ii upon formal acceptance received from the customer where the product has not been previously demonstrated to meet customerspecified objective criteria revenue on service and repair contracts is recognized after services have been agreed to by the customer and rendered 

we enter into contracts to sell our products and services and while the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions certain agreements contain multiple elements or nonstandard terms and conditions where sales agreements contain multiple elements or nonstandard terms and conditions judgment is required to determine the appropriate accounting including whether the deliverables specified in these agreements should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes and if so how the transaction price should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize revenue for each element when a sale involves multiple deliverables the total revenue from the arrangement is allocated to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price of the deliverable to all other deliverables in the contract revenue for multiple element arrangements is recognized when the appropriate revenue recognition criteria for the individual deliverable have been satisfied generally these elements are satisfied within the same reporting period although certain contracts may be completed over 6 months the allocation of sales price between elements may impact the timing of 

revenue recognition but will not change the total revenue recognized on the arrangement for delivered elements accounted for as separate units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement revenue is recognized only when the delivered elements have standalone value there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance and there are no customernegotiated refund or return rights affecting the sales recognized 

certain businesses enter into longterm constructiontype sales contracts for which revenue is recognized under the percentageofcompletion method based upon percentage of costs incurred to total estimated costs 

we record a reduction in revenue at the time of sale for estimated product returns rebates and other allowances based on historical experience and known trends 

we adopted the new accounting guidance regarding revenue from contracts with customers january 1 2018 using the modified retrospective approach refer to note 2 “recently issued accounting pronouncements” adoption of the guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements 

income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities applying enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences will reverse based on the evaluation of available evidence we recognize future tax benefits such as net operating loss carryforwards to the extent that we believe it is more likely than not we will realize these benefits we periodically assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets and reflect any changes to our estimate of the amount we are more likely than not to realize in the valuation allowance with a corresponding adjustment to earnings or other comprehensive income as appropriate 

in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we look to the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences taxable income in carryback years and the feasibility of tax planning strategies and estimated future taxable income the valuation allowance can be affected by changes to tax laws changes to statutory tax rates and changes to future taxable income estimates 

due to us tax reform we have recorded provisional amounts of foreign withholding taxes and state income taxes on earnings that are expected to be repatriated to the us parent the company intends to distribute a portion of the earnings taxed under the tax act we have not recorded any deferred taxes on the amounts that the company currently does not intend to distribute as the determination of any deferred taxes on this amount is not practicable 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and to the extent to which additional taxes will be due furthermore we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

we adjust our liability for uncertain tax positions in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional tax expense would result if a payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 

business combinations we record acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting all of the assets acquired liabilities assumed contractual contingencies and contingent consideration is recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill the application of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in order to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill these assumptions and estimates include a market participant’s use of the asset and the appropriate discount rates for a market participant our estimates are based on historical experience information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and when appropriate includes assistance from independent thirdparty appraisal firms significant assumptions and estimates include but are not limited to the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future the cost to buildrecreate certain technology the appropriate weightedaverage cost of capital and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset these estimates are inherently uncertain and 

unpredictable in addition unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates 

goodwill and intangible assets we review goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable we also review the carrying value of our finitelived intangible assets for potential impairment when impairment indicators arise we conduct our annual impairment test as of the first day of the fourth quarter for goodwill the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is not impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value then an impairment charge is recognized for that excess up to the amount of recorded goodwill we estimate the fair value of our reporting units and intangible assets with indefinite lives using an income approach under the income approach we calculate fair value based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinitelived intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions particularly related to future operating results and cash flows these estimates and assumptions include but are not limited to revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates assumed royalty rates future economic and market conditions and identification of appropriate market comparable data in addition the identification of reporting units and the allocation of assets and liabilities to the reporting units when determining the carrying value of each reporting unit also require judgment goodwill is tested for impairment at either the operating segment identified in note 20  “segment and geographic data” of the consolidated financial statements or one level below the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets is based on estimates and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable significant changes to these estimates and assumptions could adversely impact our conclusions actual future results may differ from those estimates 

during the fourth quarter of 2017  we performed our annual impairment assessment and determined that the estimated fair values of our goodwill reporting units were substantially in excess of each of their carrying values however future goodwill impairment tests could result in a charge to earnings we will continue to evaluate goodwill on an annual basis as of the beginning of our fourth quarter and whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate there may be a potential impairment we determined that no impairment of the indefinitelived intangibles existed as of the measurement date in 2017  however future indefinitelived intangible impairment tests could result in a charge to earnings we will continue to evaluate indefinitelived intangibles on an annual basis as of the beginning of our fourth quarter and whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate there may be a potential impairment 

contingent liabilities as discussed in note 18  commitments and contingencies of the consolidated financial statements the company is from time to time subject to a variety of litigation environmental liabilities product liabilities and similar contingent liabilities incidental to its business or the business operations of previously owned entities the company recognizes a liability for any contingency that is known or probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable these assessments require judgments concerning matters such as litigation developments and outcomes the anticipated outcome of negotiations the number of future claims and the cost of both pending and future claims in addition because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time liabilities may change in the future due to various factors including those discussed in note 18 of the consolidated financial statements if the liabilities established by the company with respect to these contingencies are inadequate the company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the recorded liability which would adversely affect the company’s financial statements 

receivables and allowance for doubtful accounts and discounts receivables primarily comprise uncollected amounts owed to us from transactions with customers and are presented net of allowances for doubtful accounts and early payment discounts 

we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts using a combination of factors to reduce our trade receivable balances to their estimated net realizable amount we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a variety of factors including the length of time receivables are past due macroeconomic trends and conditions significant onetime events historical experience and the financial condition of customers in addition we record a specific reserve for individual accounts when we become aware of specific customer circumstances such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer’s operating results or financial position the past due or delinquency status of a receivable is based on the contractual payment terms of the receivable if circumstances related to the specific customer change we adjust estimates of the recoverability of receivables as appropriate we determine our allowance for early payment discounts primarily based on historical experience with customers 

credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is generally diversified due to the large number of entities comprising our customer base and their dispersion across many different geographical regions we perform ongoing credit evaluations of the financial condition of our thirdparty distributors resellers and other customers and require collateral such as letters of credit and bank guarantees in certain circumstances as of december 31 2017 and 2016 we do not believe we have any significant concentrations of credit risk 

postretirement plans company employees around the world participate in numerous defined benefit plans the determination of projected benefit obligations and the recognition of expenses related to these plans are dependent on various assumptions these major assumptions primarily relate to discount rates expected longterm rates of return on plan assets rate of future compensation increases mortality health care inflation and years of service some of which are disclosed in note 14  “postretirement benefit plans” of the consolidated financial statements and other factors actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized on a straightline basis only to the extent they exceed 10 of the higher of the marketrelated value or projected benefit obligation over the average remaining service period of active plan participants or for plans with all or substantially all inactive participants over the average remaining life expectancy 

significant assumptions 

management develops each assumption using relevant company experience in conjunction with marketrelated data for each individual country in which such plans exist all assumptions are reviewed annually with thirdparty consultants and adjusted as necessary the table included below provides the weighted average assumptions used to estimate our defined benefit pension obligations and costs as of and for the years ended 2017 and 2016  



 we determine the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets by evaluating both historical returns and estimates of future returns specifically the company analyzes the estimated future returns based on independent estimates of asset class returns and evaluates historical broad market returns over longterm timeframes based on the strategic asset allocation which is detailed in note 14  “postretirement benefit plans” of the consolidated financial statements 

based on the approach described above the chart below shows weighted average actual returns versus the weighted average expected longterm rates of return for our pension plans that were utilized in the calculation of the net periodic pension cost for each respective year 

for the recognition of net periodic pension cost the calculation of the expected return on plan assets is generally derived by applying the expected longterm rate of return to the marketrelated value of plan assets the marketrelated value of plan assets is based on average asset values at the measurement date over the last five years the use of fair value rather than a calculated value could materially affect net periodic pension cost the weighted average expected longterm rate of return for all of our plan assets to be used in determining net periodic benefit costs for 2018 is estimated at 730  we estimate that every 25 basis point change in the expected return on plan assets impacts the expense by 1 million 

the discount rate reflects our expectation of the present value of expected future cash payments for benefits at the measurement date a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense we base the discount rate assumption on current investment yields of highquality fixed income 

investments during the retirement benefits maturity period the pension discount rate was determined by considering an interest rate yield curve comprising aaaaa bonds with maturities between zero and 30 years developed by the plan’s actuaries annual benefit payments are then discounted to present value using this yield curve to develop a singlepoint discount rate matching the plan’s characteristics our weighted average discount rate for all pension plans effective january 1 2018  is 258  we estimate that every 25 basis point change in the discount rate impacts the expense by 1 million 

the rate of future compensation increase assumption reflects our longterm actual experience and future and nearterm outlook effective january 1 2018  our expected rate of future compensation is 303 for all pension plans the estimated impact of a 25 basis point change in the expected rate of future compensation is less than 1 million 

the assumed rate of future increases in the per capita cost of health care the health care trend rate is 872 for 2018  decreasing ratably to 450 in 2026 an increase or decrease in the health care trend rates by one percent per year would impact the aggregate annual service and interest components by less than 1 million and impact the benefit obligation by approximately 4 million 

we currently anticipate making contributions to our pension and postretirement benefit plans in the range of 20 million to 30 million during 2018  of which 6 million is expected to be made in the first quarter 

funded status 

funded status is derived by subtracting the respective yearend values of the projected benefit obligations from the fair value of plan assets we estimate that every 25 basis point change in the discount rate impacts the funded status by approximately 31 million 

fair value of plan assets 

the plan assets of our pension plans comprise a broad range of investments including domestic and foreign equity securities interests in private equity and hedge funds fixed income investments insurance contracts and cash and cash equivalents 

a portion of our pension benefit plan assets portfolio comprises investments in private equity and hedge funds the private equity and hedge fund investments are generally measured at net asset value however in certain instances the values reported by the asset managers were not current at the measurement date accordingly we made estimate adjustments to the last reported value where necessary to measure the assets at fair value at the measurement date these adjustments consider information received from the asset managers as well as general market information the adjustment recorded at december 31 2017 and 2016 for these assets represented less than one percent of total plan assets in each respective year asset values for other positions were generally measured using market observable prices we estimate that a 5 change in asset values will impact funded status by approximately 29 million

 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates these exposures are actively monitored by management our exposure to foreign exchange rate risk is due to certain costs revenue and borrowings being denominated in currencies other than one of our subsidiaries functional currency similarly we are exposed to market risk as the result of changes in interest rates which may affect the cost of our financing it is our policy and practice to use derivative financial instruments only to the extent necessary to manage exposures 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we conduct approximately 54 of our business in various locations outside the united states 

our economic foreign currency risk primarily relates to receipts from customers payments to suppliers and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies we may use derivative financial instruments to offset risk related to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers when it is believed that the exposure will not be limited by our normal operating and financing activities we enter into currency forward contracts periodically in order to manage the exchange rate fluctuation risk on certain intercompany transactions associated with third party sales and purchases these risks are also mitigated by natural hedges including the presence of manufacturing facilities outside the united states global sourcing and other spending which occurs in foreign countries our principal foreign currency transaction exposures primarily relate to the euro swedish krona polish zloty canadian dollar british pound and australian dollar we estimate that a hypothetical 10 movement in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material economic impact to xylem’s financial position and results of operations 

additionally we are subject to foreign exchange translation risk due to changes in the value of foreign currencies in relation to our reporting currency the us dollar the translation risk is primarily concentrated in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro british pound chinese yuan canadian dollar swedish krona and australian dollar as the us dollar strengthens against other currencies in which we transact business revenue and income will generally be negatively impacted and if the us dollar weakens revenue and income will generally be positively impacted we estimate that a hypothetical 10 movement of the us dollar to the various foreign currency exchange rates we translate from in the aggregate could have approximately a 5 and 6 impact on xylems consolidated revenue and income respectively as reported in us dollars we expect to continue to generate significant revenue from nonus operations and we expect our cash will be predominately held by our foreign subsidiaries we expect to manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed we may transfer cash from certain international subsidiaries to the us and other international subsidiaries when it is cost effective to do so though we continually review our domestic and foreign cash profile expected future cash generation and investment opportunities and reassess whether there is a need repatriate funds held internationally to support our us operations accordingly we do not expect translation risk to have a material economic impact on our financial position and results of operations 

interest rate risk 

as of december 31 2017  our long term debt portfolio is primarily comprised of four series of fixedrate senior notes that total 21 billion the senior notes are not exposed to interest rate risk as the bonds are at a fixedrate until maturity based on current interest rate market we do not anticipate material risk associated with our debt refinancing within the target timeframe of completion 

commodity price exposures 

portions of our business are exposed to volatility in the prices of certain commodities such as copper nickel and aluminum among others our primary exposure to this volatility resides with the use of these materials in purchased component parts we generally maintain longterm fixed price contracts on raw materials and component parts however we are prone to exposure as these contracts expire we estimate that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in prices for raw metal commodities would not be material to our financial position and results of operations

on october 31 2016 xylem inc completed the acquisition of all of the direct and indirect subsidiaries of sensus worldwide limited other than sensus industries “sensus” pursuant to the terms of the share purchase agreement dated as of august 15 2016 and the first amendment to the share purchase agreement dated as of october 31 2016 together the “purchase agreement” the aggregate consideration paid for the acquisition was approximately  17 billion in cash subject to certain adjustments as provided in the purchase agreement the consideration was funded with a combination of cash on hand proceeds from issuances under the company’s existing commercial paper program borrowings under a new eurodenominated term loan and the issuance of 500 million aggregate principal amount of 3250 senior notes due 2026 and 400 million aggregate principal amount of 4375 senior notes due 2046 

our industry 

our planet faces serious water challenges less than 1 of the total water available on earth is fresh water and these supplies are under threat due to factors such as the draining of aquifers increased pollution and the effects of climate change demand for fresh water is rising rapidly due to population growth industrial expansion and increased agricultural development with consumption estimated to double every 20 years by 2025 more than 30 of the world’s population is expected to live in areas without adequate water supply even in developed countries with sufficient clean water supply existing infrastructure for water supply is aging and inadequately funded in the united states deteriorating pipe systems lose approximately one out of every six gallons of water between the treatment plant and the end customer part of a national and global problem of ‘nonrevenue water’ that is a major financial challenge of many utilities these challenges create opportunities for growth in the global water industry which we estimate to have a total market size of approximately 550 billion  

we compete in areas that are pivotal to improving water productivity water quality and resilience water productivity refers to the more efficient delivery and use of clean water water quality refers to the efficient and effective management of wastewater resilience refers to the management of waterrelated risks and the resilience of water infrastructure the company’s customers often face all three of these challenges ranging from inefficient and aging water distribution networks which require increases in “water productivity” energyintensive or unreliable wastewater management systems which require increases in “water quality” or exposure to natural disasters such as floods or droughts which require increases in “resilience” additionally through the recent acquisition of sensus we now also provide solutions to enhance efficiency improve safety and conserve resources to customers in the electric and gas sectors delivering value in these areas creates significant opportunity for the company we estimate our total served market size to be approximately 54 billion 

the global water industry value chain 

the water industry value chain is comprised of equipment and services companies like xylem which address the unique challenges and demands of a diverse customer base this customer base includes utilities that supply water through an infrastructure network and engineering procurement and construction or epc firms which work with utilities to design and build water and wastewater infrastructure networks as depicted below utilities and epc customers are looking for technology and application expertise from their equipment and services providers to address trends such as rising pollution stricter regulations and the increased outsourcing of process knowledge in addition to utilities and epc customers equipment and service providers also provide distinct technologies to a wide array of entities including farms mines power plants industrial facilities and residential buildings 

water industry supply chain 

business strategy 

our strategy is to enhance shareholder value by providing distinctive solutions for our customers most important water productivity quality and resilience challenges enabling us to grow revenue organically and through strategic acquisitions as we streamline our cost structure key elements of our strategy are summarized below 

 

business segments distribution and competitive landscape 

we have t hree reportable business segments that are aligned around the critical market applications they provide water infrastructure applied water and sensus see note 20  “segment and geographic data” in our consolidated financial statements for financial information about segments and geographic areas 

the table and descriptions below provide an overview of our business segments 

water infrastructure 

our water infrastructure segment supports the process that collects water from a source and distributes it to users and then returns the wastewater responsibly to the environment through three closely linked applications transport  treatment and test  the transport application also includes sales and rental of specialty dewatering pumps and related equipment and services which provide the safe removal or draining of groundwater and surface water from a riverbed construction site or mine shaft and bypass pumping for the repair of aging public utility infrastructure as well as emergency water removal during severe weather events 

the customer base consists of two primary end markets public utility and industrial the public utility market includes public private and publicprivate entities that support water and wastewater networks the industrial market includes customers who require similar water and wastewater infrastructure networks to support various industrial operations 

water infrastructure provides the majority of its sales through direct channels with remaining sales through indirect channels and service capabilities both public utility and industrial facility customers increasingly require our teams’ global but locally proficient expertise to use our equipment in their specific applications several trends are increasing the need for this application expertise i the increase in both the type and amount of contaminants found in the water supply ii increasing environmental regulations iii the need to increase system efficiencies to optimize energy costs iv the retirement of a largely aging water industry workforce that has not been systematically replaced at utilities and other enduser customers and v the buildout of water infrastructure in the 

emerging markets we estimate our served market size in this sector to be approximately 23 billion 

given the highly fragmented nature of the water industry the water infrastructure segment competes with a large number of businesses we differentiate ourselves in the market by focusing on product performance reliability and innovation application expertise brand reputation energy efficiency product lifecycle cost timeliness of delivery proximity of service centers effectiveness of our distribution channels and price in the sale of products and services we benefit from our large installed base which requires maintenance repair and replacement parts due to the critical application and nature of the products and the conditions under which they operate timeliness of delivery quality and the proximity of service centers are important customer considerations when selecting a provider for aftermarket products and services as well as equipment rentals in geographic regions where we are locally positioned to provide a quick response customers have historically relied on us rather than our competitors for aftermarket products relating to our highly engineered and customized solutions our key competitors within the water infrastructure segment include ksb inc sulzer ltd evoqua water technologies and danaher corporation 

applied water 

applied water encompasses the uses of water and serves a diverse set of end markets including residential commercial industrial and agricultural residential consumers represent the end users in the residential market while owners and managers of properties such as apartment buildings retail stores institutional buildings restaurants schools hospitals and hotels are examples of end users in the commercial market the industrial market includes oems exploration and production firms and developers and managers of industrial facilities such as electrical power generators chemical manufacturers machine shops clothing manufacturers beverage dispensing and food processing firms and car washes agricultural end users include owners and operators of crop and livestock farms aquaculture golf courses and other turf applications 

in the applied water segment enduse areas vary widely so specialized distribution partners are often preferred our products in the applied water segment are sold through our global direct sales and strong indirect channels with the majority of revenue going through indirect channels we have longstanding relationships with many of the leading independent distributors in the markets we serve and we provide incentives to distributors such as specialized loyalty and training programs 

we estimate our served market size in this sector to be approximately 19 billion population growth urbanization and regulatory requirements are macro growth drivers of these markets driving the need for housing food community services and retail goods within growing city centers 

competition in the applied water segment focuses on brand equity application expertise product delivery and performance quality and price we compete by offering a wide variety of innovative and highquality products coupled with worldclass application expertise we believe our distribution through wellestablished channels and our reputation for quality significantly enhance our market position our ability to deliver innovative product offerings has allowed us to compete effectively to cultivate and maintain customer relationships and to serve and expand into many niche and new markets our key competitors within the applied water segment include grundfos wilo se pentair ltd and franklin electric co inc 

sensus 

sensus develops advanced technology solutions that enable intelligent use and conservation of critical water and energy resources the segment delivers communications smart metering measurement and control technologies and services that allow customers to more effectively use their distribution networks for the delivery of critical resources such as water electricity and natural gas additionally we sell software and services including cloudbased analytics remote monitoring and data management as well as smart lighting products and solutions that improve efficiency and public safety efforts across communities 

at the heart of our leading technologies is automation and information communications networks automate and optimize meter reading monitor flow and detect and enable rapid response to unsafe conditions in short they provide insight into operations and enable our customers to manage the entire scope of their operations remotely through their networks 

at the center of our offering is the flexnet communication network which provides a common communications platform and infrastructure for essential services this twoway communication technology remotely connects a wide variety of smart points in a given network with protocols frequently on licensed spectrum that enable reliable resilient and secure transmissions these technologies allow our customers to remotely and continuously monitor infrastructure prioritize and manage maintenance and use data to optimize all aspects of their networks 

the majority of our sales in the us are conducted through strong longstanding relationships with leading distributors and dedicated channel partners for water gas and electric markets internationally direct sales are often made in markets without established distribution channels however some distribution channels are used in more developed markets with large utilities and government programs a more direct sales approach with key account management is employed 

we estimate our served market size in this sector to be approximately 12 billion macro growth drivers include increasing regulation and worldwide movement towards smart grid implementation water scarcity and conservation as well as the need to prevent revenue loss via inaccurate meter readings leaks or theft are among the drivers of smart meter technologies 

our sensusbranded meters are well positioned in the smart metering sector the fastest growing sector of the global meter industry we set ourselves apart in the industry by focusing on new product development and service offerings that are driving tangible savings of nonrevenue water through improved meter accuracy reduced theft and identification of leaks our key competitors within the sensus segment include itron badger meter landys  gyr neptune roper and elster honeywell 

geographic profile 

the table below illustrates the annual revenue and percentage of revenue by geographic area for each of the three years ended december 31

the table below illustrates the property plant  equipment and percentage of property plant  equipment by geographic area for each of the three years ended december 31 

supply and seasonality 

we have a global manufacturing footprint with production facilities in europe north america latin america and asia our inventory management and distribution practices seek to minimize inventory holding periods by striving to take delivery of the inventory and manufacturing as close as possible to the sale or distribution of products to our customers all of our businesses require various parts and raw materials of which the availability and prices may fluctuate parts and raw materials commonly used in our products include motors fabricated parts castings bearings seals nickel copper aluminum plastics pcbs and electronic components while we may recover some cost increases through operational improvements we are still exposed to some pricing risk including increased pricing risk due to proposed duty and tariff assessments by the united states on foreign imports we attempt to control costs through fixed priced contracts with suppliers and various other programs such as our global procurement initiative 

our business relies on thirdparty suppliers contract manufacturing and commodity markets to secure raw materials parts and components used in our products we typically acquire materials and components through a 

combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our materials requirements for most of our products we have existing alternate sources of supply or such sources are readily available 

we may experience price volatility or supply constraints for materials that are not available from multiple sources from time to time we acquire certain inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longerterm pricing commitments with vendors to improve the priority price and availability of supply there have been no raw material shortages in the past several years that have had a significant adverse impact on our business as a whole 

our business segments experience a modest level of seasonality in their business this seasonality is dependent on factors such as capital spending of customers as well as weather conditions including heavy flooding droughts and fluctuations in temperatures which can positively or negatively impact portions of our business 

customers 

our business is not dependent on any single customer or a few customers the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our company no individual customer accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated 2016  2015 or 2014 revenue 

backlog 

delivery schedules vary from customer to customer based on their requirements typically large projects require longer lead production cycles and delays can occur from time to time total backlog was 1078 million at december 31 2016 and 716 million at december 31 2015  this increase is primarily attributable to the addition of sensus who had a backlog balance of 385 million at december 31 2016 we anticipate that more than 70 of the backlog at december 31 2016 will be recognized as revenue during 2017  backlog includes contractual customer commitments as well as purchase orders on hand as of the end of the period 

research and development 

research and development “rd” is a key foundation of our growth strategy and we focus on the design and development of products and application knowhow that anticipate customer needs and emerging trends our engineers are involved in new product development as well as improvement of existing products to increase customer value our businesses invest substantial resources into rd we anticipate we will continue to develop and invest in our rd capabilities to promote a steady flow of innovative highquality and reliable products and applications to further strengthen our position in the markets we serve we invested 110 million  95 million  and 104 million in rd in 2016  2015 and 2014  respectively 

we have rd and product development capabilities around the world rd activities are initially conducted in our technology centers located in conjunction with some of our major manufacturing facilities to ensure an efficient and robust development process we have several global technical centers and local development teams around the world where we are supporting global needs and accelerating the customization of our application expertise to local needs in some cases our rd activities are conducted at our piloting and testing facilities and at strategic customer sites these piloting and testing facilities enable us to serve our strategic markets in specific regions worldwide 

intellectual property 

we generally seek patent protection for those inventions and improvements that we believe will improve our competitive position we believe that our patents and applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and improving our return on research and development investments while we own control or license a significant number of patents trade secrets proprietary information trademarks trade names copyrights and other intellectual property rights which in the aggregate are of material importance to our business management believes that our business as a whole as well as each of our core business segments is not materially dependent on any one intellectual property right or related group of such rights 

patents patent applications and license agreements expire or terminate over time by operation of law in accordance with their terms or otherwise as the portfolio of our patents patent applications and license agreements has evolved over time we do not expect the expiration of any specific patent to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

environmental matters and regulation 

our manufacturing operations worldwide are subject to many requirements under environmental laws in the united states the environmental protection agency and similar state agencies administer laws and regulations concerning air emissions water discharges waste disposal environmental remediation and other aspects of environmental 

protection such environmental laws and regulations in the united states include for example the federal clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act environmental requirements significantly affect our operations we have established an internal program to address compliance with applicable environmental requirements and as a result management believes that we are in substantial compliance with current environmental regulations 

while environmental laws and regulations are subject to change such changes can be difficult to predict reliably and the timing of potential changes is uncertain management does not believe based on current circumstances that compliance costs pursuant to such regulations will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations however the effect of future legislative or regulatory changes could be material to our financial condition or results of operations 

accruals for environmental matters are recorded on a sitebysite basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on current law and existing technologies it can be difficult to estimate reliably the final costs of investigation and remediation due to various factors our accrued liabilities for these environmental matters represent the best estimates related to the investigation and remediation of environmental media such as water soil soil vapor air and structures as well as related legal fees based upon the facts and circumstances as currently known to us these estimates and related accruals are reviewed quarterly and updated for progress of investigation and remediation efforts and changes in facts and legal circumstances liabilities for these environmental expenditures are recorded on an undiscounted basis we do not anticipate these liabilities will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations at december 31 2016  we had estimated and accrued 4 million related to environmental matters 

employees 

as of december 31 2016  xylem had approximately 16000 employees worldwide we have more than 5200 employees in the united states of whom approximately 17 are represented by labor unions and in certain foreign countries some of our employees are represented by work councils we believe that our facilities are in favorable labor markets with ready access to adequate numbers of workers and believe our relations with our employees are good

we offer our products and services in competitive markets we believe the principal points of competition in our markets are product performance reliability and innovation application expertise brand reputation energy efficiency product life cycle cost timeliness of delivery proximity of service centers effectiveness of our distribution channels and price maintaining and improving our competitive position will require successful management of these factors including continued investment by us in manufacturing research and development engineering marketing customer service and support and our distribution networks our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors including our ability to i identify emerging technological trends in our target endmarkets ii develop and maintain competitive products and defend our market share against an everexpanding number of competitors including many new and nontraditional competitors iii enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization of our products iv develop manufacture and bring compelling new products to market quickly and costeffectively and v attract develop and retain individuals with the requisite technical expertise and understanding of customers’ needs to develop new technologies and introduce new products 

we may not be successful in maintaining our competitive position our competitors may develop disruptive technologies or products that are superior to our products or may develop more efficient or effective methods of providing products and services or may adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies or evolving customer requirements the failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects pricing pressures also could cause us to adjust the prices of certain products to stay competitive which could adversely affect our financial performance failure to continue competing successfully or to win large contracts could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by global economic and financial market conditions 

we compete around the world in various geographic and product markets in 2016  42  31 and 21 of our total revenue was from customers located in the united states europe and emerging markets respectively we expect revenue from these markets to be significant for the foreseeable future important factors impacting our businesses include the overall strength of these economies and our customers’ confidence in both local and global macroeconomic conditions industrial and federal state local and municipal governmental fiscal and trade policies the strength of the residential and commercial real estate markets interest rates availability of commercial financing for our customers and endusers and unemployment rates a slowdown or prolonged downturn in our markets could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

economic and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our business 

in 2016  58 of our total revenue was from customers outside the united states with 21 of total revenue generated in emerging markets we expect our sales from international operations and export sales to continue to be a significant portion of our revenue we have placed a particular emphasis on increasing our growth and presence in emerging markets both our sales from international operations and export sales are subject in varying degrees to risks inherent to doing business outside the united states these risks include the following 



 any payment of distributions loans or advances to us by our foreign subsidiaries could be subject to restrictions on or taxation of dividends on repatriation of earnings under applicable local law monetary transfer restrictions and foreign currency exchange regulations in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate in addition to the general risks that we face outside the united states our operations in emerging markets could involve additional uncertainties for us including risks that governments may impose limitations on our ability to repatriate funds governments may impose withholding or other taxes on remittances and other payments to us or the amount of any such taxes may increase an outbreak or escalation of any insurrection or armed conflict may occur governments may seek to nationalize our assets or governments may impose or increase investment barriers or other restrictions affecting our business in addition emerging markets pose other uncertainties including the difficulty of enforcing agreements challenges collecting receivables protection of our intellectual property and other assets pressure on the pricing of our products higher business conduct risks less qualified talent and risks of political instability we cannot predict the impact such events might have on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our strategy includes acquisitions and we may not be able to make acquisitions of suitable candidates or integrate acquisitions successfully 

as part of our growth strategy we plan to pursue the acquisition of other companies assets and product lines that either complement or expand our existing business we may not be able to identify suitable candidates successfully negotiate appropriate acquisition terms obtain financing that may be needed to consummate those acquisitions complete proposed acquisitions successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or expand into new markets in addition we cannot make assurances that any acquisition once successfully integrated will perform as planned be accretive to earnings or prove to be beneficial to our operations or cash flow 

acquisitions involve a number of risks and present financial managerial and operational challenges including diversion of management attention from existing businesses and operations integration of technology operations personnel and financial and other systems potentially insufficient internal controls over financial activities or financial reporting at an acquired entity that could impact us on a combined basis the failure to realize expected synergies the possibility that we become exposed to substantial undisclosed liabilities or new material risks associated with the acquired businesses and the loss of key employees of the acquired businesses failure to successfully execute our acquisition strategy could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring plans and our restructuring may adversely affect our business 

in recent fiscal years we have initiated restructuring plans in an effort to optimize our cost structure and improve our operational efficiency and effectiveness we may not be able to obtain the cost savings and benefits that were initially anticipated in connection with our restructuring additionally as a result of our restructuring we may experience a loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge or inefficiency during transitional periods reorganization and restructuring can require a significant amount of management and other employees time and focus which may divert attention from operating and growing our business 

the successful implementation and execution of our restructuring and realignment actions is critical to achieving our expected cost savings as well as effectively competing in the marketplace factors that may impede a successful implementation include the retention of key employees the impact of regulatory matters and adverse economic market conditions if our restructuring actions are not executed successfully it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position business financial condition and results of operations 

our business could be adversely affected by cyber threats or interruptions in information technology communications networks and operations 

our business operations rely on information technology and communications networks and operations that are vulnerable to damage or disturbance from a variety of sources regardless of protection measures essentially all systems are susceptible to disruption due to failure vandalism insider risk computer viruses security breaches natural disasters power outages and other events in addition we have designed products and services that connect to and are part of the “internet of things” while we attempt to provide adequate security measures to safeguard our products from cyber threats the potential for an attack remains a successful attack may result in inappropriate access to our or our customers information or an inability for our products to function properly 

we and some of our third party vendors have experienced cybersecurity attacks in the past and may experience them in the future potentially with more frequency to date none have resulted in any material adverse impact to our business or operations we have adopted measures to mitigate potential risks associated with information technology disruptions and cybersecurity threats however given the unpredictability of the timing nature and scope of such disruptions we could potentially be subject to production downtimes operational delays other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information destruction or corruption of data security breaches other manipulation or improper use of our systems or networks financial losses from remedial actions loss of business or potential liability regulatory enforcement actions andor damage to our reputation any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition we also have a concentration of operations on certain sites such as production and shared services centers where business interruptions could cause material damage and costs transport of goods from suppliers and to customers could also be hampered for the reasons stated above 

although we continue to assess these risks implement controls and perform business continuity and disaster recovery planning we cannot be sure that interruptions with material adverse effects will not occur 

failure to comply with laws regulations and policies including the us foreign corrupt practices act or other applicable anticorruption legislation could result in fines criminal penalties and an adverse effect on our business 

we are subject to regulation under a wide variety of us federal and state and nonus laws regulations and policies including laws related to anticorruption trade regulations including export and import compliance antitrust and money laundering due to our global operations the us foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa the uk bribery act of 2010 and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from improper conduct of our employees or business partners in the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees or agents have or may have violated applicable laws including anticorruption laws we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management any such violation could result in substantial fines sanctions civil andor criminal penalties and curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions and might materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition in addition actual or alleged violations could damage our reputation and ability to do business furthermore detecting investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations is expensive and can consume significant time and attention of our senior management 

our business could be adversely affected by significant movements in foreign currency exchange rates 

we conduct approximately 58 of our business in various locations outside the united states we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency transaction exchange rates particularly with respect to the euro swedish krona canadian dollar british pound polish zloty and australian dollar any significant change in the value of currencies of the countries in which we do business relative to the value of the us dollar or euro could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations additionally we are subject to foreign exchange translation risk due to changes in the value of foreign currencies in relation to our reporting currency the us dollar the translation risk is primarily concentrated in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro british pound chinese yuan swedish krona canadian dollar and australian dollar as the us dollar fluctuates against other currencies in which we transact business revenue and income can be impacted for instance our 2016 revenue decreased by 

20 due to unfavorable foreign currency impacts continued strengthening of the us dollar relative to the euro and the currencies of the other countries in which we do business could materially and adversely affect our revenue growth in future periods refer to item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information on foreign exchange risk 

failure to retain our existing senior management engineering sales and other key personnel or the inability to attract and retain new qualified personnel could negatively impact our ability to operate or grow our business 

our success will continue to depend to a significant extent on our ability to retain or attract a significant number of employees in senior management engineering sales and other key personnel the ability to attract or retain employees will depend on our ability to offer competitive compensation training and cultural benefits we will need to continue to develop a roster of qualified talent to support business growth and replace departing employees effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution a failure to retain or attract highly skilled personnel could adversely affect our operating results or ability to operate or grow our business 

product defects and unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure with respect to our products could adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements 

manufacturing or design defects in including in products or components that we source from third parties unanticipated use of or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of our products could create product safety regulatory or environmental risks including personal injury death or property damage these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products result in the removal of a product from the market and result in product liability claims being brought against us although we have liability insurance we cannot be certain that this insurance coverage will continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost or will be adequate to cover any product liability claims recalls removals and product liability claims can result in significant costs as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

weather conditions and climate changes may adversely affect or cause volatility in our financial results 

weather conditions including heavy flooding droughts and fluctuations in temperatures or weather patterns including as a result of climate change can positively or negatively impact portions of our business within the dewatering space pumps provided through our godwin and flygt brands are used to remove excess or unwanted water heavy flooding due to weather conditions drives increased demand for these applications on the other hand drought conditions drive higher demand for pumps used in agricultural and turf irrigation applications such as those provided by our goulds water technology flowtronex and lowara brands fluctuations to warmer and cooler temperatures result in varying levels of demand for products used in residential and commercial applications where homes and buildings are heated and cooled with hvac units such as those provided by our bg brand given the unpredictable nature of weather conditions and climate change this may result in volatility for certain portions of our business as well as the operations of certain of our customers and suppliers 

our financial results can be difficult to predict 

our business is impacted by an increasing amount of short cycle and bookandbill business which we have limited insight into particularly for the business that we transact through our distributors we are also impacted by large projects whose timing can change based upon customer requirements due to a number of factors affecting the project such as funding readiness of the project and regulatory approvals accordingly our financial results for any given period can be difficult to predict 

changes in our effective tax rates may adversely affect our financial results 

we sell our products in more than 150 countries and 58 of our revenue was generated outside the united states in 2016  given the global nature of our business a number of factors may increase our future effective tax rates including 



any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could reduce net income for future periods 

our business could be adversely affected by inflation and other manufacturing and operating cost increases 

our operating costs are subject to fluctuations particularly due to changes in commodity prices raw materials energy and related utilities freight and cost of labor in order to remain competitive we may not be able to recuperate all or a portion of these higher costs from our customers through product price increases further in a declining price environment our operating margins may contract because we account for inventory using the firstin first out method actions we take to mitigate volatility in manufacturing and operating costs may not be successful and as a result our business financial condition and results of operation could be materially and adversely affected 

our business could be adversely affected by the inability of suppliers to meet delivery requirements 

our business relies on thirdparty suppliers contract manufacturing and commodity markets to secure raw materials parts and components used in our products parts and raw materials commonly used in our products include motors fabricated parts castings bearings seals nickel copper aluminum and plastics we are exposed to the availability of these materials which may be subject to curtailment or change due to among other things interruptions in production by suppliers labor disputes the impaired financial condition of a particular supplier suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers changes in tariff regimes exchange rates and prevailing price levels ability to meet regulatory requirements weather emergencies or acts of war or terrorism any delay in our suppliers’ abilities to provide us with necessary materials could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers and accordingly could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operational flexibility 

as of december 31 2016  our total outstanding indebtedness was 2368 million as described under “liquidity and capital resources our indebtedness could 

 in addition there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available to us on favorable terms or at all for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness if we incur additional debt or raise equity through the issuance of preferred stock the terms of the debt or preferred stock issued may give the holders rights preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock particularly in the event of liquidation the terms of the debt may also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on our operations than we currently have 

our ability to make scheduled principal payments of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance which may be affected by factors beyond our control if we are unable to service our indebtedness our business financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 

we may be negatively impacted by litigation and regulatory proceedings 

we are subject to various laws ordinances regulations and other requirements of government authorities in foreign countries and in the united states any violation of which could potentially create substantial liability for us and also damage to our reputation changes in laws ordinances regulations or other government policies the nature timing and effect of which are uncertain may significantly increase our expenses and liabilities 

from time to time we are involved in legal proceedings that are incidental to the operation of our businesses these proceedings may seek remedies relating to environmental matters acquisitions or divestitures product liability and personal injury claims employment labor and pension matters and government contract issues and commercial or 

contractual disputes our acquisition of sensus has increased our exposure to intellectual property litigation and we expect that this risk will continue to increase as we execute on our innovation and technology priorities 

it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of claims investigations and lawsuits and we could in the future incur judgments fines or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in any particular period additionally we may be required to change or cease operations at one or more facilities if a regulatory agency determines that we have failed to comply with laws regulations or orders applicable to our business 

the global and diverse nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty will arise from time to time in addition subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessments and estimates of loss contingencies recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments in excess of our reserves which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

if we do not or cannot adequately protect our intellectual property if third parties infringe our intellectual property rights or if third parties claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights we may suffer competitive injury expend significant resources enforcing our rights or defending against such claims or be prevented from selling products or services 

we own numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others which in aggregate are important to our business the intellectual property rights that we obtain however may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage because they may not be sufficiently broad or may be challenged invalidated circumvented independently developed or designedaround particularly in countries where intellectual property rights laws are not highly developed protected or enforced our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we receive notices from third parties alleging intellectual property infringement or misappropriation any dispute or litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation in addition as a result of such claims of infringement or misappropriation we could lose our rights to critical technology be unable to license critical technology or sell critical products and services be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights or be required to redesign our products at substantial cost any of which could adversely impact our competitive position financial condition and results of operations even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation we may incur significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

a significant number of our products in our sensus segment are affected by the availability and regulation of radio spectrum and could be affected by interference with the radio spectrum that we use 

a significant number of the products in our sensus segment use radio spectrum which is subject to government regulation to the extent we introduce new products designed for use in the united states or another country into a new market such products may require significant modification or redesign in order to meet frequency requirements and other regulatory specifications in some countries limitations on frequency availability or the cost of making necessary modifications may preclude us from selling our products in those countries the regulations that govern our use of the radio spectrum may change and that the changes may require us to modify our products either directly or due to interference caused by new consumer products allowed under the regulations the inability to modify our products to meet such requirements the possible delays in completing such modifications and the cost of such modifications all could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in the united states our products are primarily designed to use licensed spectrum in the 900mhz range if the federal communications commission “fcc” did not renew our existing spectrum licenses our business could be adversely affected in addition there may be insufficient available frequencies in some markets to sustain or develop our planned operations at a commercially feasible price or at all 

outside of the united states certain of our products require the use of radio frequency and are subject to regulations in some jurisdictions radio station licenses may be granted for a fixed term and must be periodically renewed our advanced and smart metering systems typically transmit to and receive information from if applicable handheld mobile or fixed network reading devices in licensed bands made available to us through strategic partnerships and are reliant to some extent on the licensed spectrum continuing to be available through our partners or our customers we may be unable to find partners or customers that have access to sufficient frequencies in some markets to sustain or develop our planned operations or to find partners or customers that have access to sufficient frequencies in the relevant markets at a commercially feasible price or at all 

we may incur impairment charges for our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets which would negatively impact our operating results 

we have a significant amount of goodwill and purchased intangible assets on our balance sheet as a result of acquisitions we have completed as of december 31 2016  the net carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets totaled approximately  3 billion the carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of an acquired business in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date the carrying value of indefinitelived intangible assets represents the fair value of trademarks and trade names as of the acquisition date we do not amortize goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets that we expect to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows but instead we evaluate these assets for impairment at least annually or more frequently if interim indicators suggest that a potential impairment could exist in testing for impairment we will make a qualitative assessment and if we believe that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the quantitative twostep goodwill impairment test is required significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets divestitures and market capitalization declines may impair our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets any charges relating to such impairments could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we cannot make assurances that we will pay dividends on our common stock or continue to repurchase our common stock under board approved share repurchase plans and likewise our indebtedness could limit our ability to pay dividends or make share repurchases 

the timing declaration amount and payment of future dividends to our shareholders fall within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on many factors including our financial condition results of operations and capital requirements as well as applicable law regulatory constraints industry practice and other business considerations that our board of directors considers relevant there can be no assurance that we will pay a dividend in the future or continue to pay dividends 

further the timing and amount of the repurchase of our common stock under board approved share repurchase plans has similar dependencies as the payment of dividends and accordingly there can be no assurances that we will continue to repurchase our common stock 

additionally if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our debt payment obligations then our ability to pay dividends if so determined by the board of directors or make share repurchases will be impaired and we may be required to attempt to restructure or refinance our debt raise additional capital or take other actions such as selling assets reducing or delaying capital expenditures reducing our dividend or delaying or curtailing share repurchases there can be no assurance however that any such actions could be effected on satisfactory terms if at all or would be permitted by the terms of our debt or our other credit and contractual arrangements 

unforeseen environmental issues could impact our financial position or results of operations 

our operations are subject to and affected by many federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations in addition we could be affected by future environmental laws or regulations including for example those imposed in response to climate change concerns compliance with current and future environmental laws and regulations currently requires and is expected to continue to require operating and capital expenditures 

environmental laws and regulations may authorize substantial fines and criminal sanctions as well as facility shutdowns to address violations and may require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit emissions or discharges we also incur and expect to continue to incur costs to comply with current environmental laws and regulations 

developments such as the adoption of new environmental laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations violations by us of such laws and regulations discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination litigation involving environmental impacts our inability to recover costs associated with 

any such developments or financial insolvency of other responsible parties could in the future have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 

the level of returns on postretirement benefit plan assets changes in interest rates and other factors could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods 

certain members of our current and retired employee population are covered by pension and other employeerelated defined benefit plans collectively postretirement benefit plans we may experience significant fluctuations in costs related to our postretirement benefit plans as a result of macroeconomic factors such as interest rates that are beyond our control the cost of our postretirement plans is incurred over long periods of time and involves factors and uncertainties during those periods which can be volatile and unpredictable including rates of return on postretirement benefit plan assets discount rates used to calculate liabilities and expenses and rates of future compensation increases management develops each assumption using relevant plan and company experience and expectations in conjunction with marketrelated data our liquidity financial position including shareholders’ equity and results of operations could be materially affected by significant changes in key economic indicators actuarial experience financial market volatility future legislation and other governmental regulatory actions 

we make contributions to fund our postretirement benefit plans when considered necessary or advantageous to do so the macroeconomic factors discussed above including the return on postretirement benefit plan assets and the minimum funding requirements established by local government funding or taxing authorities or established by other agreement may influence future funding requirements a significant decline in the fair value of our plan assets or other adverse changes to our overall pension and other employeerelated benefit plans could require us to make significant funding contributions and affect cash flows in future periods 

the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly 

we cannot predict the prices at which our common stock may trade the market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely depending on many factors some of which may be beyond our control including 

 stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents and indiana law could delay or prevent a change in control 

certain provisions of our third amended and restated articles of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may delay or prevent a merger or acquisition of part or all of our business operations for example our articles of incorporation and our bylaws among other things require advance notice for shareholder proposals and nominations in addition our articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock these provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals of our business operations or delay or prevent a change in control which could harm our stock price indiana law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 10 or more of our outstanding common stock and us 

in connection with our spinoff itt now itt llc and exelis acquired by harris inc will indemnify us for certain liabilities and we will indemnify itt now itt llc or exelis for certain liabilities if we are required to indemnify itt now itt llc or exelis we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations and our financial results could be negatively impacted in the case of itts or exeliss indemnity there can be no assurance that those indemnities will be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of such liabilities or as to itts or exeliss ability to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future 

pursuant to the distribution agreement and certain other agreements with itt now itt llc and exelis itt now itt llc and exelis agreed to indemnify us from certain liabilities and we agreed to indemnify itt now itt llc and exelis for certain liabilities indemnities that we may be required to provide itt now itt llc and exelis may be significant and could negatively impact our business particularly indemnities relating to our actions that could impact the taxfree nature of the spinoff third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that itt now itt llc or exelis has agreed to retain further there can be no assurance that the indemnities from itt now itt llc and exelis will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities or that itt now itt llc and exelis will be able to fully satisfy their indemnification obligations moreover even if we ultimately were to succeed in recovering from itt now itt llc and exelis any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves each of these risks could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition

 key performance indicators and nongaap measures 

management reviews key performance indicators including revenue gross margin segment operating income and margins earnings per share orders growth working capital and backlog among others in addition we consider certain nongaap or adjusted measures to be useful to management and investors evaluating our operating performance for the periods presented and to provide a tool for evaluating our ongoing operations liquidity and management of assets this information can assist investors in assessing our financial performance and measures our ability to generate capital for deployment among competing strategic alternatives and initiatives including but not limited to dividends acquisitions share repurchases and debt repayment excluding revenue xylem provides guidance only on a nongaap basis due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting certain amounts that would be included in gaap earnings such as discrete tax items without unreasonable effort these adjusted metrics are consistent with how management views our business and are used to make financial operating and planning decisions these metrics however are not measures of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered a substitute for revenue operating income net income earnings per share basic and diluted or net cash from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap we consider the following nongaap 

measures which may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies to be key performance indicators

executive summary 

xylem reported revenue of 3771 million for 2016  an increase of 118 million or 32 from 3653 million reported in 2015  revenue increased 53 on a constant currency basis due to increased revenue of 163 million from acquisitions and organic revenue growth of 29 million driven primarily by a robust public utility end market and a relatively stable commercial business 

operating income for 2016 was 406 million  reflecting a decrease of 43 million or 96 compared to 449 million in 2015  operating margin was 108 for 2016 versus 123 for 2015 a decrease of 150 basis points this decrease in operating income was primarily due to sensus acquisition related costs of 53 million increases in restructuring and realignment costs of 27 million and increases in special charges of 4 million excluding these costs adjusted operating income was 511 million with an adjusted operating margin of 136 reflecting an increase of 41 million or 87 and 70 basis points respectively as compared with 2015 adjusted operating income of 470 million adjusted operating margin of 129 this increase in adjusted operating income was driven by strong progress in our productivity initiatives and cost reductions which more than offset cost inflation spending on strategic investments and unfavorable mix 

additional financial highlights for 2016 include the following 



2017 business outlook 

we anticipate total revenue growth in the range of 20 to 22 in 2017 with organic revenue growth in the lowsingledigits and sensus contributing the additional revenue growth the following is a summary of our outlook by end market 

 we will continue to strategically execute restructuring and realignment actions primarily to reposition our european and north american business in an effort to optimize our cost structure and improve our operational efficiency and effectiveness during 2016 we incurred 30 million and 17 million in restructuring and realignment costs respectively as a result of these actions in 2016 we realized 10 million of net savings and expect to realize approximately 24 million of incremental net savings in 2017 during 2017 we currently expect to incur approximately 30 million in sensus integration restructuring and realignment costs 

additional strategic actions we are taking include strategic initiatives to drive abovemarket growth advance continuous improvement activities to increase productivity focus on improving cash performance and drive a disciplined capital deployment strategy additionally with the acquisition of sensus we anticipate increased spending on research and development as a percentage of revenue as sensus brings a higher profile of rd given the investment required to support growth and new product launches

2016 versus 2015 

revenue 

revenue generated for 2016 was 3771 million  an increase of 118 million  or 32  compared to 3653 million in 2015  on a constant currency basis revenue grew 53  this increase in revenue was primarily driven by additional revenue of  163 million from acquisitions additionally we had strong organic growth driven by strength within the public utility industrial and commercial end markets in western europe particularly in the united kingdom as well as large project deliveries in emerging markets including india and asia partially offsetting this growth were declines in the united states primarily due to ongoing weakness in the industrial end market 

the following table illustrates the impact on 2016 revenue from organic growth recent acquisitionsdivestitures and foreign currency translation in relation to revenue 





water infrastructure 

water infrastructure’s revenue increased 15 million  or 07 in 2016  31 increase on a constant currency basis compared to 2015  the constant currency increase included organic growth of 38 million or 17  and contributions from acquisitions of 32 million 

organic growth in our treatment and transport applications primarily reflect increases in the public utility end market where we have been gaining share organic growth in the transport application in the public utility end markets in the united states and india was largely offset by declines in the industrial dewatering business in the united states due to continued challenges in the oil and gas market as well as weakness in the middle east driven by slower government funding organic growth in the treatment application was driven primarily by strong backlog execution and project deliveries in the united states public utility market revenue from test applications declined mainly due to weakness in the united states primarily as a result of lower government agency spending and weakness in the mining and oil and gas markets 

applied water 

applied water’s revenue decreased 29 million  or 20 in 2016  06 decrease on a constant currency basis compared to 2015 the decline on a constant currency basis was entirely attributable to organic revenue decline of 9 million or 06 which was driven by declines in the united states partially offset by growth in western europe and to a lesser extent the emerging markets 

from an applications perspective the decrease in organic revenue was predominately due to declines in the united states across all applications particularly industrial water which saw continued weakness in the oil and gas markets these declines were partially offset by strength in western europe due to several large projects combined with strength in commercial building services as well as general industrial applications agricultural applications declined in the united states primarily due to market weakness 

sensus 

the sensus segment which we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2016 generated 132 million revenue during the final two months of the year over 70 of the sensus revenue was generated in the united states with additional revenue coming primarily from western europe and china over half of the sensus revenue was generated from water applications with most of the remainder coming from electric and gas applications 

ordersbacklog 

orders received during 2016 increased by 113 million  or 30 to  3824 million  51 increase on a constant currency basis the order growth on a constant currency basis was primarily made up of orders from recent acquisitions primarily sensus of 179 million and organic order growth of 12 million or 03 over the prior year 

water infrastructure segment orders decreased 24 million  or 10 to 2272 million  15 growth on a constant currency basis the order growth on a constant currency basis was primarily orders from recent acquisitions of 32 million as well as organic order growth of 2 million or 01  organic orders for the treatment application increased by 5 over the prior year reflecting continued growth in the public utility market with a large ozone project in china and order increases in europe however these orders are largely project based with longer lead times for delivery and recognition of revenue largely offsetting the organic order growth in the treatment application were declines in the transport application primarily due to decreased dewatering orders impacted by the continued weakness in oil and gas as well as mining which were partially offset by public utility water and wastewater transport order strength in europe particularly in the nordic region organic orders from test applications were flat versus the prior year 

orders decreased in our applied water segment by 10 million  or 07 to 1405 million  07 increase on a constant currency basis the order increase on a constant currency basis was due to organic order growth of 07 driven by strength in europe from new product launches that was partially offset by weakness in the united states 

the sensus segment had orders of 147 million for the last two months of 2016 

delivery schedules vary from customer to customer based upon their requirements typically large projects require longer lead production cycles and delays can occur from time to time total backlog was 1078 million at december 31 2016 and 716 million at december 31 2015  this increase is primarily attributable to sensus who had a backlog balance of 385 million at december 31 2016 we anticipate that approximately 70 of our total backlog at december 31 2016 will be recognized as revenue during 2017  backlog includes contractual customer commitments as well as purchase orders on hand as of the end of the period 

gross margin 

gross margins as a percentage of consolidated revenue increased to 387 in 2016 from 384 in 2015  the gross margin increase was primarily due to the benefits realized from cost saving initiatives through global sourcing and lean six sigma partially offset by material and labor inflation headwinds and unfavorable currency impacts and mix 

operating expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses 

sga increased by 61 million increase of 71  to 243 of revenue in 2016  as compared to 234 of revenue in 2015  the increase in sga expenses includes 28 million of sensus acquisition related costs the remaining increases in sga expenses were primarily due to additional operating expenses from recent acquisitions investments in regional sales channels and operational capabilities and inflation which were partially offset by savings from restructuring and other cost actions 

research and development expenses 

rd spending increased 15 million or 158 to 29 of revenue in 2016 as compared to 26 of revenue in 2015 primarily due to additional rd spend from our recent acquisitions and investments in new products and technologies 

restructuring charges 

during 2016  we incurred restructuring costs of 17 million  10 million  1 million and 2 million in our water infrastructure applied water sensus and corporate and other segments respectively these charges were incurred primarily in an effort to realign our organizational structure in europe and north america to optimize our cost structure including shutting down certain facilities the charges relate to the reduction in structural costs including a decrease in headcount and consolidation of facilities during 2015  we recognized restructuring costs of  5 million and 1 million in our water infrastructure and applied water segments respectively these charges were incurred primarily in an effort to realign our organizational structure in europe and north america to optimize our cost structure the charges relate to the reduction in structural costs including a decrease in headcount and consolidation of facilities 

approximate total expected costs associated with actions that commenced during 2016 are 19 million for water infrastructure 13 million for applied water 2 million for sensus and 2 million for corporate these costs primarily comprise severance charges the water infrastructure and applied water actions are expected to continue through the end of 2017 the sensus actions are expected to continue through 2018 all of the costs associated with the corporate actions have been incurred as a result of these actions initiated in 2016 we achieved savings of approximately 8 million in 2016 and estimate annual future net savings beginning in 2017 of approximately 29 million resulting in 21 million of incremental savings from the 2016 actions 

operating income 

we generated operating income of 406 million during 2016  reflecting a decrease of 43 million or 96 from  449 million during the prior year operating income as a percentage of revenue was 108 for 2016 versus 123 for 2015 a decrease of 150 basis points this decrease in operating margin was primarily due to sensus acquisition related costs of 53 million increases in restructuring and realignment costs of 27 million and increases in special charges of 4 million excluding these costs adjusted operating income was 511 million with an adjusted operating margin of 136 reflecting an increase of 41 million or 87 and 70 basis points respectively as compared with 2015 adjusted operating income of 470 million adjusted operating margin of 129 this increase in adjusted operating income was driven by strong progress in our productivity initiatives and cost saving 

actions which more than offset cost inflation spending on strategic investments in new products and technologies and unfavorable mix 

the table below provides a reconciliation of the total and each segments operating income to adjusted operating income and a calculation of the corresponding adjusted operating margin 



nm not meaningful 

water infrastructure 

operating income for our water infrastructure segment increased 5 million or 17  with operating margin also increasing slightly from 136 to 137  a 10 basis point increase as compared to the prior year operating margin was negatively impacted by a 15 million increase in restructuring and realignment costs excluding restructuring and realignment costs adjusted operating income increased 24 million or 76  with adjusted operating margin increasing from 142 to 152  a 90 basis point increase as compared to the prior year the increase in adjusted operating margin was due to global procurement and continuous improvement initiatives which more than offset cost inflation and increased spending in growth initiatives 

applied water 

operating income for our applied water segment decreased 2 million or 11  with operating margin increasing slightly from 134 to 135  operating margin was negatively impacted by increased restructuring and realignment costs of 9 million excluding restructuring and realignment costs adjusted operating income increased 7 million or 36  with adjusted operating margin increasing from 139 to 146  a 60 basis point increase as compared to the prior year the increase in adjusted operating margin was due to global procurement and productivity gains which more than offset cost inflation strategic investments and unfavorable mix 

sensus 

sensus had an operating loss of 17 million for the last two months of 2016 this operating loss included 25 million of sensus acquisition related costs and 1 million of restructuring charges excluding these costs adjusted operating income was 9 million 

corporate and other 

operating loss for corporate and other increased 29 million or 659 decreased 1 million or 23 on an adjusted basis compared to the prior year primarily due to  28 million of sensus acquisition related costs and increased restructuring costs of 2 million 

interest expense 

interest expense was 70 million and 55 million for 2016 and 2015  respectively primarily related to interest on our senior notes including a makewhole interest premium of 7 million that was paid in the second quarter of 2016 and fees of 5 million related to the bridge facility entered into for the sensus acquisition see note 13  “credit facilities and longterm debt” for further details 

income tax expense 

the income tax provision for 2016 was 80 million at an effective tax rate of 235 compared to 63 million at an effective tax rate of 156 in 2015  the 2016 effective tax rate is higher than 2015 due to an increase in valuation allowance and impact of repatriation of foreign earnings offset by a favorable settlement with the tax authorities 

other comprehensive loss income 

other comprehensive loss before tax of 57 million in 2016 as compared to 130 million loss in 2015 was primarily due to foreign currency translation loss of  65 million in 2016 compared to a loss of  180 million for 2015 contributing to this decreased loss was a lower translation loss of 115 million primarily due to less weakening of the swedish krona and the canadian dollar against the us dollar partially offset by the additional weakening of the euro and the great british pound against the us dollar additionally there were net investment hedges in place that more than offset the weakening of the euro against the us dollar contributing a net euro gain into comprehensive income in 2016 other items offsetting the lower translation loss of 115 million were net changes in postretirement benefit plan gainslosses of 43 million 

2015 versus 2014 

revenue 

revenue generated for 2015 was 3653 million a decrease of 263 million or 67 compared to 3916 million in 2014 on a constant currency basis revenue grew 13 this increase included strong organic revenue growth within emerging markets particularly in china and india the united states and western europe also grew organically which was partially offset by declines in canada in addition the organic growth was partially offset by the divestiture of the wolverhampton valves business early in the third quarter of 2014 

the following table illustrates the impact on 2015 revenue from organic growth recent acquisitionsdivestitures and foreign currency translation in relation to revenue 



 water infrastructure 

water infrastructure’s revenue decreased 211 million or 86 in 2015 09 increase on a constant currency basis compared to 2014 the constant currency increase consisted of organic growth of 22 million or 09 driven by continued strength in the public utility end market partially offset by weakness in the industrial market the industrial market performance decline was due to decreases in dewatering applications in the oil and gas market which more than offset increases in the balance of the industrial market 

from an application perspective organic revenue grew in transport treatment and test applications the organic revenue growth from transport applications was predominately due to public utility strength in the emerging markets the united states and in western europe partially offset by declines in industrial dewatering applications from weakness in the oil and gas market in canada and the united states the organic revenue growth from treatment applications was due to ozone and filtration projects in china and australia which was somewhat offset by the lapping of a large project in latin america in 2014 and general weakness in europe organic revenue growth from test applications was driven by growth in china and india due to demand for new wastewater and river monitoring products 

applied water 

applied water’s revenue decreased 52 million or 35 in 2015 a 18 increase on a constant currency basis compared to 2014 the growth on a constant currency basis consisted of organic revenue growth of 38 million or 26 which was partially offset by the absence of 11 million in revenue from the divested wolverhampton valves business the increase in organic revenue was due to strength in the commercial industrial water and residential end markets partially offset by declines in the agriculture end market 

from an applications perspective the increase in organic revenue was predominately due to continued growth in commercial building services from a recovering institutional building sector in the united states and strength in asia the industrial water application organic revenue grew from project strength in western europe and the united states which was partially offset by the aforementioned wolverhampton divestiture residential building services organic revenue increased primarily in the united states due to improvements in the home construction market and market share gain irrigation applications organic revenue decline was largely impacted by severe flooding conditions in the southeast and southwest regions of the united states and the lapping of a strong fourth quarter in 2014 

ordersbacklog 

orders received during 2015 decreased by 310 million or 77 to 3711 million a 02 increase on a constant currency basis organic order growth increased 19 million or 05 for the year 

water infrastructure segment orders decreased 215 million or 86 to 2296 million 10 growth on a constant currency basis organic order growth of 10 was predominantly due to organic order increases for treatment applications due to large projects in the middle east and greater asia the organic orders for test applications were slightly up slightly offsetting these increases was a decline in organic orders for transport applications 

predominately due to decreases in the dewatering transport application due to weakness in the oil and gas market which more than offset solid growth in the remainder of the transport applications 

orders decreased in our applied water segment 95 million or 63 to 1415 million 10 decline on a constant currency basis the order decline on a constant currency basis was due to the organic order volume decrease of 03 due to market softness in the oil and gas and agricultural markets as well as the absence of orders from our wolverhampton valves divestiture 

delivery schedules vary from customer to customer based upon their requirements typically large projects require longer lead production cycles and delays can occur from time to time total backlog was 716 million at december 31 2015 and 740 million at december 31 2014 this decrease is due to foreign currency translation impacts 

gross margin 

gross margins as a percentage of consolidated revenue declined to 384 in 2015 from 386 in 2014 the gross margin decline was primarily due to negative currency translation impacts excluding the negative currency translation impacts gross margin was slightly higher as compared to 2014 benefits realized from cost saving initiatives through global sourcing and lean six sigma as well as increased volume more than offset material and labor inflation headwinds and unfavorable sales mix primarily due to higher volume sold to the emerging markets 

operating expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses 

sga decreased by 66 million or 72 to 234 of revenue in 2015 as compared to 235 of revenue in 2014 the decrease in sga expenses as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to currency translation impacts additionally cost inflation was offset by cost savings from continuous improvement initiatives and restructuring actions as well as reduced realignment costs 

research and development expenses 

rd spending decreased 9 million or 87 to 26 of revenue in 2015 as compared to 27 of revenue in 2014 primarily due to currency translation impacts 

restructuring charges 

during 2015 we incurred restructuring costs of 5 million and 1 million in our water infrastructure and applied water segments respectively these charges were incurred primarily in an effort to realign our organizational structure in europe and north america to optimize our cost structure the charges relate to the reduction in structural costs including a decrease in headcount and consolidation of facilities during 2014 we recognized restructuring costs of 19 million 6 million and 1 million in our water infrastructure and applied water segments and corporate and other respectively these charges were incurred primarily in an effort to realign our organizational structure in europe and north america to optimize our cost structure the charges relate to the reduction in structural costs including a decrease in headcount and consolidation of facilities 

total costs associated with actions that commenced during 2015 were 5 million for water infrastructure and 1 million for applied water these costs primarily comprise severance charges as a result of these actions initiated in 2015 we achieved savings of approximately 2 million in 2015 and annual net savings beginning in 2016 of approximately 3 million resulting in 1 million of incremental savings in 2016 from the 2015 actions 

operating income 

we generated operating income of 449 million during 2015 a 14 million or 30 decrease from the prior year operating income as a percentage of revenue was 123 for 2015 versus 118 for 2014 an increase of 50 basis 

points this increase in operating margin was primarily due to reduced restructuring and realignment costs incremental cost savings from continuous improvement initiatives and slightly higher volume partially offsetting these actions were cost inflation unfavorable mix and unfavorable foreign exchange translation impacts 

the following table illustrates operating income results for our business segments 

the table below provides a reconciliation of the total and each segments operating income to adjusted operating income and a calculation of the corresponding adjusted operating margin 

nm not meaningful 

water infrastructure 

operating income for our water infrastructure segment decreased 18 million or 56 while operating margin increased from 131 to 136 over the prior year contributing to the increase in operating margin was a reduction of 16 million in restructuring and realignment costs excluding restructuring and realignment costs and special charges adjusted operating margin decreased 33 million or 94 with adjusted operating margin decreasing from 143 to 142 compared to the prior year the reduction in adjusted operating margin was due to cost inflation and unfavorable mix resulting from the declines in our dewatering business driven by oil and gas weakness and lower emerging market margins this was partially offset by cost savings from procurement initiatives lean six sigma initiatives and restructuring actions 

applied water 

operating income for our applied water segment decreased 3 million or 16 with operating margin increasing from 131 to 134 compared to the prior year contributing to the increase in operating margin was a reduction of 7 million in restructuring and realignment costs excluding restructuring and realignment costs adjusted operating income decreased 9 million or 44 with adjusted operating margin decreasing from 140 to 139 the reduction in adjusted operating margin was due to cost inflation unfavorable mix and foreign exchange impacts partially offset by cost reductions from procurement and lean six sigma initiatives and higher volume 

corporate and other 

operating loss for corporate and other decreased 7 million or 137 decreased 6 million or 120 on an adjusted basis compared to the prior year the reduction in operating loss was primarily due to reduced information technology and franchise tax costs as well as reduced restructuring and realignment costs 

interest expense 

interest expense was 55 million and 54 million for 2015 and 2014 respectively primarily related to interest expense on 12 billion aggregate principal amount of our senior notes refer to note 13 “credit facilities and longterm debt” for further details 

income tax expense 

the income tax provision for 2015 was 63 million at an effective tax rate of 156 compared to 84 million at an effective tax rate of 198 in 2014 the 2015 effective tax rate is lower than 2014 due primarily to geographic mix of earnings as well as a reduction in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits recorded 

other comprehensive loss income 

other comprehensive loss before tax of 130 million in 2015 as compared to 284 million loss in 2014 was primarily due to a 23 million net gain in postretirement benefit plans foreign currency in 2015 as compared to a net loss of 110 million for 2014 further contributing to this decreased loss was a lower translation loss of 26 million primarily due to less weakening of the euro against the us dollar largely offset by the additional weakening of the swedish krona against the us dollar additionally there was a release of 8 million of currency translation gains out of other comprehensive loss income recognized as part of gain from the sale of a business 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash 



sources and uses of liquidity 

operating activities 

during 2016  net cash provided by operating activities was 497 million  compared to 464 million in 2015  the 33 million yearoveryear increase was primarily driven by continued improvement in working capital levels the improvement in working capital includes significant contribution from the acquisition of sensus during the fourth quarter of 2016 which has positively impacted our working capital efficiency 

during 2015  net cash provided by operating activities was 464 million  compared to 416 million in 2014  the 48 million yearoveryear increase was primarily driven by a decrease in the use of working capital driven by improved inventory levels and improved collections of receivables lower payments for restructuring and postretirement benefit plans were more than offset by increased payments for foreign valueadded taxes as compared to the prior year 

investing activities 

cash used in investing activities was 1886 million in 2016  compared to 132 million in 2015  the increase of 1754 million was primarily due to 1782 million spent on the acquisition of sensus and two other businesses in 2016 as compared to 18 million in 2015 cash provided from other investing activities partially offset the usage 

cash used in investing activities was 132 million in 2015 compared to 86 million in 2014  the increase of 46 million was primarily due to 18 million spent on an acquisition in 2015 as compared cash received in 2014 of 30 million for the sale of our wolverhampton business 

financing activities 

cash generated by financing activities was 1034 million in 2016 in 2015 and 2014 financing activities used 262 million and 147 million of cash respectively in 2016 the net increase in cash provided was due to the issuance of long term and short term debt related to acquisition financing and a reduction in share repurchases this increase was partially offset by net repayments of short term debt see note 13 credit facilities and longterm debt of our consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of debt activities and higher dividend payments in 2015 the 115 million increase is primarily driven by an increase in share repurchase activity of 45 million and an increase of 8 million or a 10 per share increase in dividends paid to shareholders as well as a decrease in cash received from shortterm debt borrowings under the european investment bank facility of 50 million 

funding and liquidity strategy 

our ability to fund our capital needs depends on our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access to bank financing and the capital markets historically we have generated operating cash flow sufficient to fund our primary cash needs centered on operating activities working capital capital expenditures and strategic investments if our cash flows from operations are less than we expect we may need to incur debt or issue equity from time to time we may need to access the longterm and shortterm capital markets to obtain financing our access to and the availability of financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors including i our credit ratings or absence of a credit rating ii the liquidity of the overall capital markets and iii the current state of the economy there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or that such financing will be available at all 

we monitor our global funding requirements and seek to meet our liquidity needs on a cost effective basis based on our current global cash positions cash flows from operations and access to the commercial paper markets we believe there is sufficient liquidity to meet our funding requirements in addition our existing committed credit facilities and access to the public debt markets would provide further liquidity if required 

we anticipate that our present sources of funds including funds from operations and additional borrowings will provide us with sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet our liquidity and capital needs in both the united states and outside of the united states over the next twelve months 

credit facilities  longterm contractual commitments 

see note 13 credit facilities and longterm debt of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our credit facilities and longterm debt 

nonus operations 

for 2016 and 2015  we generated 58 and 59 of our revenue from nonus operations respectively while the addition of sensus will increase our revenue profile in the us we continue to grow our operations in the emerging markets and elsewhere outside of the united states as such we expect to continue to generate significant revenue 

from nonus operations and expect a substantial portion of our cash will be predominately held by our foreign subsidiaries we expect to manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed we may transfer cash from certain international subsidiaries to the us and other international subsidiaries when we believe it is cost effective to do so we continually review our domestic and foreign cash profile expected future cash generation and investment opportunities which support our current designation of a portion of these funds as being indefinitely reinvested and reassess whether there is a demonstrated need to repatriate funds held internationally to support our us operations if as a result of our review it is determined that all or a portion of the funds may be needed for our operations in the united states we may be required to accrue additional us taxes as of december 31 2016  our foreign subsidiaries were holding 242 million in cash or marketable securities 

as of december 31 2016  our excess of financial reporting over the tax basis of investments in certain foreign subsidiaries totaled 19 billion  we have not asserted that 81 million of our excess basis difference will be indefinitely reinvested and have therefore provided for us or additional foreign withholding taxes for that portion generally such amounts become subject to us taxation upon the remittance of dividends and under certain other circumstances 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual commitments as of december 31 2016  

in addition to the amounts presented in the table above we have recorded liabilities for uncertain tax positions of 67 million  net investment hedges of 6 million and employee severance indemnity of 13 million  these amounts have been excluded from the contractual obligations table due to an inability to reasonably estimate the timing or amounts of such payments in individual years further benefit payments which reflect expected future service related to the companys pension and other postretirement employee benefit obligations are presented in note 14  “postretirement benefit plans” of the consolidated financial statements and are not included in the above table finally estimated environmental payments and workers compensation and general liability reserves are excluded from the table above we estimate based on historical experience that we will spend approximately 1 million to 2 million per year on environmental investigation and remediation and approximately 6 million to 7 million per year on workers compensation and general liability at december 31 2016  we had estimated and accrued 4 million and 24 million related to environmental matters and workers compensation and general liability respectively 

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2016  we have issued guarantees for the debt and other obligations of consolidated subsidiaries in the normal course of business we have determined that none of these arrangements has a material current effect or is reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our consolidated financial statements financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

we obtain certain standby letters of credit bank guarantees and surety bonds from thirdparty financial institutions 

in the ordinary course of business when required under contracts or to satisfy insurance related requirements as of december 31 2016  the amount of standby letters of credit bank guarantees and surety bonds was 218 million  

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 

significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are discussed in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” of the consolidated financial statements accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they are inherently uncertain involve significant judgments include areas where different estimates reasonably could have been used and changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable however actual results in these areas could differ from management’s estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured for product sales delivery does not occur until the products have been shipped risk of loss has been transferred to the customer and the contractual terms have been fulfilled in instances where contractual terms include a provision for customer acceptance revenue is recognized when either i we have previously demonstrated that the product meets the specified criteria based on either seller or customerspecified objective criteria or ii upon formal acceptance received from the customer where the product has not been previously demonstrated to meet customerspecified objective criteria revenue on service and repair contracts is recognized after services have been agreed to by the customer and rendered 

we enter into contracts to sell our products and services and while the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions certain agreements contain multiple elements or nonstandard terms and conditions where sales agreements contain multiple elements or nonstandard terms and conditions judgment is required to determine the appropriate accounting including whether the deliverables specified in these agreements should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes and if so how the transaction price should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize revenue for each element when a sale involves multiple deliverables the total revenue from the arrangement is allocated to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price of the deliverable to all other deliverables in the contract revenue for multiple element arrangements is recognized when the appropriate revenue recognition criteria for the individual deliverable have been satisfied generally these elements are satisfied within the same reporting period although certain contracts may be completed over 6 months the allocation of sales price between elements may impact the timing of revenue recognition but will not change the total revenue recognized on the arrangement for delivered elements accounted for as separate units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement revenue is recognized only when the delivered elements have standalone value there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance and there are no customernegotiated refund or return rights affecting the sales recognized 

certain businesses enter into longterm constructiontype sales contracts for which revenue is recognized under the percentageofcompletion method based upon percentage of costs incurred to total estimated costs 

we record a reduction in revenue at the time of sale for estimated product returns rebates and other allowances based on historical experience and known trends 

we are currently evaluating the impact of the new accounting guidance regarding revenue from contracts with customers that is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 refer to note 2 “recently issued accounting pronouncements” at this point in our review process we do not believe that the new revenue guidance will have a material impact on our financial statements an evaluation of the impact of this guidance on the sensus business has not yet been performed 

income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities applying enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences will reverse based on the evaluation of available evidence we recognize future tax benefits such as net operating loss carryforwards to the extent that we believe it is more likely than not we will realize these benefits we periodically assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 

and reflect any changes to our estimate of the amount we are more likely than not to realize in the valuation allowance with a corresponding adjustment to earnings or other comprehensive income as appropriate 

in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we look to the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences taxable income in carryback years and the feasibility of tax planning strategies and estimated future taxable income the valuation allowance can be affected by changes to tax laws changes to statutory tax rates and changes to future taxable income estimates 

our effective tax rate reflects the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which we have not provided us taxes because we plan to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside the united states we plan foreign earnings remittance amounts based on projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and longterm investment requirements of our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic operations based on these assumptions we estimate the amount we will distribute to the united states and provide the us federal taxes due on these amounts material changes in our estimates of cash working capital and longterm investment requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we do business could impact our effective tax rate 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and to the extent to which additional taxes will be due furthermore we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

we adjust our liability for uncertain tax positions in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional tax expense would result if a payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 

business combinations we record acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting all of the assets acquired liabilities assumed contractual contingencies and contingent consideration is recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill the application of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in order to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill these assumptions and estimates include a market participant’s use of the asset and the appropriate discount rates for a market participant our estimates are based on historical experience information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and when appropriate includes assistance from independent thirdparty appraisal firms significant assumptions and estimates include but are not limited to the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future the cost to buildrecreate certain technology the appropriate weightedaverage cost of capital and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable in addition unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates 

goodwill and intangible assets we review goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable we also review the carrying value of our finitelived intangible assets for potential impairment when impairment indicators arise we conduct our annual impairment test as of the first day of the fourth quarter we perform a twostep impairment test for goodwill in the first step we compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds its fair value then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to measure the impairment loss to be recorded if any if the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value then we record an impairment loss equal to the difference in our annual impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets we compare the fair value of those assets to their carrying value we recognize an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying value we estimate the fair value of our reporting units and intangible assets with 

indefinite lives using an income approach under the income approach we calculate fair value based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinitelived intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions particularly related to future operating results and cash flows these estimates and assumptions include but are not limited to revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates assumed royalty rates future economic and market conditions and identification of appropriate market comparable data in addition the identification of reporting units and the allocation of assets and liabilities to the reporting units when determining the carrying value of each reporting unit also require judgment goodwill is tested for impairment at either the operating segment identified in note 20  “segment and geographic data” of the consolidated financial statements or one level below the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets is based on estimates and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable significant changes to these estimates and assumptions could adversely impact our conclusions actual future results may differ from those estimates 

during the fourth quarter of 2016  we performed our annual impairment assessment and determined that the estimated fair values of our goodwill reporting units were substantially in excess of each of their carrying values however future goodwill impairment tests could result in a charge to earnings we will continue to evaluate goodwill on an annual basis as of the beginning of our fourth quarter and whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate there may be a potential impairment we determined that no impairment of the indefinitelived intangibles existed as of the measurement date in 2016  

contingent liabilities as discussed in note 18  commitments and contingencies of the consolidated financial statements the company is from time to time subject to a variety of litigation environmental liabilities product liabilities and similar contingent liabilities incidental to its business or the business operations of previously owned entities the company recognizes a liability for any contingency that is known or probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable these assessments require judgments concerning matters such as litigation developments and outcomes the anticipated outcome of negotiations the number of future claims and the cost of both pending and future claims in addition because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time liabilities may change in the future due to various factors including those discussed in note 18 of the consolidated financial statements if the liabilities established by the company with respect to these contingencies are inadequate the company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the recorded liability which would adversely affect the company’s financial statements 

receivables and allowance for doubtful accounts and discounts receivables primarily comprise uncollected amounts owed to us from transactions with customers and are presented net of allowances for doubtful accounts and early payment discounts 

we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts using a combination of factors to reduce our trade receivable balances to their estimated net realizable amount we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a variety of factors including the length of time receivables are past due macroeconomic trends and conditions significant onetime events historical experience and the financial condition of customers in addition we record a specific reserve for individual accounts when we become aware of specific customer circumstances such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer’s operating results or financial position the past due or delinquency status of a receivable is based on the contractual payment terms of the receivable if circumstances related to the specific customer change we adjust estimates of the recoverability of receivables as appropriate we determine our allowance for early payment discounts primarily based on historical experience with customers 

credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is generally diversified due to the large number of entities comprising our customer base and their dispersion across many different geographical regions we perform ongoing credit evaluations of the financial condition of our thirdparty distributors resellers and other customers and require collateral such as letters of credit and bank guarantees in certain circumstances as of december 31 2016 and 2015 we do not believe we have any significant concentrations of credit risk 

postretirement plans company employees around the world participate in numerous defined benefit plans the determination of projected benefit obligations and the recognition of expenses related to these plans are dependent on various assumptions these major assumptions primarily relate to discount rates expected longterm rates of return on plan assets rate of future compensation increases mortality health care inflation and years of service some of which are disclosed in note 14  “postretirement benefit plans” of the consolidated financial statements and other factors actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized on a straightline basis only to the extent they exceed 10 of the higher of the marketrelated value or projected benefit obligation over the average remaining service period of active plan participants or for plans with all or substantially all inactive 

participants over the average remaining life expectancy 

significant assumptions 

management develops each assumption using relevant company experience in conjunction with marketrelated data for each individual country in which such plans exist all assumptions are reviewed annually with thirdparty consultants and adjusted as necessary the table included below provides the weighted average assumptions used to estimate our defined benefit pension obligations and costs as of and for the years ended 2016 and 2015  



 we determine the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets by evaluating both historical returns and estimates of future returns specifically the company analyzes the estimated future returns based on independent estimates of asset class returns and evaluates historical broad market returns over longterm timeframes based on the strategic asset allocation which is detailed in note 14  “postretirement benefit plans” of the consolidated financial statements 

based on the approach described above the chart below shows weighted average actual returns versus the weighted average expected longterm rates of return for our pension plans that were utilized in the calculation of the net periodic pension cost for each respective year 

for the recognition of net periodic pension cost the calculation of the expected return on plan assets is generally derived by applying the expected longterm rate of return to the marketrelated value of plan assets the marketrelated value of plan assets is based on average asset values at the measurement date over the last five years the use of fair value rather than a calculated value could materially affect net periodic pension cost the weighted average expected longterm rate of return for all of our plan assets to be used in determining net periodic benefit costs for 2017 is estimated at 730  we estimate that every 25 basis point change in the expected return on plan assets impacts the expense by 1 million 

the discount rate reflects our expectation of the present value of expected future cash payments for benefits at the measurement date a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense we base the discount rate assumption on current investment yields of highquality fixed income investments during the retirement benefits maturity period the pension discount rate was determined by considering an interest rate yield curve comprising aaaaa bonds with maturities between zero and 30 years developed by the plan’s actuaries annual benefit payments are then discounted to present value using this yield curve to develop a singlepoint discount rate matching the plan’s characteristics our weighted average discount rate for all pension plans effective january 1 2017  is 282  we estimate that every 25 basis point change in the discount rate impacts the expense by 1 million 

the rate of future compensation increase assumption reflects our longterm actual experience and future and nearterm outlook effective january 1 2017  our expected rate of future compensation is 280 for all pension plans the estimated impact of a 25 basis point change in the expected rate of future compensation is less than 1 million 

the assumed rate of future increases in the per capita cost of health care the health care trend rate is 814 for 2017  decreasing ratably to 450 in 2025 an increase or decrease in the health care trend rates by one percent per year would impact the aggregate annual service and interest components by less than 1 million and impact the benefit obligation by approximately 5 million 

we currently anticipate making contributions to our pension and postretirement benefit plans in the range of 20 million to 30 million during 2017  of which 6 million is expected to be made in the first quarter 

funded status 

funded status is derived by subtracting the respective yearend values of the projected benefit obligations from the fair value of plan assets we estimate that every 25 basis point change in the discount rate impacts the funded status by approximately 29 million 

fair value of plan assets 

the plan assets of our pension plans comprise a broad range of investments including domestic and foreign equity securities interests in private equity and hedge funds fixed income investments insurance contracts and cash and cash equivalents 

a portion of our pension benefit plan assets portfolio comprises investments in private equity and hedge funds the private equity and hedge fund investments are generally measured at net asset value however in certain instances the values reported by the asset managers were not current at the measurement date accordingly we made estimate adjustments to the last reported value where necessary to measure the assets at fair value at the measurement date these adjustments consider information received from the asset managers as well as general market information the adjustment recorded at december 31 2016 and 2015 for these assets represented less than one percent of total plan assets in each respective year asset values for other positions were generally measured using market observable prices we estimate that a 5 change in asset values will impact funded status by approximately 26 million

 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates these exposures are actively monitored by management our exposure to foreign exchange rate risk is due to certain costs revenue and borrowings being denominated in currencies other than one of our subsidiaries functional currency similarly we are exposed to market risk as the result of changes in interest rates which may affect the cost of our financing it is our policy and practice to use derivative financial instruments only to the extent necessary to manage exposures 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we conduct approximately 58 of our business in various locations outside the united states 

our economic foreign currency risk primarily relates to receipts from customers payments to suppliers and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies we may use derivative financial instruments to offset risk related to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers when it is believed that the exposure will not be limited by our normal operating and financing activities we enter into currency forward contracts periodically in order to manage the exchange rate fluctuation risk on certain intercompany transactions associated with third party sales and purchases these risks are also mitigated by natural hedges including the presence of manufacturing facilities outside the united states global sourcing and other spending which occurs in foreign countries our principal foreign currency transaction exposures primarily relate to the swedish krona polish zloty canadian dollar british pound and australian dollar we estimate that a hypothetical 10 movement in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material economic impact to xylem’s financial position and results of operations 

additionally we are subject to foreign exchange translation risk due to changes in the value of foreign currencies in relation to our reporting currency the us dollar the translation risk is primarily concentrated in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro british pound chinese yuan swedish krona canadian dollar and australian dollar as the us dollar strengthens against other currencies in which we transact business revenue and income will generally be negatively impacted and if the us dollar weakens revenue and income will generally be positively impacted we estimate that a hypothetical 10 movement of the us dollar to the various foreign currency exchange rates we translate from in the aggregate could have approximately a 5 and 8 impact on xylems consolidated revenue and income respectively as reported in us dollars we expect to continue to generate significant revenue from nonus operations and we expect our cash will be predominately held by our foreign subsidiaries we expect to manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed we may transfer cash from certain international subsidiaries to the us and other international subsidiaries when it is cost effective to do so though our intent is to indefinitely reinvest most of these funds outside of the us as such we do not expect translation risk to have a material economic impact on our financial position and results of operations 

interest rate risk 

as of december 31 2016  our long term debt portfolio is primarily comprised of four series of fixedrate senior notes that total 20 billion the senior notes are not exposed to interest rate risk as the bonds are at a fixedrate until maturity until the company closes the refinancing of the notes due we are exposed to interest rate risk that can potentially impact the planned issuance of debt instruments based on current interest rate market we do not anticipate material risk associated with our debt refinancing within the target timeframe of completion 

commodity price exposures 

portions of our business are exposed to volatility in the prices of certain commodities such as copper nickel and aluminum among others our primary exposure to this volatility resides with the use of these materials in purchased component parts we generally maintain longterm fixed price contracts on raw materials and component parts however we are prone to exposure as these contracts expire we estimate that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in prices for raw metal commodities would not be material to our financial position and results of operations

 item 1 business 

business overview 

xylem with 2015  revenue of 37 billion  and approximately 12700  employees is a world leader in the design manufacturing and application of highly engineered technologies for the water industry we are a leading equipment and service provider for water and wastewater applications with a broad portfolio of products and services addressing the full cycle of water from collection distribution and use to the return of water to the environment we have leading market positions among equipment and service providers in the core application areas of the water equipment industry transport treatment test building services industrial processing and irrigation our company’s brands such as bell  gossett and flygt are well known throughout the industry and have served the water market for many years 

we serve a global customer base across diverse end markets while offering localized expertise we sell our products in approximately 150 countries through a balanced distribution network consisting of our direct sales force and independent channel partners in 2015  59  of our revenue was generated outside the united states with 21  of revenue generated in emerging markets 

our industry 

our planet faces a serious water challenge less than 1 of the total water available on earth is fresh water and this percentage is declining due to factors such as the draining of aquifers increased pollution and climate change in addition demand for fresh water is rising rapidly due to population growth industrial expansion and increased agricultural development with consumption estimated to double every 20 years by 2025 more than 30 of the world’s population is expected to live in areas without adequate water supply even in developed countries with sufficient clean water supply existing infrastructure for water supply is aging and inadequately funded in the united states degrading pipe systems leak one out of every six gallons of water on average on its way from a treatment plant to the customer these challenges are driving opportunities for growth in the global water industry which we estimate to have a total market size of approximately 550 billion  we estimate our total served market size to be approximately 37 billion 

we view these challenges through the lens of water productivity water quality and resilience water productivity refers to the more efficient delivery and use of clean water water quality refers to the efficient and effective management of wastewater resilience refers to the management of waterrelated risks and the resilience of water infrastructure the company’s customers often face all three of these challenges ranging from inefficient aging water distribution networks which require increases in “water productivity” energyintensive or unreliable wastewater management systems which require increases in “water quality” or exposure to natural disasters such as floods or droughts which require increases in “resilience” delivering value in these areas creates significant opportunity for the company 

the water industry supply chain is comprised of equipment and services companies design and build service providers and utilities equipment and service providers serve distinct customer types the utilities supply water through an infrastructure network supply chain companies provide single or sometimes combined functions from equipment manufacturing and services to facility design engineering procurement and construction or “epc” firms to plant operations utilities as depicted below in figure 1 the utilities and epc customers are looking for technology and application expertise from their equipment and services providers to address trends such as rising pollution stricter regulations and the increased outsourcing of process knowledge the end users of water consist of a wide array of entities including farms mines power plants industrial facilities and residential homes these customers are predominately served through specialized distributors and original equipment manufacturers “oems” 

figure 1 water industry supply chain 

our business focuses on the beginning of the supply chain by providing technologyintensive equipment and services we sell our equipment and services via direct and indirect channels that serve the needs of each customer type on the utility side we provide the majority of our sales direct to customers with strong application expertise with the remaining amount going through distribution partners to end users of water we provide the majority of our sales through longstanding relationships with the world’s leading distributors with the remainder going direct to customers 

the equipment and services market addresses the key processes of the water industry which are best illustrated through the cycle of water as depicted in figure 2 below we believe this industry has two distinct sectors within the cycle of water water infrastructure and usage applications the key processes of this cycle begin when raw water is extracted by pumps which provide the necessary pressure and flow to move or transport this water from natural sources such as oceans groundwater lakes and rivers through pipes to treatment facilities treatment facilities can provide many forms of treatment such as filtration disinfection and desalination to remove solids bacteria and salt respectively throughout each of these stages analytical instruments test the water to ensure regulatory requirements are met so that it can be utilized by enduse customers a network of pipes and pumps again transports this clean water to where it is needed such as to crops for irrigation to power plants to provide cooling in industrial water or to an apartment building as drinking water in residential and commercial buildings after usage the wastewater is collected by a separate network of pipes and pumps and transported to a wastewater treatment facility where processes such as digestion deactivate and reduce the volume of solids and disinfection purifies effluent water once treated analytical instruments test the water to ensure regulatory requirements are met so that it can be discharged back to the environment thereby completing the cycle 

figure 2 cycle of water 

in the water infrastructure sector two primary end markets exist public utility and industrial the public utility market comprises public private and publicprivate institutions that handle water and wastewater for mostly residential and commercial purposes the industrial market involves the supply of water and removal of wastewater for industrial facilities we view the main macro drivers of this sector to be water quality the desire for energyefficient products water scarcity regulatory requirements and infrastructure needs for both the repair of aging systems in developed countries as well as new installations in emerging markets 

in the usage applications sector enduse customers fall into four main markets residential commercial industrial and agricultural homeowners represent the end users in the residential market owners and managers of properties such as apartment buildings retail stores institutional buildings restaurants schools hospitals and hotels are examples of end users in the commercial market the industrial market is wide ranging involving oems exploration and production firms and developers and managers of facilities operated by electrical power generators chemical manufacturers machine shops clothing manufacturers beverage dispensing and food processing firms and car washes the agricultural market end users are owners and operators of businesses such as crop and livestock farms aquaculture golf courses and other turf applications we believe population growth urbanization and regulatory requirements are the primary macro drivers of these markets as these trends drive the need for housing food community services and retail goods within growing city centers water reuse and conservation are driving the need for new technologies 

business strategy 

our strategy is to enhance shareholder value by providing distinctive solutions for our customers most important water productivity quality and resilience challenges enabling us to grow revenue organically and through strategic acquisitions as we streamline our cost structure key elements of our strategy are summarized below 

 

business segments 

we have two reportable business segments that are aligned with the cycle of water and the key strategic market applications they provide water infrastructure collection distribution return and applied water usage see note 20  “segment and geographic data” in our consolidated financial statements for financial information about segments and geographic areas 

the table and descriptions below provide an overview of our business segments 

water infrastructure 

water infrastructure involves the process that collects water from a source and distributes it to users and then returns the wastewater responsibly to the environment within the water infrastructure segment our pump systems transport water from oceans groundwater aquifers lakes rivers and seas from there our filtration ultraviolet uv and ozone systems provide treatment making the water fit for use after consumption our pump lift stations move the wastewater to treatment facilities where our mixers biological treatment monitoring and control systems provide the primary functions in the treatment process throughout each of these stages our analytical systems test the quality of water for consumption as well as for its return to nature water infrastructure serves its customers public utilities and industrial applications through three closely linked applications transport treatment and test of water and wastewater we estimate our served market size in this sector to be approximately 21 billion 

transport 

the transport application includes all of the equipment and services involved in the safe and efficient movement of water from sources such as oceans groundwater aquifers lakes rivers and seas to treatment facilities and then to users it also includes the movement of wastewater from the point of use to a treatment facility and then back into the environment finally the transport application also includes dewatering pumps equipment and services which provide the safe removal or draining of groundwater and surface water from a riverbed construction site or mine shaft and bypass pumping for the repair of aging public utility infrastructure as well as emergency water removal during severe weather events we offer a wide range of highly engineered products such as water and wastewater submersible pumps monitoring controls and application solutions we do not serve the market for lowervalue equipment such as pipes and fittings we primarily employ configuretoorder capabilities to maximize manufacturing and logistics efficiencies by producing high volumes of basic product configurations when we provide a configuretoorder solution we configure a standard product to our customers’ specifications to a lesser extent we provide engineertoorder products to meet the customization requirements of our customers this process requires that we apply our technical expertise and production capabilities to provide a nonstandard solution to the customer we believe our business is one of the largest players in this served market based on management estimates with operations on six continents we also have one of the world’s largest dewatering rental fleets our key brands for this application are flygt and godwin transport accounted for approximately 73  of our water infrastructure segment revenue in both 2015  and 2014  and 74 in 2013  

treatment 

the treatment application includes equipment and services that treat both water for consumption and wastewater to be returned responsibly to the environment or reused primary served markets include public utilities and industrial operations while there are several treatment solutions in the market today we focus on three basic treatment types i filtration systems ii disinfection systems iii biological treatment systems including mixers our key brands for this application are leopold wedeco sanitaire and flygt filtration uses gravitybased media filters and clarifiers to clean both water and wastewater leopold has been a worldwide leader in filtration for over 90 years wedeco offers chemicalfree and environmentally friendly disinfection systems both uv and ozone oxidation to treat public utility drinking water wastewater and industrial process water biological treatment systems are key to the treatment and mixing of solids in wastewater plants which are provided through our sanitaire and flygt brands we believe our business is one of the largest players in this served market based on management estimates treatment accounted for approximately 14  of our water infrastructure segment revenue in 2015  2014  and 2013

analytical instrumentation is used across most industries to ensure regulatory requirements are met growth in this market is primarily driven by increasing regulation of water and wastewater in north america europe and asia our served market is predominately focused on water and the environment for quality levels throughout the water infrastructure loop analytical systems are applied in three primary ways in the field in a facility laboratory or real time online monitoring in a treatment facility process we believe we have a leading position in this served market based on management estimates our key brands for this application are wtw and ysi test accounted for approximately 13  of our water infrastructure segment revenue in both 2015  and 2014  and 12 in 2013  

applied water 

applied water encompasses the uses of water since water is used to some degree in almost every aspect of human economic and environmental activity this segment has a significant number of applications and we participate in all major areas of water demand residential and commercial building services account for human and building consumption where we deliver water boosting systems for drinking heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac and fire protection systems industrial water applications account for water consumption activities that use pumps heat exchangers valves and controls to provide cooling to power plants and manufacturing facilities as well as circulation for food and beverage processing the remaining portion of global water use resides in irrigation applications examples of what we provide include boosting systems for farming irrigation pumps for dairy operations and rainwater reuse systems for small scale crop and turf irrigationwe estimate our served market size in this sector to be approximately 16 billion 

residential  commercial building services 

this business is defined by four primary uses of water in building services applications such as in residential homes and commercial buildings including offices hotels hospitals schools restaurants and malls the first application is in hvac where bell  gossett and lowara specialize in pumps and valves that are used in waterdriven heating and cooling systems along with heat exchangers valves and monitoring and control products that augment the system the second is the supply of potable water for consumption including drinking water and for hygienic purposes  the goulds water technology lowara and bell  gossett brands provide pumps and boosting systems utilized within buildings sourcing water from distribution networks or from wells the third application is wastewater removal with sump and sewage pumps provided by bell  gossett goulds water technology and lowara the fourth waterrelated building service area is fire protection where our ac fire pump brand supplies full pump systems for emergency fire suppression bell  gossett goulds water technology and lowara have continued to innovate focusing on providing industryleading energyefficient and intelligent pumps for the building services market many of these products are more efficient than competitive devices we believe our business is one of the largest players in this served market based on management estimates building services accounted for approximately 54  of our applied water segment revenue in 2015  53 in 2014  and 50 in 2013  

industrial water 

water is used in most industrial facilities to provide processing steps such as cooling heating cleaning and mixing our goulds water technology and lowara brands supply vertical multistage pumps to bring in source water or to boost pressure for purposes including water circulation through a manufacturing facility to cool machine tools our standard xchange brand delivers heat exchangers for combined heat and power applications within power generation plants we also service niche applications such as wine processing with jabsco brand flexible impeller pumps and waterbased detergent dispensing and water circulation for car washes served by flojet airoperated 

diaphragm and goulds water technology end suction pumps our boosting pumps are also increasingly being used in hydraulic fracturing applications we can support mines throughout exploration development and operation our wide range of durable pumps ensures reliability that minimizes risks maximizes uptime and delivers superior total cost of ownership across all these various end applications we believe our business is the second largest player in this served market based on management estimates industrial water accounted for approximately 40  of our applied water segment revenue in 2015  and 2014  and 43 in 2013  

irrigation 

the irrigation business consists of irrigationrelated equipment and services associated with bringing water from a source to a production plant or livestock facility including hoses sprinklers center pivot and drip irrigation systems we focus on the pumps and boosting systems that supply this ancillary equipment with water our goulds water technology brand brings mixed flow pumps and our flowtronex group specializes in equipment packaged solutions incorporating monitoring and controls to optimize energy efficiency in irrigation delivery our lowara brand also produces pumps for agricultural applications and irrigation for gardens and parks we believe we have a leading position in this served market based on management estimates irrigation accounted for approximately 6  of our applied water segment revenue in 2015  and 7 in 2014  and 2013

distribution training and end use 

water infrastructure provides the majority of its sales through direct channels with remaining sales through indirect channels and service capabilities both public utility and industrial facility customers increasingly require our teams’ global but locally proficient expertise to use our equipment in their specific applications several trends are increasing the need for this application expertise i the increase in type and amount of contaminants in water supply ii increasing environmental regulations iii the need to increase system efficiencies to optimize energy costs iv the retirement of a largely aging water industry workforce not systematically replaced at utilities and other end user customers and v the buildout of water infrastructure in the emerging markets 

in the applied water segment many enduse areas are widely different so specialized distribution partners are often preferred our commercial teams have built longstanding relationships around our brands in many of these industries through which we can continue to leverage new product and service applications revenue opportunities are balanced between oems and aftermarket customers our products in the applied water segment are sold 

through our global direct sales and strong indirect channels with the majority of revenue going through indirect channels we have longstanding relationships with many of the leading independent distributors in the markets we serve and we provide incentives to distributors such as specialized loyalty and training programs 

aftermarket parts and service 

during their lifecycle installed products require maintenance repair services and parts due to the harsh environments in which they operate we have many service centers around the world which employ service employees to provide aftermarket parts and services to our large installed base of customers service centers offer an array of integrated service solutions for the industry including preventive monitoring contract maintenance emergency field service engineered upgrades inventory management and overhauls for pumps and other rotating equipment 

depending on the type of product median lifecycles range from five years to over 50 years at which time they must be replaced many of our products are precisely selected and applied within a larger network of equipment driving a strong preference by customers and installers to replace them with the same exact brand and model when they reach the end of their lifecycle this dynamic establishes a large recurring revenue stream for our business 

supply and seasonality 

we have a global manufacturing footprint with production facilities in europe north america latin america and asia our inventory management and distribution practices seek to minimize inventory holding periods by striving to take delivery of the inventory and manufacturing as close as possible to the sale or distribution of products to our customers all of our businesses require various parts and raw materials of which the availability and prices may fluctuate parts and raw materials commonly used in our products include motors fabricated parts castings bearings seals nickel copper aluminum and plastics while we may recover some cost increases through operational improvements we are still exposed to some pricing risk we attempt to control costs through fixedpriced contracts with suppliers and various other programs such as our global procurement initiative 

our business relies on thirdparty suppliers contract manufacturing and commodity markets to secure raw materials parts and components used in our products we typically acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our materials requirements for most of our products we have existing alternate sources of supply or such sources are readily available 

we may experience price volatility or supply constraints for materials that are not available from multiple sources from time to time we acquire certain inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longerterm pricing commitments with vendors to improve the priority price and availability of supply there have been no raw material shortages that have had a significant adverse impact on our business as a whole 

our water infrastructure and applied water segments experience some modest level of seasonality in its business this seasonality is dependent on factors such as capital spending of customers as well as weather conditions including heavy flooding droughts and fluctuations in temperatures which can positively or negatively impact portions of our business 

customers 

our business is not dependent on any single customer or a few customers the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our water infrastructure or applied water segments or on the company as a whole no individual customer accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated 2015  2014  or 2013  revenue 

backlog 

delivery schedules vary from customer to customer based upon their requirements typically large projects require longer lead production cycles and delays can occur from time to time total backlog was 716 million  at december 31 2015  and 740 million  at december 31 2014  we anticipate that more than 81  of the backlog at december 31 2015  will be recognized as revenue during 2016  

competition 

given the highly fragmented nature of the water industry the water infrastructure segment competes with a large number of businesses competition in the water transport and treatment technologies markets focuses on product performance reliability and innovation application expertise brand reputation energy efficiency product life cycle cost timeliness of delivery proximity of service centers effectiveness of our distribution channels and price in the sale of products and services we benefit from our large installed base of pumps and complementary products which require maintenance repair and replacement parts due to the nature of the products and the conditions under which they operate timeliness of delivery quality and the proximity of service centers are important 

customer considerations when selecting a provider for aftermarket products and services as well as equipment rentals in geographic regions where we are locally positioned to provide a quick response customers have historically relied on us rather than our competitors for aftermarket products relating to our highly engineered and customized solutions our key competitors within the water infrastructure segment include ksb inc sulzer ltd evoqua water technologies and danaher corporation 

competition in the applied water segment focuses on brand equity application expertise product delivery and performance quality and price we compete by offering a wide variety of innovative and highquality products coupled with worldclass application expertise we believe our distribution through wellestablished channels and our reputation for quality significantly enhance our market position our ability to deliver innovative product offerings has allowed us to compete effectively to cultivate and maintain customer relationships and to serve and expand into many niche and new markets our key competitors within the applied water segment include grundfos wilo se pentair ltd and franklin electric co inc 

research and development 

research and development “rd” is a key foundation of our growth strategy and we focus on the design and development of products and application knowhow that anticipate customer needs and emerging trends our engineers are involved in new product development as well as improvement of existing products to increase customer value our businesses invest substantial resources for rd we anticipate we will continue to develop and invest in our rd capabilities to promote a steady flow of innovative highquality and reliable products and applications to further strengthen our position in the markets we serve we invested 95 million  104 million  and 104 million  in rd in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

we have rd and product development capabilities around the world rd activities are initially conducted in our technology centers located in conjunction with some of our major manufacturing facilities to ensure an efficient and robust development process we have several global technical centers and local development teams around the world where we are supporting global needs and accelerating the customization of our application expertise to local needs in some cases our rd activities are conducted at our piloting and testing facilities and at strategic customer sites these piloting and testing facilities enable us to serve our strategic markets in each region of the world 

intellectual property 

we generally seek patent protection for those inventions and improvements that we believe will improve our competitive position we believe that our patents and applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and improving our return on research and development investments while we own control or license a significant number of patents trade secrets proprietary information trademarks trade names copyrights and other intellectual property rights which in the aggregate are of material importance to our business management believes that our business as a whole as well as each of our core business segments is not materially dependent on any one intellectual property right or related group of such rights 

patents patent applications and license agreements expire or terminate over time by operation of law in accordance with their terms or otherwise as the portfolio of our patents patent applications and license agreements has evolved over time we do not expect the expiration of any specific patent to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

environmental matters and regulation 

our manufacturing operations worldwide are subject to many requirements under environmental laws in the united states the environmental protection agency and similar state agencies administer laws and regulations concerning air emissions water discharges waste disposal environmental remediation and other aspects of environmental protection such environmental laws and regulations in the united states include for example the federal clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act environmental requirements significantly affect our operations we have established an internal program to address compliance with applicable environmental requirements and as a result management believes that we are in substantial compliance with current environmental regulations 

while environmental laws and regulations are subject to change such changes can be difficult to predict reliably and the timing of potential changes is uncertain management does not believe based on current circumstances that compliance costs pursuant to such regulations will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations however the effect of future legislative or regulatory changes could be material to our financial condition or results of operations 

accruals for environmental matters are recorded on a sitebysite basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on current law and existing technologies it can be difficult to estimate reliably the final costs of investigation and remediation due to various factors our accrued liabilities for these environmental matters represent the best estimates related to the investigation and remediation of environmental media such as water soil soil vapor air and structures as well as related legal fees based upon the facts and circumstances as currently known to us these estimates and related accruals are reviewed quarterly and updated for progress of investigation and remediation efforts and changes in facts and legal circumstances liabilities for these environmental expenditures are recorded on an undiscounted basis we do not anticipate these liabilities will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations we cannot make assurances that other sites or new details about sites known to us that could give rise to environmental liabilities with such material adverse effects on us will not be identified in the future at december 31 2015  we had estimated and accrued 4 million  related to environmental matters 

employees 

as of december 31 2015  xylem had approximately 12700  employees worldwide we have more than 3700 employees in the united states of whom approximately 17 are represented by labor unions and in certain foreign countries some of our employees are represented by work councils we believe that our facilities are in favorable labor markets with ready access to adequate numbers of workers and believe our relations with our employees are good

 item 1a risk factors 

in evaluating our business each of the following risks should be carefully considered along with all of the other information in this report and in our other filings with the sec should any of these risks and uncertainties develop into actual events our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

risks related to operational and external factors 

failure to compete successfully in our markets could adversely affect our business 

we offer our products and services in competitive markets we believe the principal points of competition in our markets are product performance reliability and innovation application expertise brand reputation energy efficiency product life cycle cost timeliness of delivery proximity of service centers effectiveness of our distribution channels and price maintaining and improving our competitive position will require successful management of these factors including continued investment by us in manufacturing research and development engineering marketing customer service and support and our distribution networks we may not be successful in maintaining our competitive position our competitors may develop products that are superior to our products or may develop more efficient or effective methods of providing products and services or may adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies or evolving customer requirements pricing pressures also could cause us to adjust the prices of certain products to stay competitive which could adversely affect our financial performance failure to continue competing successfully or to win large contracts could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by global economic and financial market conditions 

we compete around the world in various geographic and product markets in 2015  41  32  and 21  of our total revenue was from customers located in the united states europe and emerging markets respectively we expect revenue from these markets to be significant for the foreseeable future important factors impacting our businesses include the overall strength of these economies and our customers’ confidence in both local and global macroeconomic conditions industrial and federal state local and municipal governmental spending the strength of the residential and commercial real estate markets interest rates availability of commercial financing for our customers and endusers and unemployment rates a slowdown or prolonged downturn in financial or macroeconomic conditions in these areas or in the united states could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

economic and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our business 

in 2015  59  of our total revenue was from customers outside the united states with 21  of total revenue generated in emerging markets we expect our international operations sales and export sales to continue to be a significant portion of our revenue we have placed a particular emphasis on increasing our growth and presence in emerging markets both our sales from international operations and export sales are subject in varying degrees to risks inherent to doing business outside the united states these risks include the following 

 any payment of distributions loans or advances to us by our foreign subsidiaries could be subject to restrictions on or taxation of dividends on repatriation of earnings under applicable local law monetary transfer restrictions and foreign currency exchange regulations in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate in addition to the general risks that we face outside the united states we now conduct more of our operations in emerging markets than we have in the past which could involve additional uncertainties for us including risks that governments may impose limitations on our ability to repatriate funds governments may impose withholding or other taxes on 

remittances and other payments to us or the amount of any such taxes may increase an outbreak or escalation of any insurrection or armed conflict may occur governments may seek to nationalize our assets or governments may impose or increase investment barriers or other restrictions affecting our business in addition emerging markets pose other uncertainties including the difficulty of enforcing agreements challenges collecting receivables protection of our intellectual property and other assets pressure on the pricing of our products higher business conduct risks less qualified talent and risks of political instability we cannot predict the impact such future largely unforeseeable events might have on our business financial condition and results of operations 

failure to comply with laws regulations and policies including the us foreign corrupt practices act or other applicable anticorruption legislation could result in fines criminal penalties and an adverse effect on our business 

we are subject to regulation under a wide variety of us federal and state and nonus laws regulations and policies including laws related to anticorruption export and import compliance antitrust and money laundering due to our global operations the us foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa the uk bribery act of 2010 and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business there has been an increase in antibribery law enforcement activity in recent years with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the department of justice doj and the sec increased enforcement activity by nonus regulators and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from improper conduct of our employees or business partners in the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees or agents have or may have violated applicable laws including anticorruption laws we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management any such violation could result in substantial fines sanctions civil andor criminal penalties and curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions and might materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition in addition actual or alleged violations could damage our reputation and ability to do business furthermore detecting investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations is expensive and can consume significant time and attention of our senior management 

our business could be adversely affected by the inability of suppliers to meet delivery requirements 

our business relies on thirdparty suppliers contract manufacturing and commodity markets to secure raw materials parts and components used in our products parts and raw materials commonly used in our products include motors fabricated parts castings bearings seals nickel copper aluminum and plastics we are exposed to the availability of these materials which may be subject to curtailment or change due to among other things interruptions in production by suppliers labor disputes the impaired financial condition of a particular supplier suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels ability to meet regulatory requirements weather emergencies or acts of war or terrorism any delay in our suppliers’ abilities to provide us with necessary materials could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers and accordingly could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our business could be adversely affected by significant movements in foreign currency exchange rates 

we conduct approximately 59  of our business in various locations outside the united states we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency transaction exchange rates particularly with respect to the euro swedish krona canadian dollar british pound polish zloty and australian dollar any significant change in the value of currencies of the countries in which we do business relative to the value of the us dollar or euro could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations additionally we are subject to foreign exchange translation risk due to changes in the value of foreign currencies in relation to our reporting currency the us dollar the translation risk is primarily concentrated in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro british pound chinese yuan swedish krona canadian dollar and australian dollar as the us dollar fluctuates against other currencies in which we transact business revenue and income can be impacted for instance our 2015 revenue decreased by 80  due to unfavorable foreign currency impacts continued strengthening of the us dollar relative to the euro and the currencies of the other countries in which we do business could materially and adversely affect our revenue growth in future periods refer to item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information on foreign exchange risk 

weather conditions and climate changes may adversely affect or cause volatility toin our financial results 

weather conditions including heavy flooding droughts and fluctuations in temperatures or shifting conditions as a result of climate change can positively or negatively impact portions of our business within the dewatering space our pumps provided through our godwin and flygt brands are used to remove excess or unwanted water heavy flooding due to weather conditions drives increased demand for these applications on the other hand drought conditions drive higher demand for pumps used in agricultural and turf irrigation applications such as those provided by our goulds water technology flowtronex and lowara brands fluctuations to warmer and cooler temperatures result in varying levels of demand for products used in residential and commercial applications where homes and buildings are heated and cooled with hvac units such as those provided by our bg brand given the unpredictable nature of weather conditions and climate change this may result in volatility for certain portions of our business as well as the operations of certain of our customers and suppliers 

our financial results can be difficult to predict 

our business is impacted by an increasing amount of short cycle and bookandbill business which we have limited insight into particularly for the business that we transact through our distributors we are also impacted by large projects whose timing can change based upon customer requirements due to a number of factors affecting the project such as funding readiness of the project and regulatory approvals accordingly our financial results for any given period can be difficult to predict 

our strategy includes acquisitions and we may not be able to make acquisitions of suitable candidates or integrate acquisitions successfully 

our historical growth has included acquisitions as part of our growth strategy we plan to pursue the acquisition of other companies assets and product lines that either complement or expand our existing business we cannot make assurances however that we will be able to identify suitable candidates successfully negotiate appropriate acquisition terms obtain financing that may be needed to consummate those acquisitions complete proposed acquisitions successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or expand into new markets in addition we cannot make assurances that any acquisition once successfully integrated will perform as planned be accretive to earnings or prove to be beneficial to our operations or cash flow 

acquisitions involve a number of risks and present financial managerial and operational challenges including diversion of management attention from existing businesses and operations integration of technology operations personnel and financial and other systems potentially insufficient internal controls over financial activities or financial reporting at an acquired entity that could impact us on a combined basis the failure to realize expected synergies the possibility that we become exposed to substantial undisclosed liabilities or new material risks associated with the acquired businesses and the loss of key employees of the acquired businesses 

we may incur impairment charges for our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets which would negatively impact our operating results 

we have a significant amount of goodwill and purchased intangible assets on our balance sheet as a result of acquisitions we have completed as of december 31 2015  the net carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets totaled approximately 2 billion  the carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of an acquired business in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date the carrying value of indefinitelived intangible assets represents the fair value of trademarks and trade names as of the acquisition date we do not amortize goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets that we expect to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows but instead we evaluate these assets for impairment at least annually or more frequently if interim indicators suggest that a potential impairment could exist in testing for impairment we will make a qualitative assessment and if we believe that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the quantitative twostep goodwill impairment test is required significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets divestitures and market capitalization declines may impair our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets any charges relating to such impairments could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in the periods recognized 

we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring plans and our restructuring may adversely affect our business 

we have announced restructuring plans in an effort to reposition our european and north american businesses to optimize our cost structure and improve our operational efficiency and effectiveness we may not be able to obtain the cost savings and benefits that were initially anticipated in connection with our restructuring additionally as a 

result of our restructuring we may experience a loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge or inefficiency during transitional periods reorganization and restructuring can require a significant amount of management and other employees time and focus which may divert attention from operating and growing our business 

the successful implementation and execution of our restructuring and realignment actions is critical to achieving our expected cost savings as well as effectively competing in the marketplace factors that may impede a successful implementation is retention of key employees the impact of regulatory matters and adverse economic market conditions if the restructuring and realignment actions are not executed successfully it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in our effective tax rates may adversely affect our financial results 

we sell our products in more than 150 countries and 59  of our revenue was generated outside the united states in 2015  given the global nature of our business a number of factors may increase our future effective tax rates including 

 any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could reduce net income for future periods 

our business could be adversely affected by inflation and other manufacturing and operating cost increases 

our operating costs are subject to fluctuations particularly due to changes in commodity prices raw materials energy and related utilities freight and cost of labor in order to remain competitive we may not be able to recuperate all or a portion of these higher costs from our customers through product price increases further in a declining price environment our operating margins may contract because we account for inventory using the firstin first out method actions we take to mitigate volatility in manufacturing and operating costs may not be successful and as a result our business financial condition and results of operation could be materially and adversely affected 

product defects and unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure with respect to our products could adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements 

manufacturing or design defects in including in products or components that we source from third parties unanticipated use of or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of products there can be no assurance that we or our customers or other third parties will not experience operational process failures or other problems that could result in potential product safety regulatory or environmental risk which can lead to personal injury death or property damage these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products result in the removal of a product from the market and result in product liability claims being brought against us although we have liability insurance we cannot be certain that this insurance coverage will continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost or will be adequate to cover any product liability claims recalls removals and product liability claims can result in significant costs as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products 

our indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operational flexibility 

as of december 31 2015  our total outstanding indebtedness was 1274 million  including our 355 senior notes of 600 million aggregate principal amount due september 2016 and 4875 senior notes of 600 million aggregate principal amount due october 2021 we have an existing fiveyear competitive advance and revolving credit facility the “credit facility” which provides for an aggregate principal amount of up to 600 million we have a risk sharing finance facility agreement the rd facility agreement with the european investment bank eib in an aggregate principal amount of up to €120 million approximately 132 million 

our indebtedness could 

 16 

 in addition there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available to us on favorable terms or at all for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness if we incur additional debt or raise equity through the issuance of preferred stock the terms of the debt or preferred stock issued may give the holders rights preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock particularly in the event of liquidation the terms of the debt may also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on our operations than we currently have 

our ability to make scheduled principal payments of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance which may be affected by factors beyond our control if we are unable to service our indebtedness our business financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 

we may be negatively impacted by litigation and regulatory proceedings 

we are subject to laws regulations and potential liability relating to claims complaints and proceedings including those related to antitrust environmental product and other matters 

we are subject to various laws ordinances regulations and other requirements of government authorities in foreign countries and in the united states any violation of which could potentially create substantial liability for us and also damage to our reputation changes in laws ordinances regulations or other government policies the nature timing and effect of which are uncertain may significantly increase our expenses and liabilities 

from time to time we are involved in legal proceedings that are incidental to the operation of our businesses including acquisitions and divestitures some of these proceedings seek remedies relating to environmental matters intellectual property matters product liability and personal injury claims employment labor and pension matters and government and commercial or contract issues sometimes related to acquisitions or divestitures we may become subject to significant claims of which we are currently unaware or the claims of which we are aware may result in our incurring a significantly greater liability than we anticipate or can estimate additionally we may receive fines or penalties or be required to change or cease operations at one or more facilities if a regulatory agency determines that we have failed to comply with laws regulations or orders applicable to our business 

our business could be adversely affected by interruptions in information technology communications networks and operations or cybersecurity threats 

our business operations rely on information technology and communications networks and operations that are vulnerable to damage or disturbance from a variety of sources regardless of protection measures essentially all systems are susceptible to disruption due to failure vandalism computer viruses security breaches natural disasters power outages and other events in addition we and some of our third party vendors have experienced cybersecurity attacks in the past and may experience them in the future potentially with more frequency to date none have resulted in any material adverse impact to our business or operations we have adopted measures to mitigate potential risks associated with information technology disruptions and cybersecurity threats however given the unpredictability of the timing nature and scope of such disruptions we could potentially be subject to production downtimes operational delays other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information destruction or corruption of data security breaches other manipulation or improper use of our systems or networks financial losses from remedial actions loss of business or potential liability regulatory enforcement actions andor damage to our reputation any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition we also have a concentration of operations on certain sites eg production and shared services centers where business interruptions could cause material damage and costs transport of goods from suppliers and to customers could also be hampered for the reasons stated above although we continue to assess these risks implement controls and perform business continuity planning we cannot be sure that interruptions with material adverse effects will not occur 

failure to retain our existing senior management engineering sales and other key personnel or the inability to attract and retain new qualified personnel could negatively impact our ability to operate or grow our business 

our success will continue to depend to a significant extent on our ability to retain or attract a significant number of employees in senior management engineering sales and other key personnel the ability to attract or retain employees will depend on our ability to offer competitive compensation training and cultural benefits we will need to continue to develop a roster of qualified talent to support business growth and replace departing employees effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution a failure to retain or attract highly skilled personnel could adversely affect our operating results or ability to operate or grow our business 

if we do not or cannot adequately protect our intellectual property if third parties infringe our intellectual property rights or if third parties claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights we may suffer competitive injury expend significant resources enforcing our rights or defending against such claims or be prevented from selling products or services 

we own numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others which in aggregate are important to our business the intellectual property rights that we obtain however may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage because they may not be sufficiently broad or may be challenged invalidated circumvented independently developed or designedaround particularly in countries where intellectual property rights laws are not highly developed protected or enforced our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we receive notices from third parties alleging intellectual property infringement or misappropriation any dispute or litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation in addition as a result of such claims of infringement or misappropriation we could lose our rights   to critical technology be unable to license critical technology or sell critical products and services be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights or be required to redesign our products at substantial cost any of which could adversely impact our competitive position financial condition and results of operations even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation we may incur significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we cannot make assurances that we will pay dividends on our common stock or continue to repurchase our common stock under board approved share repurchase plans and likewise our indebtedness could limit our ability to pay dividends or make share repurchases 

the timing declaration amount and payment of future dividends to our shareholders fall within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on many factors including our financial condition results of operations and capital requirements as well as applicable law regulatory constraints industry practice and other business considerations that our board of directors considers relevant there can be no assurance that we will pay a dividend in the future or continue to pay dividends 

further the timing and amount of the repurchase of our common stock under board approved share repurchase plans has similar dependencies as the payment of dividends and accordingly there can be no assurances that we will continue to repurchase our common stock 

additionally if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our debt payment obligations then our ability to pay dividends if so determined by the board of directors or make share repurchases will be impaired and we may be required to attempt to restructure or refinance our debt raise additional capital or take other actions such as selling assets reducing or delaying capital expenditures reducing our dividend or delaying or curtailing share repurchases there can be no assurance however that any such actions could be effected on satisfactory terms if at all or would be permitted by the terms of our debt or our other credit and contractual arrangements 

the level of returns on postretirement benefit plan assets changes in interest rates and other factors could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods 

certain members of our current and retired employee population are covered by pension and other employeerelated defined benefit plans collectively postretirement benefit plans we may experience significant fluctuations in costs related to our postretirement benefit plans as a result of macroeconomic factors such as interest rates that are beyond our control the cost of our postretirement plans is incurred over long periods of time and involves factors and uncertainties during those periods which can be volatile and unpredictable including rates of return on postretirement benefit plan assets discount rates used to calculate liabilities and expenses and rates of future compensation increases management develops each assumption using relevant plan and company experience and expectations in conjunction with marketrelated data our liquidity financial position including shareholders’ equity and results of operations could be materially affected by significant changes in key economic indicators actuarial experience financial market volatility future legislation and other governmental regulatory actions 

we make contributions to fund our postretirement benefit plans when considered necessary or advantageous to do so the macroeconomic factors discussed above including the return on postretirement benefit plan assets and the minimum funding requirements established by local government funding or taxing authorities or established by other agreement may influence future funding requirements a significant decline in the fair value of our plan assets or other adverse changes to our overall pension and other employeerelated benefit plans could require us to make significant funding contributions and affect cash flows in future periods 

unforeseen environmental issues could impact our financial position or results of operations 

our operations are subject to and affected by many federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations in addition we could be affected by future environmental laws or regulations including for example those imposed in response to climate change concerns compliance with current and future environmental laws and regulations currently requires and is expected to continue to require operating and capital expenditures 

environmental laws and regulations may authorize substantial fines and criminal sanctions as well as facility shutdowns to address violations and may require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit emissions or discharges we also incur and expect to continue to incur costs to comply with current environmental laws and regulations 

developments such as the adoption of new environmental laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations violations by us of such laws and regulations discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination litigation involving environmental impacts our inability to recover costs associated with any such developments or financial insolvency of other responsible parties could in the future have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 

the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly 

we cannot predict the prices at which our common stock may trade the market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely depending on many factors some of which may be beyond our control including 

 19 

 stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents and indiana law could delay or prevent a change in control 

certain provisions of our third amended and restated articles of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may delay or prevent a merger or acquisition of part or all of our business operations for example the third amended and restated articles of incorporation and the amended and restated bylaws among other things require advance notice for shareholder proposals and nominations and do not permit action by written consent of the shareholders unless unanimous in addition the amended and restated articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock these provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals of our business operations or delay or prevent a change in control which could harm our stock price indiana law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 10 or more of our outstanding common stock and us 

risks related to our 2011 spinoff from itt corporation 

in connection with our spinoff itt and exelis acquired by harris inc on may 29 2015  will indemnify us for certain liabilities and we will indemnify itt or exelis for certain liabilities if we are required to indemnify itt or exelis we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations and our financial results could be negatively impacted in the case of itts or exeliss indemnity there can be no assurance that those indemnities will be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of such liabilities or as to itts or exeliss ability to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future 

pursuant to the distribution agreement and certain other agreements with itt and exelis itt and exelis agreed to indemnify us from certain liabilities and we agreed to indemnify itt and exelis for certain liabilities indemnities that we may be required to provide itt and exelis may be significant and could negatively impact our business particularly indemnities relating to our actions that could impact the taxfree nature of the spinoff third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that itt or exelis has agreed to retain further there can be no assurance that the indemnities from itt and exelis will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities or that itt and exelis will be able to fully satisfy their indemnification obligations moreover even if we ultimately were to succeed in recovering from itt and exelis any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves each of these risks could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition

• adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share defined as net income and earnings per share respectively adjusted to exclude restructuring and realignment costs special charges taxrelated special items and gain from sale of businesses a reconciliation of adjusted net income is provided below 

 • free cash flow defined as net cash from operating activities as reported in the statement of cash flow less capital expenditures as well as adjustments for other significant items that impact current results that management believes are not related to our ongoing operations and performance our definition of free cash flow does not consider certain nondiscretionary cash payments such as debt the following table provides a reconciliation of free cash flow 

executive summary 

xylem reported revenue of 3653 million  for 2015  a decrease of 67  from 3916 million  reported in 2014  revenue increased 13  on a constant currency basis due to strong organic growth in the public utility commercial and residential markets partially offset by declines in industrial in the oil and gas market operating income for 2015  was 449 million  reflecting a decrease of 14 million  or 30  compared to 463 million  in 2014  operating income as a percentage of revenue was 123 for 2015 versus 118 for 2014 an increase of 50 basis points this increase in operating margin was primarily due to reduced restructuring and realignment costs as well as incremental cost savings from continuous improvement initiatives and restructuring actions partially offsetting these actions were cost inflation unfavorable mix and unfavorable foreign exchange translation impacts 

additional financial highlights for 2015  include the following 

 2016  business outlook 

we continue to anticipate organic revenue growth in the lowtomid single digits in 2016 the following is a summary of our outlook by market 

 we will continue to strategically execute restructuring and realignment actions primarily to reposition our european and north american business in an effort to optimize our cost structure and improve our operational efficiency and effectiveness during 2015 we incurred 6 million and 14 million in restructuring and realignment costs respectively as a result of the restructuring actions in 2015 we realized 2 million of net savings and expect to realize approximately 1 million of incremental net savings in 2016 during 2016 we expect to incur approximately 25 million in restructuring and realignment costs we expect to realize approximately 8 million of savings from our 2016 actions 

additional strategic actions we are taking include strategic initiatives to drive abovemarket growth advance continuous improvement activities to increase productivity focus on improving cash performance and drive a disciplined capital deployment strategy

2015  versus 2014   

revenue 

revenue generated for 2015  was 3653 million  a decrease of 263 million  or 67  compared to 3916 million  in 2014  on a constant currency basis revenue grew 13  this increase was primarily driven by strong organic growth within emerging markets particularly in china and india the united states and western europe also grew organically which was partially offset by declines in canada in addition the organic growth was partially offset by the divestiture of the wolverhampton valves business early in the third quarter of 2014 

the following table illustrates the impact on 2015  revenue from organic growth recent acquisitionsdivestitures and foreign currency translation in relation to revenue 

 the following table summarizes revenue by segment for 2015  and 2014  

water infrastructure 

water infrastructure’s revenue decreased 211 million  or 86  in 2015   09  increase on a constant currency basis compared to 2014  the constant currency increase was driven by organic growth of 22 million  or 09  due to continued strength in the public utility end market partially offset by weakness in the industrial market the industrial market performance decline was due to decreases in dewatering applications in the oil and gas market which more than offset increases in the balance of the industrial market 

from an application perspective organic revenue grew in transport treatment and test applications the organic revenue growth from transport applications was predominately due to public utility strength in the emerging markets the united states and in western europe partially offset by declines in industrial dewatering applications from weakness in the oil and gas market in canada and the united states the organic revenue growth from treatment applications was due to ozone and filtration projects in china and australia which was somewhat offset by the lapping of a large project in latin america in 2014 and general weakness in europe organic revenue growth from test applications was driven by growth in china and india due to demand for new wastewater and river monitoring products 

applied water 

applied water’s revenue decreased 52 million  or 35  in 2015  a 18  increase on a constant currency basis compared to 2014 the growth on a constant currency basis is driven primarily by organic revenue growth of 38 million  or 26  due to strength in the commercial industrial water and residential end markets partially offset by declines in the agriculture end market this increase in the current year was partially offset by the absence of 11 million in revenue from the divested wolverhampton valves business 

from an applications perspective the increase in organic revenue was predominately due to continued growth in commercial building services from a recovering institutional building sector in the united states and strength in asia the industrial water application organic revenue grew from project strength in western europe and the united states which was partially offset by the aforementioned wolverhampton divestiture residential building services organic revenue increased primarily in the united states due to improvements in the home construction market and market share gain irrigation applications organic revenue decline was largely impacted by severe flooding conditions in the southeast and southwest regions of the united states and the lapping of a strong fourth quarter in 2014 

ordersbacklog 

orders received during 2015  decreased by 310 million  or 77  to  3711 million  a 02  increase on a constant currency basis organic order growth increased 19 million  or 05  for the year 

water infrastructure segment orders decreased 215 million  or 86  to 2296 million   10  growth on a constant currency basis organic order growth of 10  was predominantly due to organic order increases for treatment applications due to large projects in the middle east and greater asia the organic orders for test applications were slightly up slightly offsetting these increases was a decline in organic orders for transport applications predominately due to decreases in the dewatering transport application due to weakness in the oil and gas market which more than offset solid growth in the remainder of the transport applications 

orders decreased in our applied water segment 95 million  or 63  to 1415 million   10  decline on a constant currency basis the order decline on a constant currency basis was due to the organic order volume decrease of 03  due to market softness in the oil and gas and agricultural markets as well as the absence of orders from our wolverhampton valves divestiture 

delivery schedules vary from customer to customer based upon their requirements typically large projects require longer lead production cycles and delays can occur from time to time total backlog was 716 million  at december 31 2015  and 740 million  at december 31 2014  this decrease is due to foreign currency translation impacts we anticipate that approximately 81  of the backlog at december 31 2015  will be recognized as revenue during 2016  

gross margin 

gross margins as a percentage of consolidated revenue declined to 384  in 2015  from 386  in 2014  the gross margin decline was primarily due to negative currency translation impacts excluding the negative currency translation impacts gross margin was slightly higher as compared to 2014 benefits realized from cost saving initiatives through global sourcing and lean six sigma as well as increased volume more than offset material and labor inflation headwinds and unfavorable sales mix primarily due to higher volume sold to the emerging markets 

operating expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses 

sga decreased by 66 million  or 72  to 234  of revenue in 2015  as compared to 235  of revenue in 2014  the decrease in sga expenses as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to currency translation impacts additionally cost inflation was offset by cost savings from continuous improvement initiatives and restructuring actions as well as reduced realignment costs 

research and development expenses 

rd spending decreased 9 million  or 87  to 26  of revenue in 2015  as compared to 27  of revenue in 2014  primarily due to currency translation impacts 

restructuring charges 

during 2015  we incurred restructuring costs of 5 million  and 1 million  in our water infrastructure and applied water segments respectively these charges were incurred primarily in an effort to realign our organizational structure in europe and north america to optimize our cost structure the charges relate to the reduction in structural costs including a decrease in headcount and consolidation of facilities during 2014  we recognized restructuring costs of 19 million 6 million and 1 million in our water infrastructure and applied water segments and corporate and other respectively these charges were incurred primarily in an effort to realign our organizational structure in europe and north america to optimize our cost structure the charges relate to the reduction in structural costs including a decrease in headcount and consolidation of facilities 

total expected costs associated with actions that commenced during 2015 are approximately 5 million for water infrastructure and approximately 1 million for applied water these costs primarily comprise severance charges the water infrastructure actions are expected to continue through the second quarter of 2016 substantially all of cost associated with the applied water actions have been incurred as a result of these actions initiated in 2015 we achieved savings of approximately 2 million in 2015 and estimate annual future net savings beginning in 2016 of approximately 3 million resulting in 1 million of incremental savings in 2016 from the 2015 actions 

operating income 

we generated operating income of 449 million  during 2015  a 14 million  or 30  decrease from the prior year operating income as a percentage of revenue was 123 for 2015 versus 118 for 2014 an increase of 50 basis points this increase in operating margin was primarily due to reduced restructuring and realignment costs incremental cost savings from continuous improvement initiatives and slightly higher volume partially offsetting these actions were cost inflation unfavorable mix and unfavorable foreign exchange translation impacts 

the following table illustrates operating income results for our business segments 

the table below provides a reconciliation of the total and each segments operating income to adjusted operating income and a calculation of the corresponding adjusted operating margin 

nm not meaningful 

water infrastructure 

operating income for our water infrastructure segment decreased 18 million  or 56  decreased 33 million  or 94  on an adjusted basis compared to the prior year on an adjusted basis the operating margin decreased from 143 to 142 the reduction in operating margin was due to cost inflation and unfavorable mix resulting from the declines in our dewatering business driven by oil and gas weakness and lower emerging market margins this reduction was not quite offset by cost savings from procurement initiatives lean six sigma initiatives and restructuring actions 

applied water 

operating income for our applied water segment decreased 3 million  or 16  decreased 9 million  or 44  on an adjusted basis compared to the prior year on an adjusted basis the operating margin decreased from 140 to 139 the reduction in operating margin was due to cost inflation unfavorable mix and foreign exchange impacts partially offset by cost reductions from procurement and lean six sigma initiatives and higher volume 

corporate and other 

operating loss for corporate and other decreased 7 million  or 137  decreased 6 million  or 120  on an adjusted basis compared to the prior year the reduction in adjusted operating loss was primarily due to reduced information technology and franchise tax costs 

interest expense 

interest expense was 55 million  and 54 million  for 2015  and 2014  respectively primarily related to interest expense on 12 billion aggregate principal amount of our senior notes refer to note 13  “credit facilities and longterm debt” for further details 

income tax expense 

the income tax provision for 2015  was 63 million  at an effective tax rate of 156  compared to 84 million  at an effective tax rate of 198  in 2014  the 2015  effective tax rate is lower than 2014  due primarily to geographic mix of earnings as well as a reduction in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits recorded 

other comprehensive loss income 

other comprehensive loss before tax of 130 million  in 2015  as compared to 284 million  loss in 2014  was primarily due to a 23 million  net gain in postretirement benefit plans foreign currency in 2015 as compared to a net loss of 110 million  for 2014 further contributing to this decreased loss was a lower translation loss of 26 million  primarily due to less weakening of the euro against the us dollar largely offset by the additional weakening of the swedish krona against the us dollar additionally there was a release of 8 million of currency translation gains out of other comprehensive loss income recognized as part of the sale of a business 

2014  versus 2013 

revenue 

revenue generated for 2014 was 3916 million an increase of 79 million or 21 compared to 3837 million in 2013 on a constant currency basis revenue grew 33 the following table illustrates the impact on 2014 revenue from organic growth recent acquisitions and fluctuations in foreign currency 

 the following table summarizes revenue by segment for 2014 and 2013 

water infrastructure 

water infrastructure’s revenue increased 58 million or 24 in 2014 44 on a constant currency basis the 44 constant currency increase reflects growth within the industrial water and public utility end markets and 6 million of incremental revenue from our 2013 acquisitions 

organic revenue increased 99 million or 42 during the year which was substantially due to higher volumes in transport test and treatment applications revenue from transport applications grew primarily from increased industrial dewatering applications in the united states from oil and gas marketrelated rental activities transport 

also grew organically from public utility pump and aftermarket demand revenue from test applications increased due to significant strength in the united states from increased government spending coupled with the continued success of new products and crossselling of our european technologies revenue from treatment applications grew from the delivery of several large projects in the emerging markets particularly in latin america partially offset by lower deliverable project backlog in the united states and european markets 

applied water 

applied water’s revenue increased 21 million or 14 in 2014 a 16 increase on a constant currency basis the growth on a constant currency basis is driven primarily by organic revenue growth of 35 million or 24 versus the prior year due to strength in the commercial building services industrial water and agriculture end markets which more than offset declines in the residential building services the increase in the current year was partially offset by the absence of revenue from our wolverhampton valves business following its divestiture in the third quarter of 2014 as compared to 12 million of revenue for the comparative period in 2013 

organic revenue increased 35 million or 24 for the year due primarily to commercial building recovery in the united states institutional building market including distributor restocking and promotional activity also contributing to the organic growth was industrial water application strength across all regions particularly from projects in the middle east and latin america irrigation application revenue also grew driven by the timing of project shipments and increased demand for vertical turbines a decline in european demand for residential applications partially offset organic growth 

ordersbacklog 

orders received during 2014 increased by 109 million or 28 to 4021 million a 39 increase on a constant currency basis organic order growth increased 153 million or 39 for the year 

water infrastructure segment orders increased 68 million or 28 to 2511 million 44 growth on a constant currency basis including 8 million from acquisitions organic order growth of 41 was primarily due to higher industrial demand within transport for wastewater pumps in the united states and europe as well as strength within the dewatering business for rental and equipment sales into oil and gas markets orders for test applications also bolstered the growth for the segment from large orders in the united states the strength in transport and test offset declines in treatment from project delays in the united states and europe 

orders increased in our applied water segment 41 million or 28 to 1510 million 30 growth on a constant currency basis organic growth of 36 was driven by strong performance in the commercial building services and industrial water markets in the united states as well as continued strength in china the growth was partially offset by weakness in the residential markets of europe 

delivery schedules vary from customer to customer based upon their requirements typically large projects require longer lead production cycles and delays can occur from time to time total backlog was 740 million at december 31 2014 and 707 million at december 31 2013 we anticipate that more than 85 of the backlog at december 31 2014 will be recognized as revenue during 2015 

gross margin 

gross margins as a percentage of consolidated revenue declined to 386 in 2014 from 391 in 2013 the decrease is primarily attributable to lower margin sales within the water infrastructure segment caused by higher mix sold to emerging markets which have lower margins in conjunction with foreign exchange headwinds as well as unfavorable product sales mix these negative impacts were partially mitigated by benefits from restructuring savings and costsaving initiatives through lean six sigma and global sourcing across both segments 

operating expenses 



nm not meaningful percentage change 

selling general and administrative expenses 

sga decreased by 66 million or 67 to 920 million or 235 of revenue in 2014 as compared to 986 million or 257 of revenue in 2013 the decrease in sga expenses as a percentage of revenue is due primarily to savings from restructuring actions combined with lapping the impacts from nonrecurring special charges in 2013 of 24 million which comprise the legal settlement with xylem group llc costs incurred for the change in our chief executive officer costs incurred for the contractual indemnification of federal tax obligations to itt and costs associated with a legal judgment arising from a historical acquisition matter the decrease was also driven by 7 million less realignment costs in 2014 which were costs incurred by the company to reposition our european business in an effort to optimize our cost structure and improve our operational efficiency and effectiveness as well as implement our new organizational structure 

research and development expenses 

rd spending was flat at 104 million or 27 of revenue in both 2014 and 2013 

restructuring and asset impairment charges 

during 2014 we incurred restructuring costs of 19 million 6 million and 1 million in our water infrastructure and applied water segments and corporate and other respectively these charges were incurred primarily in an effort to realign our organizational structure in europe and north america to optimize our cost structure the charges relate to the reduction in structural costs including a decrease in headcount and consolidation of facilities during 2013 we recognized restructuring costs of 31 million and 9 million in our water infrastructure and applied water segments respectively these charges were incurred primarily in an effort to realign our organizational structure in europe and north america to address declines in sales volumes and optimize our cost structure the charges relate to the reduction in structural costs including a decrease in headcount and consolidation of facilities 

total expected costs associated with actions that commenced during 2014 are approximately 19 million for water infrastructure approximately 6 million for applied water and approximately 1 million for corporate and other these costs primarily comprise severance charges and the actions are substantially complete as a result of these actions initiated in 2014 we achieved savings of approximately 13 million in 2014 and annual future net savings beginning in 2015 of approximately 26 million 

total costs associated with actions that commenced during 2013 are approximately 32 million for water infrastructure and approximately 8 million for applied water these costs primarily comprise severance charges these actions are substantially complete as a result of actions initiated during 2013 we achieved net savings of approximately 13 million in 2013 and annual future net savings beginning in 2014 of approximately 36 million 

additionally in the fourth quarter of 2013 we recorded a 2 million impairment charge related to three trade names in our water infrastructure segment associated with acquired businesses within our analytics operating unit reflecting a decline in their value since being acquired refer to note 4 “restructuring and asset impairment charges” for additional information 

operating income 

we generated operating income of 463 million during 2014 a 100 million or 275 increase from the prior year operating income of 363 million primarily reflecting costsaving initiatives and savings from restructuring actions these benefits were partially offset by cost inflation combined with unfavorable impacts from our geographic and product sales mix described above another driving factor in the yearoveryear improvement was the absence of the aforementioned special charges in 2013 within sga which did not recur as well as lower restructuring and realignment costs the following table illustrates operating income results by business segments for 2014 and 2013

operating income for our water infrastructure segment increased 58 million or 221 increased 35 million or 111 on an adjusted basis compared with the prior year the 111 increase was primarily driven by higher volume restructuring savings and cost reduction initiatives such as global sourcing and lean six sigma the increase was partially offset by cost inflation unfavorable sales mix and price 

applied water 

operating income for our applied water segment increased 18 million or 103 increased 15 million or 79 on an adjusted basis compared to the prior year the 79 increase was driven by lean six sigma initiatives global sourcing and restructuring savings combined with modest price realization the increase was partially offset by cost inflation and unfavorable foreign exchange headwinds 

corporate and other 

operating loss for corporate and other decreased 24 million or 320 decreased 5 million or 91 on an adjusted basis compared to the prior year the reduction in adjusted operating loss was primarily due to reduced stock based compensation expense and costs associated with the corporate headquarter move in 2013 that did not recur in 2014 

interest expense 

interest expense was 54 million and 55 million for 2014 and 2013 respectively primarily related to interest expense on 12 billion aggregate principal amount of our senior notes refer to note 13  “credit facilities and longterm debt” for further details 

income tax expense 

the income tax provision for 2014 was 84 million at an effective tax rate of 198 compared to 70 million at an effective tax rate of 235 in 2013 the 2014 effective tax rate is lower than 2013 due primarily to geographic mix of earnings 

other comprehensive loss income 

other comprehensive loss before tax of 284 million in 2014 as compared to income of 74 million in 2013 was primarily due to a 221 million foreign currency translation impact due to a weakening of the euro british pound and swedish krona against the us dollar further contributing to the yearoveryear decline was a 110 million net loss in postretirement benefit plans in 2014 as compared to a net gain of 34 million in 2013 due to a decrease in discount rates partially mitigated by actual gains on plan assets in excess of the assumed longterm rate of return the effective tax rate on other comprehensive income decreased as compared to 2013 due primarily to the shift in comprehensive earnings from foreign currency translation which is not taxable as well as from a change in the jurisdictional mix of net gains and losses from postretirement benefit plans 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash 

 sources and uses of liquidity 

operating activities 

during 2015  net cash provided by operating activities was 464 million  compared to 416 million  in 2014  the 48 million  yearoveryear increase was primarily driven by a decrease in the use of working capital from reduced inventory levels in 2015 and improved collections of receivables lower payments for restructuring and 

postretirement benefit plans were more than offset by increased payments for foreign valueadded taxes as compared to the prior year 

during 2014  net cash provided by operating activities was 416 million  compared to 324 million  in 2013  the 92 million  yearoveryear increase was driven by an increase in income as well as a modest improvement in working capital performance reductions in payments made for restructuring and postretirement plan contributions in 2014 were largely offset by an increase in tax payments also contributing to the increase was a refund of valueadded tax in the current year that had been paid during 2013 

investing activities 

cash used in investing activities was 132 million  for 2015  compared to 86 million  in 2014  the increase of 46 million  was primarily due to 18 million  spent on an acquisition in 2015 as compared to nothing in 2014 as well as cash received in 2014 of 30 million for the sale of our wolverhampton business 

cash used in investing activities was 86 million  in 2014  compared to 199 million  in 2013  the decrease of 113 million  was primarily driven by a decrease in acquisition activity as there were no acquisitions in 2014 whereas we spent 81 million for acquisitions during 2013 also contributing to the decrease was the receipt of 30 million in 2014 for the sale of a business capital expenditures were also lower in 2014 with a 7 million reduction primarily due to a decrease in the spending on post spinoff information technology investments and the relocation of our corporate headquarters 

financing activities 

cash used by financing activities was 262 million  147 million  and 100 million  during 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively in 2015 the 115 million increase is primarily driven by an increase in share repurchase activity of 45 million  and an increase of 8 million  or a 10 per share increase in dividends paid to shareholders as well as a decrease in cash received from shortterm debt borrowings under the european investment bank facility of 50 million in 2014 the 47 million increase reflected cash used for share repurchase activity increasing 61 million and dividend payments increasing 7 million compared to 2013 these uses were partially offset by an increase in cash received from shortterm debt borrowings under the european investment bank facility of 50 million in 2014 versus 38 million in 2013 

funding and liquidity strategy 

our ability to fund our capital needs depends on our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access to bank financing and the capital markets historically we have generated operating cash flow sufficient to fund our primary cash needs centered on operating activities working capital capital expenditures and strategic investments if our cash flows from operations are less than we expect we may need to incur debt or issue equity from time to time we may need to access the longterm and shortterm capital markets to obtain financing our access to and the availability of financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors including i our credit ratings or absence of a credit rating ii the liquidity of the overall capital markets and iii the current state of the economy there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or that such financing will be available at all 

our global funding requirements are continually monitored with appropriate strategies executed to ensure liquidity needs are met cost effectively based on our current global cash positions cash flows from operations and access to the commercial paper markets we believe there is sufficient liquidity to meet our funding requirements in addition our existing committed credit facilities and access to the public debt markets would provide further liquidity if required 

we anticipate that our present sources of funds including funds from operations and additional borrowings will provide us with sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet our liquidity and capital needs in both the united states and outside of the united states over the next twelve months 

senior notes 

on september 20 2011 we issued 3550 senior notes of 600 million aggregate principal amount due september 2016 the senior notes due 2016 and 4875 senior notes of 600 million aggregate principal amount due october 2021 the senior notes due 2021 and together with the senior notes due 2016 the senior notes 

the senior notes include covenants which restrict our ability subject to exceptions to incur debt secured by liens and engage in sale and leaseback transactions as well as provide for customary events of default subject in certain cases to receipt of notice of default andor customary grace and cure periods we may redeem the senior 

notes as applicable in whole or in part at any time at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the senior notes to be redeemed plus a makewhole premium if a change of control triggering event as defined in the senior notes occurs we will be required to make an offer to purchase the senior notes at a price equal to 101 of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase as of december 31 2015  we were in compliance with all covenants 

interest on the senior notes due 2016 is payable on march 20 and september 20 of each year interest on the senior notes due 2021 is payable on april 1 and october 1 of each year 

as of december 31 2015 we have classified 600 million of our senior notes due 2016 as longterm based on our current ability and intent to refinance the outstanding borrowings on a longterm basis 

credit facility

at our election the interest rate per annum applicable to the revolving loans will be based on either i a eurodollar rate determined by reference to libor adjusted for statutory reserve requirements plus an applicable margin or ii a fluctuating rate of interest determined by reference to the greatest of a the prime rate of citibank na b the us federal funds effective rate plus 05 or c the eurodollar rate determined by reference to libor adjusted for statutory reserve requirements in each case plus an applicable margin 

in accordance with the terms we may not exceed a maximum leverage ratio of 350 to 100 based on a ratio of total debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization throughout the term the credit facility also contains limitations on among other things incurring secured debt granting liens entering into sale and leaseback transactions mergers consolidations liquidations dissolutions and sales of assets in addition the credit facility contains other terms and conditions such as customary representations and warranties additional covenants and customary events of default as of december 31 2015  we were in compliance with all covenants 

as of december 31 2015  the credit facility was undrawn 

research and development facility agreement 

on december 3 2015 the company amended and restated its risk sharing finance facility agreement the rd facility agreement with the european investment bank the eib to amend the maturity date the facility provides an aggregate principal amount of up to €120 million approximately 132 million to finance research projects and infrastructure development in the european union the companys wholly owned subsidiaries in luxembourg xylem holdings sá rl and xylem international sá rl are the borrowers under the rd facility agreement the obligations of the borrowers under the rd facility agreement are guaranteed by the company under an amended and restated deed of guarantee dated as of december 4 2013 in favor of the eib the funds are available during the period from 2013 through 2016 at the companys facilities in sweden germany italy the united kingdom austria norway and hungary   

under the rd facility agreement the borrower can draw loans on or before march 31 2016 with a ma turity of no longer than 12 years the rd facility agreement provides for fixed rate loans and floating rate loans the interest rate per annum applicable to fixed rate loans is at a fixed percentage rate per annum specified by the eib which includes the applicable margin the interest rate per annum applicable to floating rate loans is at the rate determined by reference to euribor for loans drawn in euros and libor for loans drawn in pounds sterling or us dollars plus an applicable spread specified by the eib which includes the applicable margin the applicable margin for both fixed rate loans and floating rate loans is determined by reference to the credit rating of the company   

in accordance with the terms of the rd facility agreement we may not exceed a maximum leverage ratio of 350 to 100 based on a ratio of total debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization throughout the term the rd facility agreement also contains limitations on among other things incurring debt granting liens and entering into sale and leaseback transactions in addition the rd facility agreement contains other terms and conditions such as customary representations and warranties additional covenants and customary events of default as of december 31 2015 we were in compliance with all covenants   

as of december 31 2015  and 2014  76 million  and 84 million   was outstanding respectively under the rd facility agreement although the borrowing term for this arrangement is up to five years we have classified it as shortterm debt on our consolidated balance sheet since we intend to repay this obligation in less than a year   

nonus operations 

for 2015  and 2014  we generated 59  and 62 of our revenue from nonus operations respectively as we continue to grow our operations in the emerging markets and elsewhere outside of the united states we expect to continue to generate significant revenue from nonus operations and we expect our cash will be predominately held by our foreign subsidiaries we expect to manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed we may transfer cash from certain international subsidiaries to the us and other international subsidiaries when we believe it is cost effective to do so we continually review our domestic and foreign cash profile expected future cash generation and investment opportunities which support our current designation of a portion of these funds as being indefinitely reinvested and reassess whether there is a demonstrated need to repatriate funds held internationally to support our us operations if as a result of our review it is determined that all or a portion of the funds may be needed for our operations in the united states we may be required to accrue additional us taxes as of december 31 2015  our foreign subsidiaries were holding 656 million  in cash or marketable securities 

as of december 31 2015  our excess of financial reporting over the tax basis of investments in certain foreign subsidiaries totaled 19 billion  we have not asserted that 41 million  of our excess basis difference will be indefinitely reinvested and have therefore provided for us or additional foreign withholding taxes for that portion generally such amounts become subject to us taxation upon the remittance of dividends and under certain other circumstances 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual commitments as of december 31 2015  

in addition to the amounts presented in the table above we have recorded liabilities for uncertain tax positions of 47 million  net investment hedges of 18 million  and employee severance indemnity of 13 million  these amounts have been excluded from the contractual obligations table due to an inability to reasonably estimate the timing or amounts of such payments in individual years further benefit payments which reflect expected future service related to the companys pension and other postretirement employee benefit obligations are presented in note 14  “postretirement benefit plans” of the consolidated financial statements and not included in the above table finally estimated environmental payments and workers compensation and general liability reserves are excluded from the table above we estimate based on historical experience that we will spend approximately 1 million to 2 million per year on environmental investigation and remediation and approximately 4 million to 5 million per year on workers compensation and general liability at december 31 2015  we had estimated and accrued 4 million  and 24 million  related to environmental matters and workers compensation and general liability respectively 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2015  we have issued guarantees for the debt and other obligations of consolidated subsidiaries in the normal course of business we have determined that none of these arrangements has a material current effect or is reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our consolidated financial statements financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

we obtain certain standby letters of credit bank guarantees and surety bonds from thirdparty financial institutions in the ordinary course of business when required under contracts or to satisfy insurance related requirements as of december 31 2015  the amount of standby letters of credit bank guarantees and surety bonds was 161 million  

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 

significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are discussed in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” of the consolidated financial statements accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they are inherently uncertain involve significant judgments include areas where different estimates reasonably could have been used and changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable however actual results in these areas could differ from management’s estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

revenue recognition  we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured for product sales delivery does not occur until the products have been shipped risk of loss has been transferred to the customer and the contractual terms have been fulfilled in instances where contractual terms include a provision for customer acceptance revenue is recognized when either i we have previously demonstrated that the product meets the specified criteria based on either seller or customerspecified objective criteria or ii upon formal acceptance received from the customer where the product has not been previously demonstrated to meet customerspecified objective criteria revenue on service and repair contracts is recognized after services have been agreed to by the customer and rendered 

we enter into contracts to sell our products and services and while the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions certain agreements contain multiple elements or nonstandard terms and conditions where sales agreements contain multiple elements or nonstandard terms and conditions judgment is required to determine the appropriate accounting including whether the deliverables specified in these agreements should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes and if so how the transaction price should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize revenue for each element when a sale involves multiple deliverables the total revenue from the arrangement is allocated to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price of the deliverable to all other deliverables in the contract revenue for multiple element arrangements is recognized when the appropriate revenue recognition criteria for the individual deliverable have been satisfied the allocation of sales price between elements may impact the timing of revenue recognition but will not change the total revenue recognized on the arrangement for delivered elements accounted for as separate units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement revenue is recognized only when the delivered elements have standalone value there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance and there are no customernegotiated refund or return rights affecting the sales recognized 

certain businesses enter into longterm constructiontype sales contracts for which revenue is recognized under the percentageofcompletion method based upon percentage of costs incurred to total estimated costs 

we record a reduction in revenue at the time of sale for estimated product returns rebates and other allowances based on historical experience and known trends 

income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities applying enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which 

we expect the differences will reverse based on the evaluation of available evidence we recognize future tax benefits such as net operating loss carryforwards to the extent that we believe it is more likely than not we will realize these benefits we periodically assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets and reflect any changes to our estimate of the amount we are more likely than not to realize in the valuation allowance with a corresponding adjustment to earnings or other comprehensive income as appropriate 

in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we look to the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences taxable income in carryback years and the feasibility of tax planning strategies and estimated future taxable income the valuation allowance can be affected by changes to tax laws changes to statutory tax rates and changes to future taxable income estimates 

our effective tax rate reflects the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which we have not provided us taxes because we plan to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside the united states we plan foreign earnings remittance amounts based on projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and longterm investment requirements of our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic operations based on these assumptions we estimate the amount we will distribute to the united states and provide the us federal taxes due on these amounts material changes in our estimates of cash working capital and longterm investment requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we do business could impact our effective tax rate 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and to the extent to which additional taxes will be due furthermore we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

we adjust our liability for uncertain tax positions in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional tax expense would result if a payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 

goodwill and intangible assets  we review goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable we also review the carrying value of our finitelived intangible assets for potential impairment when impairment indicators arise we conduct our annual impairment test as of the first day of the fourth quarter we perform a twostep impairment test for goodwill in the first step we compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds its fair value then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to measure the impairment loss to be recorded if any if the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value then we record an impairment loss equal to the difference in our annual impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets we compare the fair value of those assets to their carrying value we recognize an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying value we estimate the fair value of our reporting units and intangible assets with indefinite lives using an income approach under the income approach we calculate fair value based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinitelived intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions particularly related to future operating results and cash flows these estimates and assumptions include but are not limited to revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates assumed royalty rates future economic and market conditions and identification of appropriate market comparable data in addition the identification of reporting units and the allocation of assets and liabilities to the reporting units when determining the carrying value of each reporting unit also require judgment goodwill is tested for impairment at either the operating segment identified in note 20  “segment and geographic data” of the consolidated financial statements or one level below the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets is based on estimates and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable significant changes to these estimates and assumptions could adversely impact our conclusions actual future results may differ from those estimates 

during the fourth quarter of 2015  we performed our annual impairment assessment and determined that the estimated fair values of our goodwill reporting units were substantially in excess of each of their carrying values however future goodwill impairment tests could result in a charge to earnings we will continue to evaluate goodwill on an annual basis as of the beginning of our fourth quarter and whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate there may be a potential impairment we determined that no impairment of the indefinitelived intangibles existed as of the measurement date in 2015 

contingent liabilities as discussed in note 18  commitments and contingencies of the consolidated financial statements the company is from time to time subject to a variety of litigation environmental liabilities product liabilities and similar contingent liabilities incidental to its business or the business operations of previously owned entities the company recognizes a liability for any contingency that is known or probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable these assessments require judgments concerning matters such as litigation developments and outcomes the anticipated outcome of negotiations the number of future claims and the cost of both pending and future claims in addition because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time liabilities may change in the future due to various factors including those discussed in note 18  of the consolidated financial statements if the liabilities established by the company with respect to these contingencies are inadequate the company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the recorded liability which would adversely affect the company’s financial statements 

receivables and allowance for doubtful accounts and discounts receivables primarily comprise uncollected amounts owed to us from transactions with customers and are presented net of allowances for doubtful accounts and early payment discounts 

we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts using a combination of factors to reduce our trade receivable balances to their estimated net realizable amount we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a variety of factors including the length of time receivables are past due macroeconomic trends and conditions significant onetime events historical experience and the financial condition of customers in addition we record a specific reserve for individual accounts when we become aware of specific customer circumstances such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer’s operating results or financial position the past due or delinquency status of a receivable is based on the contractual payment terms of the receivable if circumstances related to the specific customer change we adjust estimates of the recoverability of receivables as appropriate we determine our allowance for early payment discounts primarily based on historical experience with customers 

credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is generally diversified due to the large number of entities comprising our customer base and their dispersion across many different geographical regions we perform ongoing credit evaluations of the financial condition of our thirdparty distributors resellers and other customers and require collateral such as letters of credit and bank guarantees in certain circumstances as of december 31 2015  and 2014  we do not believe we have any significant concentrations of credit risk 

postretirement plans company employees around the world participate in numerous defined benefit plans the determination of projected benefit obligations and the recognition of expenses related to these plans are dependent on various assumptions these major assumptions primarily relate to discount rates expected longterm rates of return on plan assets rate of future compensation increases mortality health care inflation and years of service some of which are disclosed in note 14  “postretirement benefit plans” of the consolidated financial statements and other factors actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized on a straightline basis only to the extent they exceed 10 of the higher of the marketrelated value or projected benefit obligation over the average remaining service period of active plan participants or for plans with all or substantially all inactive participants over the average remaining life expectancy 

significant assumptions 

management develops each assumption using relevant company experience in conjunction with marketrelated data for each individual country in which such plans exist all assumptions are reviewed annually with thirdparty consultants and adjusted as necessary the table included below provides the weighted average assumptions used to estimate our defined benefit pension obligations and costs as of and for the years ended 2015  and 2014  



 we determine the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets by evaluating both historical returns and estimates of future returns specifically the company analyzes the estimated future returns based on independent estimates of asset class returns and evaluates historical broad market returns over longterm timeframes based on the strategic asset allocation which is detailed in note 14  “postretirement benefit plans” of the consolidated financial statements 

based on the approach described above the chart below shows weighted average actual returns versus the weighted average expected longterm rates of return for our pension plans that were utilized in the calculation of the net periodic pension cost for each respective year 

for the recognition of net periodic pension cost the calculation of the expected return on plan assets is generally derived by applying the expected longterm rate of return to the marketrelated value of plan assets the marketrelated value of plan assets is based on average asset values at the measurement date over the last five years the use of fair value rather than a calculated value could materially affect net periodic pension cost the weighted average expected longterm rate of return for all of our plan assets to be used in determining net periodic benefit costs for 2016  is estimated at 732  we estimate that every 25 basis point change in the expected return on plan assets impacts the expense by 1 million 

the discount rate reflects our expectation of the present value of expected future cash payments for benefits at the measurement date a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense we base the discount rate assumption on current investment yields of highquality fixed income investments during the retirement benefits maturity period the pension discount rate was determined by considering an interest rate yield curve comprising aaaaa bonds with maturities between zero and 30 years developed by the plan’s actuaries annual benefit payments are then discounted to present value using this yield curve to develop a singlepoint discount rate matching the plan’s characteristics our weighted average discount rate for all pension plans effective january 1 2016  is 353  we estimate that every 25 basis point change in the discount rate impacts the expense by 1 million 

the rate of future compensation increase assumption reflects our longterm actual experience and future and nearterm outlook effective january 1 2016  our expected rate of future compensation is 329 for all pension plans the estimated impact of a 25 basis point change in the expected rate of future compensation is less than 1 million 

the assumed rate of future increases in the per capita cost of health care the health care trend rate is 700  for 2016  decreasing ratably to 450 in 2027 an increase or decrease in the health care trend rates by one percent per year would impact the aggregate annual service and interest components by less than 1 million and impact the benefit obligation by approximately 4 million 

we currently anticipate making contributions to our pension and postretirement benefit plans in the range of 26 million  to 36 million  during 2016  of which 8 million  is expected to be made in the first quarter 

funded status 

funded status is derived by subtracting the respective yearend values of the projected benefit obligations from the fair value of plan assets we estimate that every 25 basis point change in the discount rate impacts the funded status by approximately 26 million 

fair value of plan assets 

the plan assets of our pension plans comprise a broad range of investments including domestic and foreign equity securities interests in private equity and hedge funds fixed income investments insurance contracts and cash and cash equivalents 

a portion of our pension benefit plan assets portfolio comprises investments in private equity and hedge funds the private equity and hedge fund investments are generally measured at net asset value however in certain instances the values reported by the asset managers were not current at the measurement date accordingly we made estimate adjustments to the last reported value where necessary to measure the assets at fair value at the measurement date these adjustments consider information received from the asset managers as well as general market information the adjustment recorded at december 31 2015  and 2014  for these assets represented less than one percent of total plan assets in each respective year asset values for other positions were generally measured using market observable prices we estimate that a 5 change in asset values will impact funded status by approximately 25 million

 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates these exposures are actively monitored by management our exposure to foreign exchange rate risk is due to certain costs revenue and borrowings being denominated in currencies other than one of our subsidiaries functional currency similarly we are exposed to market risk as the result of changes in interest rates which may affect the cost of our financing it is our policy and practice to use derivative financial instruments only to the extent necessary to manage exposures 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we conduct approximately 59  of our business in various locations outside the united states 

our economic foreign currency risk primarily relates to receipts from customers payments to suppliers and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies we may use derivative financial instruments to offset risk related to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers when it is believed that the exposure will not be limited by our normal operating and financing activities we enter into currency forward contracts periodically in order to manage the exchange rate fluctuation risk on certain intercompany transactions associated with third party sales and purchases these risks are also mitigated by natural hedges including the presence of manufacturing facilities outside the united states global sourcing and other spending which occurs in foreign countries our principal foreign currency transaction exposures primarily relate to the euro swedish krona canadian dollar british pound polish zloty and australian dollar we estimate that a hypothetical 10 movement in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material economic impact to xylem’s financial position and results of operations 

additionally we are subject to foreign exchange translation risk due to changes in the value of foreign currencies in relation to our reporting currency the us dollar the translation risk is primarily concentrated in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro british pound chinese yuan swedish krona canadian dollar and australian dollar as the us dollar strengthens against other currencies in which we transact business revenue and income will generally be negatively impacted and if the us dollar weakens revenue and income will generally be positively impacted we estimate that a hypothetical 10 movement of the us dollar to the various foreign currency exchange rates we translate from in the aggregate could have approximately a 7 impact on xylems consolidated revenue and income as reported in us dollars we expect to continue to generate significant revenue from nonus operations and we expect our cash will be predominately held by our foreign subsidiaries we expect to manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed we may transfer cash from certain international subsidiaries to the us and other international subsidiaries when it is cost effective to do so though our intent is to indefinitely reinvest most of these funds outside of the us as such we do not expect translation risk to have a material economic impact on our financial position and results of operations 

interest rate risk 

as of december 31 2015  our debt portfolio is primarily comprised of two fixedrate senior notes that total 12 billion the 600 million senior note due 2021 is not exposed to interest rate risk as the bond is at a fixedrate until maturity the other 600 million senior note will mature on september 20th 2016 and the company intends to refinance the debt with new debt instruments until the company closes the refinancing of the notes due we are exposed to interest rate risk that can potentially impact the planned issuance of debt instruments based on current interest rate market we do not anticipate material risk associated with our debt refinancing within the target timeframe of completion 

commodity price exposures 

portions of our business are exposed to volatility in the prices of certain commodities such as copper nickel and aluminum among others our primary exposure to this volatility resides with the use of these materials in purchased component parts we generally maintain longterm fixed price contracts on raw materials and component parts however we are prone to exposure as these contracts expire we estimate that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in prices for raw metal commodities would not be material to our financial position and results of operations

 item 1 business 

business overview 

xylem with 2014  revenue of 39 billion  and approximately 12500  employees is a world leader in the design manufacturing and application of highly engineered technologies for the water industry we are a leading equipment and service provider for water and wastewater applications with a broad portfolio of products and services addressing the full cycle of water from collection distribution and use to the return of water to the environment we have leading market positions among equipment and service providers in the core application areas of the water equipment industry transport treatment test building services industrial processing and irrigation our company’s brands such as bell  gossett and flygt are well known throughout the industry and have served the water market for many years 

we serve a global customer base across diverse end markets while offering localized expertise we sell our products in more than 150 countries through a balanced distribution network consisting of our direct sales force and independent channel partners in 2014  62  of our revenue was generated outside the united states with 21  of revenue generated in emerging markets 

in 2014 we began implementing an organizational redesign to integrate our commercial teams within geographical regions the integration of our commercial teams creates a crossxylem sales and marketing organization shifting from a dedicated product line organizational structure this sales structure is largely in place in the company’s europe middle east africa and asia regions and to a lesser extent in our other regions while this organizational redesign did not change the company’s reportable segments it had implications on how the company manages the business the most significant of which was the shift of certain responsibilities namely customer and marketrelated activities into the regional selling organizations 

our industry 

our planet faces a serious water challenge less than 1 of the total water available on earth is fresh water and this percentage is declining due to factors such as the draining of aquifers increased pollution and climate change in addition demand for fresh water is rising rapidly due to population growth industrial expansion and increased agricultural development with consumption estimated to double every 20 years by 2025 more than 30 of the world’s population is expected to live in areas without adequate water supply even in developed countries with sufficient clean water supply existing infrastructure for water supply is aging and inadequately funded in the united states degrading pipe systems leak one out of every six gallons of water on average on its way from a treatment plant to the customer these challenges are driving opportunities for growth in the global water industry which we estimate to have a total market size of approximately 550 billion  

we view these challenges through the lens of water productivity water quality and resilience water productivity refers to the more efficient delivery and use of clean water water quality refers to the efficient and effective management of wastewater resilience refers to the management of waterrelated risks and the resilience of water infrastructure the company’s customers often face all three of these challenges ranging from inefficient aging water distribution networks which require increases in “water productivity” energyintensive or unreliable wastewater management systems which require increases in “water quality” or exposure to natural disasters such as floods or droughts which require increases in “resilience” delivering value in these areas creates significant opportunity for the company 

the water industry supply chain is comprised of equipment and services companies design and build service providers and utilities equipment and service providers serve distinct customer types the utilities supply water through an infrastructure network supply chain companies provide single or sometimes combined functions from equipment manufacturing and services to facility design engineering procurement and construction or “epc” firms to plant operations utilities as depicted below in figure 1 the utilities and epc customers are looking for technology and application expertise from their equipment and services providers to address trends such as rising pollution stricter regulations and the increased outsourcing of process knowledge the end users of water consist of a wide array of entities including farms mines power plants industrial facilities and residential homes these customers are predominately served through specialized distributors and original equipment manufacturers “oems” 

figure 1 water industry supply chain 

our business focuses on the beginning of the supply chain by providing technologyintensive equipment and services we sell our equipment and services via direct and indirect channels that serve the needs of each customer type on the utility side we provide the majority of our sales direct to customers with strong application expertise with the remaining amount going through distribution partners to end users of water we provide the majority of our sales through longstanding relationships with the world’s leading distributors with the remainder going direct to customers 

the equipment and services market addresses the key processes of the water industry which are best illustrated through the cycle of water as depicted in figure 2 below we believe this industry has two distinct sectors within the cycle of water water infrastructure and usage applications the key processes of this cycle begin when raw water is extracted by pumps which provide the necessary pressure and flow to move or transport this water from natural sources such as oceans groundwater lakes and rivers through pipes to treatment facilities treatment facilities can provide many forms of treatment such as filtration disinfection and desalination to remove solids bacteria and salt respectively throughout each of these stages analytical instruments test the water to ensure regulatory requirements are met so that it can be utilized by enduse customers a network of pipes and pumps again transports this clean water to where it is needed such as to crops for irrigation to power plants to provide cooling in industrial water or to an apartment building as drinking water in residential and commercial buildings after usage the wastewater is collected by a separate network of pipes and pumps and transported to a wastewater treatment facility where processes such as digestion deactivate and reduce the volume of solids and disinfection purifies effluent water once treated analytical instruments test the water to ensure regulatory requirements are met so that it can be discharged back to the environment thereby completing the cycle 

figure 2 cycle of water 

in the water infrastructure sector two primary end markets exist public utility and industrial the public utility market comprises public private and publicprivate institutions that handle water and wastewater for mostly residential and commercial purposes the industrial market involves the supply of water and removal of wastewater for industrial facilities we view the main macro drivers of this sector to be water quality the desire for energyefficient products water scarcity regulatory requirements and infrastructure needs for both the repair of aging systems in developed countries as well as new installations in emerging markets 

in the usage applications sector enduse customers fall into four main markets residential commercial industrial and agricultural homeowners represent the end users in the residential market owners and managers of properties such as apartment buildings retail stores institutional buildings restaurants schools hospitals and hotels are examples of end users in the commercial market the industrial market is wide ranging involving oems exploration and production firms and developers and managers of facilities operated by electrical power generators chemical manufacturers machine shops clothing manufacturers beverage dispensing and food processing firms and car washes the agricultural market end users are owners and operators of businesses such as crop and livestock farms aquaculture golf courses and other turf applications we believe population growth urbanization and regulatory requirements are the primary macro drivers of these markets as these trends drive the need for housing food community services and retail goods within growing city centers water reuse and conservation are driving the need for new technologies 

business strategy 

our strategy is to enhance shareholder value by providing distinctive solutions for our customers most important water productivity quality and resilience challenges enabling us to grow revenue organically and through strategic acquisitions as we streamline our cost structure key elements of our strategy are summarized below 

 

 

 

 

 

 business segments 

we have two reportable business segments that are aligned with the cycle of water and the key strategic market applications they provide water infrastructure collection distribution return and applied water usage see note 21  “segment and geographic data” in our consolidated financial statements for financial information about segments and geographic areas 

the table and descriptions below provide an overview of our business segments

distribution training and end use 

water infrastructure provides the majority of its sales through direct channels with remaining sales through indirect channels and service capabilities both public utility and industrial facility customers increasingly require our teams’ global but locally proficient expertise to use our equipment in their specific applications several trends are increasing the need for this application expertise i the increase in type and amount of contaminants in water supply ii increasing environmental regulations iii the need to increase system efficiencies to optimize energy costs and iv the retirement of a largely aging water industry workforce not systematically replaced at utilities 

in the applied water segment many enduse areas are widely different so specialized distribution partners are often preferred our commercial teams have built longstanding relationships around our brands in many of these industries through which we can continue to leverage new product and service applications revenue opportunities are balanced between oems and aftermarket customers our products in the applied water segment are sold through our global direct sales and strong indirect channels with the majority of revenue going through indirect channels we have longstanding relationships with many of the leading independent distributors in the markets we serve and we provide incentives to distributors such as specialized loyalty and training programs 

aftermarket parts and service 

during their lifecycle installed products require maintenance repair services and parts due to the harsh environments in which they operate we have many service centers around the world which employ service employees to provide aftermarket parts and services to our large installed base of customers service centers offer an array of integrated service solutions for the industry including preventive monitoring contract maintenance emergency field service engineered upgrades inventory management and overhauls for pumps and other rotating equipment 

depending on the type of product median lifecycles range from five years to over 50 years at which time they must be replaced many of our products are precisely selected and applied within a larger network of equipment driving a strong preference by customers and installers to replace them with the same exact brand and model when they reach the end of their lifecycle this dynamic establishes a large recurring revenue stream for our business 

supply and seasonality 

we have a global manufacturing footprint with production facilities in europe north america latin america and asia our inventory management and distribution practices seek to minimize inventory holding periods by striving to take delivery of the inventory and manufacturing as close as possible to the sale or distribution of products to our customers all of our businesses require various parts and raw materials of which the availability and prices may fluctuate parts and raw materials commonly used in our products include motors fabricated parts castings bearings seals nickel copper aluminum and plastics while we may recover some cost increases through operational improvements we are still exposed to some pricing risk we attempt to control costs through fixedpriced contracts with suppliers and various other programs such as our global strategic sourcing initiative 

our business relies on thirdparty suppliers contract manufacturing and commodity markets to secure raw materials parts and components used in our products we typically acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our materials requirements for most of our products we have existing alternate sources of supply or such sources are readily available 

we may experience price volatility or supply constraints for materials that are not available from multiple sources from time to time we acquire certain inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longerterm pricing commitments with vendors to improve the priority price and availability of supply there have been no raw material shortages that have had a significant adverse impact on our business as a whole 

our water infrastructure and applied water segments experience some modest level of seasonality in its business this seasonality is dependent on factors such as capital spending of customers as well as weather conditions including heavy flooding droughts and fluctuations in temperatures which can positively or negatively impact portions of our business 

customers 

our business is not dependent on any single customer or a few customers the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our water infrastructure or applied water segments or on the company as a whole no individual customer accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated 2014  2013  or 2012  revenue 

backlog 

delivery schedules vary from customer to customer based upon their requirements typically large projects require longer lead production cycles and delays can occur from time to time total backlog was 740 million  at december 31 2014  and 707 million  at december 31 2013  we anticipate that more than 85  of the backlog at december 31 2014  will be recognized as revenue during 2015  

competition 

given the highly fragmented nature of the water industry the water infrastructure segment competes with a large number of businesses competition in the water transport and treatment technologies markets focuses on product performance reliability and innovation application expertise brand reputation energy efficiency product life cycle cost timeliness of delivery proximity of service centers effectiveness of our distribution channels and price in the sale of products and services we benefit from our large installed base of pumps and complementary products which require maintenance repair and replacement parts due to the nature of the products and the conditions under which they operate timeliness of delivery quality and the proximity of service centers are important customer considerations when selecting a provider for aftermarket products and services as well as equipment rentals in geographic regions where we are locally positioned to provide a quick response customers have historically relied on us rather than our competitors for aftermarket products relating to our highly engineered and customized solutions our key competitors within the water infrastructure segment include ksb inc sulzer ltd evoqua water technologies formerly siemens ag and danaher corporation 

competition in the applied water segment focuses on brand equity application expertise product delivery and performance quality and price we compete by offering a wide variety of innovative and highquality products coupled with worldclass application expertise we believe our distribution through wellestablished channels and our reputation for quality significantly enhance our market position our ability to deliver innovative product offerings has allowed us to compete effectively to cultivate and maintain customer relationships and to serve and expand into many niche and new markets our key competitors within the applied water segment include grundfos wilo se pentair ltd and franklin electric co inc 

research and development 

research and development “rd” is a key element of our engineering culture and is generally focused on the design and development of products and application knowhow that anticipate customer needs and emerging trends our engineers are involved in new product development and improvement of existing products our businesses invest substantial resources for rd we anticipate we will continue to develop and invest in our rd capabilities to promote a steady flow of innovative highquality and reliable products and applications to further strengthen our position in the markets we serve we invested 104 million  104 million  and 106 million  for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively in rd 

we have engineering and research employees in technology centers around the world rd activities are initially conducted in our technology centers located in conjunction with some of our major manufacturing facilities to ensure an efficient development process we have a center of excellence in stockholm sweden with research development and engineering employees we have centers of excellence in india and china where we are accelerating the customization of our application expertise to local needs in the scaleup process our rd activities are conducted at our piloting and testing facilities or at strategic customer sites these piloting and testing facilities enable us to serve our strategic markets in each region of the world 

intellectual property 

we generally seek patent protection for those inventions and improvements that we believe will improve our competitive position we believe that our patents and applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and improving our return on research and development investments while we own control or license a significant number of patents trade secrets proprietary information trademarks trade names copyrights and other intellectual property rights which in the aggregate are of material importance to our business management believes that our business as a whole as well as each of our core business segments is not materially dependent on any one intellectual property right or related group of such rights 

patents patent applications and license agreements expire or terminate over time by operation of law in accordance with their terms or otherwise as the portfolio of our patents patent applications and license agreements has evolved over time we do not expect the expiration of any specific patent to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

environmental matters and regulation 

our manufacturing operations worldwide are subject to many requirements under environmental laws in the united states the environmental protection agency and similar state agencies administer laws and regulations concerning air emissions water discharges waste disposal environmental remediation and other aspects of environmental protection such environmental laws and regulations in the united states include for example the federal clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act environmental requirements significantly affect our operations we have established an internal program to address compliance with applicable environmental requirements and as a result management believes that we are in substantial compliance with current environmental regulations 

while environmental laws and regulations are subject to change such changes can be difficult to predict reliably and the timing of potential changes is uncertain management does not believe based on current circumstances that compliance costs pursuant to such regulations will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations however the effect of future legislative or regulatory changes could be material to our financial condition or results of operations 

accruals for environmental matters are recorded on a sitebysite basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on current law and existing technologies it can be difficult to estimate reliably the final costs of investigation and remediation due to various factors our accrued liabilities for these environmental matters represent the best estimates related to the investigation and remediation of environmental media such as water soil soil vapor air and structures as well as related legal fees based upon the facts and circumstances as currently known to us these estimates and related accruals are reviewed quarterly and updated for progress of investigation and remediation efforts and changes in facts and legal circumstances liabilities for these environmental expenditures are recorded on an undiscounted basis we do not anticipate these liabilities will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations we cannot make assurances that other sites or new details about sites known to us that could give rise to environmental liabilities with such material adverse effects on us will not be identified in the future at december 31 2014  we had estimated and accrued 5 million  related to environmental matters 

employees 

as of december 31 2014  xylem had approximately 12500  employees worldwide we have more than 3700 employees in the united states of whom approximately 17 are represented by labor unions and in certain foreign countries some of our employees are represented by work councils we believe that our facilities are in favorable labor markets with ready access to adequate numbers of workers and believe our relations with our employees are good

 item 1a risk factors 

in evaluating our business each of the following risks should be carefully considered along with all of the other information in this report and in our other filings with the sec should any of these risks and uncertainties develop into actual events our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

risks related to operational and external factors 

failure to compete successfully in our markets could adversely affect our business 

we provide products and services into competitive markets we believe the principal points of competition in our markets are product performance reliability and innovation application expertise brand reputation energy efficiency product life cycle cost timeliness of delivery proximity of service centers effectiveness of our distribution channels and price maintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment by us in manufacturing research and development engineering marketing customer service and support and our distribution networks we may not be successful in maintaining our competitive position our competitors may develop products that are superior to our products or may develop more efficient or effective methods of providing products and services or may adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies or evolving customer requirements pricing pressures also could cause us to adjust the prices of certain products to stay competitive we may not be able to compete successfully with our existing or new competitors failure to continue competing successfully or to win large contracts could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by global economic and financial market conditions 

we compete around the world in various geographic and product markets in 2014  38  35  and 21  of our total revenue was from customers located in the united states europe and emerging markets respectively we expect revenue from these markets to be significant for the foreseeable future important factors impacting our businesses include the overall strength of these economies and our customers’ confidence in both local and global macroeconomic conditions industrial and federal state local and municipal governmental spending the strength of the residential and commercial real estate markets interest rates availability of commercial financing for our customers and endusers and unemployment rates a slowdown or downturn in these financial or macroeconomic conditions could have a significant adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

economic and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our business 

in 2014  62  of our total revenue was from customers outside the united states with 21  of total revenue generated in emerging markets we expect our international operations sales and export sales to continue to be a significant portion of our revenue we have placed a particular emphasis on increasing our growth and presence in emerging markets both our sales from international operations and export sales are subject in varying degrees to risks inherent to doing business outside the united states these risks include the following 

 any payment of distributions loans or advances to us by our foreign subsidiaries could be subject to restrictions on or taxation of dividends on repatriation of earnings under applicable local law monetary transfer restrictions and foreign currency exchange regulations in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate in addition to the general risks that we face outside the united states we now conduct more of our operations in emerging markets than we have in the past which could involve additional uncertainties for us including risks that governments may impose limitations on our ability to repatriate funds governments may impose withholding or other taxes on 

remittances and other payments to us or the amount of any such taxes may increase an outbreak or escalation of any insurrection or armed conflict may occur governments may seek to nationalize our assets or governments may impose or increase investment barriers or other restrictions affecting our business in addition emerging markets pose other uncertainties including the protection of our intellectual property and other assets pressure on the pricing of our products higher business conduct risks less qualified talent and risks of political instability we cannot predict the impact such future largely unforeseeable events might have on our business financial condition and results of operations 

failure to comply with laws regulations and policies including the us foreign corrupt practices act or other applicable anticorruption legislation could result in fines criminal penalties and an adverse effect on our business 

we are subject to regulation under a wide variety of us federal and state and nonus laws regulations and policies including laws related to anticorruption export and import compliance antitrust and money laundering due to our global operations the us foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa the uk bribery act of 2010 and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business there has been an increase in antibribery law enforcement activity in recent years with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the department of justice doj and the sec increased enforcement activity by nonus regulators and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from improper conduct of our employees or business partners in the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees or agents have or may have violated applicable laws including anticorruption laws we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management any such violation could result in substantial fines sanctions civil andor criminal penalties and curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions and might adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition in addition actual or alleged violations could damage our reputation and ability to do business furthermore detecting investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations is expensive and can consume significant time and attention of our senior management 

our business could be adversely affected by the inability of suppliers to meet delivery requirements 

our business relies on thirdparty suppliers contract manufacturing and commodity markets to secure raw materials parts and components used in our products parts and raw materials commonly used in our products include motors fabricated parts castings bearings seals nickel copper aluminum and plastics we are exposed to the availability of these materials which may be subject to curtailment or change due to among other things interruptions in production by suppliers labor disputes the impaired financial condition of a particular supplier suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels ability to meet regulatory requirements weather emergencies or acts of war or terrorism any delay in our suppliers’ abilities to provide us with necessary materials could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers and accordingly could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our business could be adversely affected by significant movements in foreign currency exchange rates 

we conduct approximately 62  of our business in various locations outside the united states we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency transaction exchange rates particularly with respect to the euro swedish krona british pound australian dollar canadian dollar polish zloty and hungarian forint any significant change in the value of currencies of the countries in which we do business relative to the value of the us dollar or euro could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations additionally we are subject to foreign exchange translation risk due to changes in the value of foreign currencies in relation to our reporting currency the us dollar the translation risk is primarily concentrated in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro british pound chinese yuan swedish krona and canadian dollar as the us dollar fluctuates against other currencies in which we transact business revenue and income can be impacted refer to item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information on foreign exchange risk 

weather conditions may adversely affect our financial results 

weather conditions including heavy flooding droughts and fluctuations in temperatures can positively or negatively impact portions of our business within the dewatering space our pumps provided through our godwin and flygt brands are used to remove excess or unwanted water heavy flooding due to weather conditions drives increased demand for these applications on the other hand drought conditions drive higher demand for pumps used in agricultural and turf irrigation applications such as those provided by our goulds water technology flowtronex and lowara brands fluctuations to warmer and cooler temperatures result in varying levels of demand for products used in residential and commercial applications where homes and buildings are heated and cooled with hvac units such as those provided by our bg brand given the unpredictable nature of weather conditions this may result in volatility for certain portions of our business as well as the operations of certain of our customers and suppliers 

our financial results can be difficult to predict 

our business is impacted by an increasing amount of short cycle and bookandbill business which we have limited insight into particularly for the business that we transact through our distributors we are also impacted by large projects whose timing can change based upon customer requirements due to a number of factors affecting the project such as funding readiness of the project and regulatory approvals accordingly our financial results for any given period can be difficult to predict 

our strategy includes acquisitions and we may not be able to make acquisitions of suitable candidates or integrate acquisitions successfully 

our historical growth has included acquisitions as part of our growth strategy we plan to pursue the acquisition of other companies assets and product lines that either complement or expand our existing business we cannot make assurances however that we will be able to identify suitable candidates successfully negotiate appropriate acquisition terms obtain financing that may be needed to consummate those acquisitions complete proposed acquisitions successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or expand into new markets in addition we cannot make assurances that any acquisition once successfully integrated will perform as planned be accretive to earnings or prove to be beneficial to our operations or cash flow 

acquisitions involve a number of risks and present financial managerial and operational challenges including diversion of management attention from existing businesses and operations integration of technology operations personnel and financial and other systems potentially insufficient internal controls over financial activities or financial reporting at an acquired entity that could impact us on a combined basis the failure to realize expected synergies the possibility that we have acquired substantial undisclosed liabilities and the loss of key employees of the acquired businesses 

we may incur impairment charges for our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets which would negatively impact our operating results 

we have a significant amount of goodwill and purchased intangible assets on our balance sheet as a result of acquisitions we have completed as of december 31 2014  the net carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets totaled approximately 2 billion  the carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of an acquired business in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date the carrying value of indefinitelived intangible assets represents the fair value of trademarks and trade names as of the acquisition date we do not amortize goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets that we expect to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows but instead we evaluate these assets for impairment at least annually or more frequently if interim indicators suggest that a potential impairment could exist in testing for impairment we will make a qualitative assessment and if we believe that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the quantitative twostep goodwill impairment test is required significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets divestitures and market capitalization declines may impair our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets any charges relating to such impairments could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in the periods recognized 

our ability to successfully execute our organizational redesign as well as other restructuring and realignment actions could impact our business results 

we initiated an organizational redesign during the fourth quarter of 2013 shifting from individually managed businesses to an integrated approach within geographical regions we expect that this will enable us to leverage the breadth of the company’s product and services portfolio to better serve our customers and address market opportunities as well as effectively utilize internal support organizations to realize economies of scale and efficient use of resources the successful implementation and execution of this redesign as well as our other restructuring and realignment actions is critical to achieving our expected cost savings as well as effectively competing in the marketplace other factors that may impede a successful implementation is retention of key employees the impact of regulatory matters and adverse economic market conditions if the organizational redesign or restructuring and realignment actions are not executed successfully the company’s financial results could be adversely impacted 

changes in our effective tax rates may adversely affect our financial results 

we sell our products in more than 150 countries and 62  of our revenue was generated outside the united states in 2014  given the global nature of our business a number of factors may increase our future effective tax rates including 

 any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could reduce net income for future periods 

our business could be adversely affected by inflation and other manufacturing and operating cost increases 

our operating costs are subject to fluctuations particularly due to changes in commodity prices raw materials energy and related utilities freight and cost of labor in order to remain competitive we may not be able to recuperate all or a portion of these higher costs from our customers through product price increases further our ability to realize financial benefits from lean six sigma projects may not be able to mitigate fully or in part these manufacturing and operating cost increases and as a result could negatively impact our profitability 

product defects and unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure with respect to our products could adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements 

manufacturing or design defects in including in products or components that we source from third parties unanticipated use of or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of products that we make or sell can lead to personal injury death or property damage these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products result in the removal of a product from the market and result in product liability claims being brought against us although we have liability insurance we cannot be certain that this insurance coverage will continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost or will be adequate to cover any product liability claims recalls removals and product liability claims can result in significant costs as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products 

our indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operational flexibility 

as of december 31 2014  our total outstanding indebtedness was 1288 million  including our 355 senior notes of 600 million aggregate principal amount due september 2016 and 4875 senior notes of 600 million aggregate principal amount due october 2021 we have an existing four year competitive advance and revolving credit facility the “credit facility” which provides for an aggregate principal amount of up to 600 million we have a risk sharing finance facility agreement the rd facility agreement with the european investment bank eib in an aggregate principal amount of up to €120 million  approximately 146 million  

our indebtedness could 

 in addition there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available to us on favorable terms or at all for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness if we incur additional debt or raise equity through the issuance of preferred stock the terms of the debt or preferred stock issued may give the holders rights preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock particularly in the event of liquidation the terms of the debt may also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on our operations than we currently have 

our ability to make scheduled principal payments of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance which may be affected by factors beyond our control if we are unable to service our indebtedness our business financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 

we may be negatively impacted by litigation and regulatory proceedings 

we are subject to laws regulations and potential liability relating to claims complaints and proceedings including those related to antitrust environmental product and other matters 

we are subject to various laws ordinances regulations and other requirements of government authorities in foreign countries and in the united states any violation of which could potentially create substantial liability for us and also damage to our reputation changes in laws ordinances regulations or other government policies the nature timing and effect of which are uncertain may significantly increase our expenses and liabilities 

from time to time we are involved in legal proceedings that are incidental to the operation of our businesses including acquisitions and divestitures some of these proceedings seek remedies relating to environmental matters intellectual property matters product liability and personal injury claims employment labor and pension matters and government and commercial or contract issues sometimes related to acquisitions or divestitures we may become subject to significant claims of which we are currently unaware or the claims of which we are aware may result in our incurring a significantly greater liability than we anticipate or can estimate additionally we may receive fines or penalties or be required to change or cease operations at one or more facilities if a regulatory agency determines that we have failed to comply with laws regulations or orders applicable to our business 

our business could be adversely affected by interruptions in information technology communications networks and operations or cybersecurity threats 

our business operations rely on information technology and communications networks and operations that are vulnerable to damage or disturbance from a variety of sources regardless of protection measures essentially all systems are susceptible to disruption due to failure vandalism computer viruses security breaches natural disasters power outages and other events in addition cybersecurity threats are evolving and include among others malicious software attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in our systems or our third party vendors’ systems and applications unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data we also have a concentration of operations on certain sites eg production and shared services centers where business interruptions could cause material damage and costs transport of goods from suppliers and to customers could also be hampered for the reasons stated above although we continue to assess these risks implement controls and perform business continuity planning we cannot be sure that interruptions with material adverse effects will not occur 

failure to retain our existing senior management engineering sales and other key personnel or the inability to attract and retain new qualified personnel could negatively impact our ability to operate or grow our business 

our success will continue to depend to a significant extent on our ability to retain or attract a significant number of employees in senior management engineering sales and other key personnel the ability to attract or retain employees will depend on our ability to offer competitive compensation training and cultural benefits we will need to continue to develop a roster of qualified talent to support business growth and replace departing employees effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution a failure to retain or attract highly skilled personnel could adversely affect our operating results or ability to operate or grow our business 

if we do not or cannot adequately protect our intellectual property if third parties infringe our intellectual property rights or if third parties claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights we may suffer competitive injury expend significant resources enforcing our rights or defending against such claims or be prevented from selling products or services 

we own numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others which in aggregate are important to our business the intellectual property rights that we obtain however may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage because they may not be sufficiently broad or may be challenged invalidated circumvented independently developed or designedaround particularly in countries where intellectual property rights laws are not highly developed protected or enforced our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we receive notices from third parties alleging intellectual property infringement or misappropriation any dispute or litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation in addition as a result of such claims of infringement or misappropriation we could lose our rights   to critical technology be unable to license critical technology or sell critical products and services be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights or be required to redesign our products at substantial cost any of which could adversely impact our competitive position and financial statements even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation we may incur significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we cannot make assurances that we will pay dividends on our common stock or continue to repurchase our common stock under board approved share repurchase plans and likewise our indebtedness could limit our ability to pay dividends or make share repurchases 

the timing declaration amount and payment of future dividends to our shareholders fall within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on many factors including our financial condition results of operations and capital requirements as well as applicable law regulatory constraints industry practice and other business considerations that our board of directors considers relevant there can be no assurance that we will pay a dividend in the future or continue to pay dividends 

further the timing and amount of the repurchase of our common stock under board approved share repurchase plans has similar dependencies as the payment of dividends and accordingly there can be no assurances that we will continue to repurchase our common stock 

additionally if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our debt payment obligations then our ability to pay dividends if so determined by the board of directors or make share repurchases will be impaired and we may be required to attempt to restructure or refinance our debt raise additional capital or take other actions such as selling assets reducing or delaying capital expenditures reducing our dividend or delaying or curtailing share repurchases there can be no assurance however that any such actions could be effected on satisfactory terms if at all or would be permitted by the terms of our debt or our other credit and contractual arrangements 

the level of returns on postretirement benefit plan assets changes in interest rates and other factors could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods 

certain members of our current and retired employee population are covered by pension and other employeerelated defined benefit plans collectively postretirement benefit plans we may experience significant fluctuations in costs related to our postretirement benefit plans as a result of macroeconomic factors such as interest rates that are beyond our control the cost of our postretirement plans is incurred over long periods of time and involves factors and uncertainties during those periods which can be volatile and unpredictable including rates of return on postretirement benefit plan assets discount rates used to calculate liabilities and expenses and rates of future compensation increases management develops each assumption using relevant plan and company experience and expectations in conjunction with marketrelated data our liquidity financial position including shareholders’ equity and results of operations could be materially affected by significant changes in key economic indicators actuarial experience financial market volatility future legislation and other governmental regulatory actions 

we make contributions to fund our postretirement benefit plans when considered necessary or advantageous to do so the macroeconomic factors discussed above including the return on postretirement benefit plan assets and the minimum funding requirements established by local government funding or taxing authorities or established by other agreement may influence future funding requirements a significant decline in the fair value of our plan assets or other adverse changes to our overall pension and other employeerelated benefit plans could require us to make significant funding contributions and affect cash flows in future periods 

unforeseen environmental issues could impact our financial position or results of operations 

our operations are subject to and affected by many federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations in addition we could be affected by future environmental laws or regulations including for example those imposed in response to climate change concerns compliance with current and future environmental laws and regulations currently requires and is expected to continue to require operating and capital expenditures 

environmental laws and regulations may authorize substantial fines and criminal sanctions as well as facility shutdowns to address violations and may require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit emissions or discharges we also incur and expect to continue to incur costs to comply with current environmental laws and regulations 

developments such as the adoption of new environmental laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations violations by us of such laws and regulations discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination litigation involving environmental impacts our inability to recover costs associated with any such developments or financial insolvency of other responsible parties could in the future have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 

the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly 

we cannot predict the prices at which our common stock may trade the market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely depending on many factors some of which may be beyond our control including 

 23 

 stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents and indiana law could delay or prevent a change in control 

certain provisions of our third amended and restated articles of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may delay or prevent a merger or acquisition part or all of our business operations for example the third amended and restated articles of incorporation and the amended and restated bylaws among other things require advance notice for shareholder proposals and nominations and do not permit action by written consent of the shareholders unless unanimous in addition the amended and restated articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock these provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals of our business operations or delay or prevent a change in control which could harm our stock price indiana law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 10 or more of our outstanding common stock and us 

risks related to our 2011 spinoff from itt corporation 

the spinoff may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal distribution requirements 

the spinoff could be challenged under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws an unpaid creditor or an entity vested with the power of such creditor such as a trustee or debtorinpossession in a bankruptcy could claim that the spinoff left us itt andor exelis insolvent or with unreasonably small capital or that we itt andor exelis intended or believed it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay as they mature and that itt did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value in the spinoff if a court were to agree with such a plaintiff then such court could void the spinoff as a fraudulent transfer and could impose a number of different remedies which could adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations 

in connection with our spinoff itt and exelis will indemnify us for certain liabilities and we will indemnify itt or exelis for certain liabilities if we are required to indemnify itt or exelis we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations and our financial results could be negatively impacted in the case of itts or exeliss indemnity there can be no assurance that those indemnities will be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of such liabilities or as to itts or exeliss ability to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future 

pursuant to the distribution agreement and certain other agreements with itt and exelis itt and exelis agreed to indemnify us from certain liabilities and we agreed to indemnify itt and exelis for certain liabilities indemnities that we may be required to provide itt and exelis may be significant and could negatively impact our business particularly indemnities relating to our actions that could impact the taxfree nature of the spinoff third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that itt or exelis has agreed to retain further there can be no assurance that the indemnities from itt and exelis will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities or that itt and exelis will be able to fully satisfy their indemnification obligations moreover even if we ultimately were to succeed in recovering from itt and exelis any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves each of these risks could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition

executive summary 

xylem reported revenue for 2014  of 3916 million  an increase of 21  from 3837 million  reported in 2013  significant growth in the industrial and public utility end markets combined with strength in the emerging markets most notably in china drove the increase continued challenging market conditions limited growth in other regions europe for example was flat organically yearoveryear while japan and australia declined operating income for 2014  was 463 million  reflecting an increase of 100 million  or 275  compared to 363 million  in 2013  which was primarily due to savings from lean six sigma activities global sourcing initiatives and restructuring actions as well as lapping 24 million  in nonrecurring special charges in 2013 which more than offset headwinds from cost inflation and unfavorable sales mix additionally restructuring and realignment cost actions taken to improve the overall cost base of the business were 43 million  in 2014 as compared to 64 million  in the prior year 

additional financial highlights for 2014  include the following 

 2015  business outlook 

in 2015 we are anticipating organic revenue growth of low single digits the projected organic growth excludes an expected negative foreign exchange translation impact on growth of high single digits primarily driven by a weaker euro to us dollar we expect continued strength in the united states industrial markets but a modest deceleration in emerging market growth and weakness in the oil and gas markets to result in low single digit growth overall for the industrial end market we expect public utilities to also increase at low single digits where emerging market infrastructure investments continue to bolster growth and we see improving market conditions in the united states in the commercial market we anticipate growth of low to midsingle digits as the united states appears to continue to slowly recover and emerging markets continue to be strong which we expect will be partially offset by soft european markets we believe the residential markets will be flat to down low single digits as the united states markets moderate and europe continues to be negative finally the agriculture markets which is our smallest end market we expect will likely be relatively flat compared to 2014 as we are expecting slower growth in the united states from lapping of a strong 2014 combined with stabilization in europe and continued strength in emerging markets 

we will continue to execute restructuring and realignment actions to reposition our european and north american business to optimize our cost structure and improve our operational efficiency and effectiveness during 2014 we incurred 26 million and 17 million in restructuring and realignment costs respectively as a result of the restructuring actions in 2014 we realized 13 million of net savings in 2015 we expect to incur approximately 20 million in restructuring and realignment costs we expect to realize approximately 16 million of incremental net savings in 2015 from actions initiated in 2014 and an additional 2 million of net savings from our 2015 actions additional strategic actions we are taking include strategic initiatives to drive abovemarket growth advance continuous improvement activities to increase productivity focus on improving cash performance and drive a disciplined capital deployment strategy

2014  versus 2013   

revenue 

revenue generated for 2014  was 3916 million  an increase of 79 million  or 21  compared to 3837 million  in 2013  on a constant currency basis revenue grew 33  the following table illustrates the impact on 2014  revenue from organic growth recent acquisitions and fluctuations in foreign currency 



 35 

the following table summarizes revenue by segment for 2014  and 2013  

water infrastructure 

water infrastructure’s revenue increased 58 million  or 24  in 2014   44  on a constant currency basis the 44  constant currency increase reflects growth within the industrial water and public utility end markets and 6 million  of incremental revenue from our 2013 acquisitions 

organic revenue increased 99 million  or 42  during the year which was substantially due to higher volumes in transport test and treatment applications revenue from transport applications grew primarily from increased industrial dewatering applications in the united states from oil and gas marketrelated rental activities transport also grew organically from public utility pump and aftermarket demand revenue from test applications increased due to significant strength in the united states from increased government spending coupled with the continued success of new products and crossselling of our european technologies revenue from treatment applications grew from the delivery of several large projects in the emerging markets particularly in latin america partially offset by lower deliverable project backlog in the united states and european markets 

applied water 

applied water’s revenue increased 21 million  or 14  in 2014  a 16  increase on a constant currency basis the growth on a constant currency basis is driven primarily by organic revenue growth of 35 million  or 24  versus the prior year due to strength in the commercial building services industrial water and agriculture end markets which more than offset declines in the residential building services the increase in the current year was partially offset by the absence of revenue from our wolverhampton valves business following its divestiture in the third quarter of 2014  as compared to 12 million  of revenue for the comparative period in 2013 

organic revenue increased 35 million  or 24  for the year due primarily to commercial building recovery in the united states institutional building market including distributor restocking and promotional activity also contributing to the organic growth was industrial water application strength across all regions particularly from projects in the middle east and latin america irrigation application revenue also grew driven by the timing of project shipments and increased demand for vertical turbines a decline in european demand for residential applications partially offset organic growth 

ordersbacklog 

orders received during 2014  increased by 109 million  or 28  to  4021 million  a 39  increase on a constant currency basis organic order growth increased 153 million  or 39  for the year 

water infrastructure segment orders increased 68 million  or 28  to 2511 million   44  growth on a constant currency basis including 8 million  from acquisitions organic order growth of 41 was primarily due to higher industrial demand within transport for wastewater pumps in the united states and europe as well as strength within the dewatering business for rental and equipment sales into oil and gas markets orders for test applications also bolstered the growth for the segment from large orders in the united states the strength in transport and test offset declines in treatment from project delays in the united states and europe 

orders increased in our applied water segment 41 million  or 28  to 1510 million   30  growth on a constant currency basis organic growth of 36 was driven by strong performance in the commercial building services and industrial water markets in the united states as well as continued strength in china the growth was partially offset by weakness in the residential markets of europe 

delivery schedules vary from customer to customer based upon their requirements typically large projects require longer lead production cycles and delays can occur from time to time total backlog was 740 million  at december 31 2014  and 707 million  at december 31 2013  we anticipate that more than 85  of the backlog at december 31 2014  will be recognized as revenue during 2015  

gross margin 

gross margins as a percentage of consolidated revenue declined to 386  in 2014  from 391  in 2013  the decrease is primarily attributable to lower margin sales within the water infrastructure segment caused by higher mix sold to emerging markets which have lower margins in conjunction with foreign exchange headwinds as well as unfavorable product sales mix these negative impacts were partially mitigated by benefits from restructuring savings and costsaving initiatives through lean six sigma and global sourcing across both segments

sga decreased by 66 million  or 67  to 920 million  or 235  of revenue in 2014  as compared to 986 million  or 257  of revenue in 2013  the decrease in sga expenses as a percentage of revenue is due primarily to savings from restructuring actions combined with lapping the impacts from nonrecurring special charges in 2013 of 24 million  which comprise the legal settlement with xylem group llc costs incurred for the change in our chief executive officer costs incurred for the contractual indemnification of federal tax obligations to itt and costs associated with a legal judgment arising from a historical acquisition matter the decrease was also driven by 7 million less realignment costs in 2014  which were costs incurred by the company to reposition our european business in an effort to optimize our cost structure and improve our operational efficiency and effectiveness as well as implement our new organizational structure 

research and development expenses 

rd spending was flat at 104 million  or 27  of revenue in both 2014  and 2013  

restructuring and asset impairment charges 

during 2014  we incurred restructuring costs of 19 million  6 million  and 1 million in our water infrastructure and applied water segments and corporate and other respectively these charges were incurred primarily in an effort to realign our organizational structure in europe and north america to optimize our cost structure the charges relate to the reduction in structural costs including a decrease in headcount and consolidation of facilities during 2013  we recognized restructuring costs of 31 million and 9 million in our water infrastructure and applied water segments respectively these charges were incurred primarily in an effort to realign our organizational structure in europe and north america to address declines in sales volumes and optimize our cost structure the charges relate to the reduction in structural costs including a decrease in headcount and consolidation of facilities 

total expected costs associated with actions that commenced during 2014 are approximately 22 million for water infrastructure approximately 10 million for applied water and approximately 1 million for corporate and other these costs primarily comprise severance charges the water infrastructure and applied water actions are expected to continue through 2015 the corporate and other actions are complete as a result of these actions initiated in 2014 we achieved savings of approximately 13 million in 2014 and estimate annual future net savings beginning in 2015 of approximately 29 million 

additionally in the fourth quarter of 2013 we recorded a 2 million impairment charge related to three trade names in our water infrastructure segment associated with acquired businesses within our analytics operating unit reflecting a decline in their value since being acquired refer to note 11  “goodwill and other intangible assets” for additional information 

operating income 

we generated operating income of 463 million  during 2014  a 100 million  or 275  increase from the prior year operating income of 363 million  primarily reflecting costsaving initiatives and savings from restructuring actions these benefits were partially offset by cost inflation combined with unfavorable impacts from our geographic and product sales mix described above another driving factor in the yearoveryear improvement was the absence of the aforementioned special charges in 2013  within sga which did not recur as well as lower restructuring and realignment costs the following table illustrates operating income results by business segments for 2014  and 2013  



the table included below provides a reconciliation from segment operating income to adjusted operating income and a calculation of the corresponding adjusted operating margin 



nm not meaningful percentage change 

water infrastructure 

operating income for our water infrastructure segment increased 58 million  or 221  increased 35 million  or 111  on an adjusted basis compared with the prior year the 111  increase was primarily driven by higher volume restructuring savings and cost reduction initiatives such as global sourcing and lean six sigma the increase was partially offset by cost inflation unfavorable sales mix and price 

applied water 

operating income for our applied water segment increased 18 million  or 103  increased 15 million  or 79  on an adjusted basis compared to the prior year the 79  increase was driven by lean six sigma initiatives global sourcing and restructuring savings combined with modest price realization the increase was partially offset by cost inflation and unfavorable foreign exchange headwinds 

interest expense 

interest expense was 54 million  and 55 million  for 2014  and 2013  respectively primarily related to interest expense on 12 billion aggregate principal amount of our senior notes refer to note 14  “credit facilities and longterm debt” for further details 

income tax expense 

the income tax provision for 2014  was 84 million  at an effective tax rate of 198  compared to 70 million  at an effective tax rate of 235  in 2013  the 2014  effective tax rate is lower than 2013  due primarily to geographic mix of earnings 

other comprehensive incomeloss 

other comprehensive loss before tax of 284 million  in 2014  as compared to income of 74 million  in 2013  was primarily due to a 221 million foreign currency translation impact due to a weakening of the euro british pound and swedish krona against the us dollar further contributing to the yearoveryear decline was a 110 million  net loss in postretirement benefit plans in 2014 as compared to a net gain of 34 million  in 2013 due to a decrease in discount rates partially mitigated by actual gains on plan assets in excess of the assumed longterm rate of return the effective tax rate on other comprehensive income decreased as compared to 2013 due primarily to the shift in comprehensive earnings from foreign currency translation which is not taxable as well as from a change in the jurisdictional mix of net gains and losses from postretirement benefit plans

 the following table summarizes revenue by segment for 2013 and 2012 

water infrastructure 

water infrastructure’s revenue increased 35 million or 15 in 2013 17 on a constant currency basis our 2012 and 2013 acquisitions contributed 82 million of incremental revenue in 2013 

organic revenue decreased 43 million or 18 during the year which was due substantially to lower volumes across the transport treatment and test applications the significant declines were caused primarily by weakness in the europe middle east and africa treatment markets and declines in transport in the asia pacific markets from less mining activity organic revenue performance improved yearoveryear in the third and fourth quarters of 2013 driven by increases in transport revenue which reflected modest market recovery in northern and central europe as well as the united states treatment negatively impacted organic growth for the year as revenue decreased from 2012 due substantially to nonrecurring large custom projects shipped in the prior year as well as project delays from government funding uncertainties additionally test applications which had flat organic revenue in 2013 experienced lower revenue for the year from delays in orders and the government sequestration in the united states during the first half of 2013 which were offset by revenue growth in the second half of the year specifically in europe as well as incremental revenue from price increases new products and crossbranding initiatives 

applied water 

applied water’s revenue increased 11 million or 08 in 2013 a 03 increase on a constant currency basis the growth on a constant currency basis was driven by organic revenue growth predominately due to irrigation and industrial water applications 

organic revenue increased 4 million or 03 for the year due primarily to irrigation application revenue caused by drought conditions in the united states strength in the industrial water application also bolstered revenue particularly within china from large fire pump projects as well as in northern europe from increased industrial multistage pump revenue these revenue increases were partially offset by weakness in europe particularly within the residential and commercial building services markets of southern europe combined with sluggish industrial and commercial building service markets in the united states and latin america 

ordersbacklog 

orders received during 2013 increased by 130 million or 34 to 3912 million a 34 increase on a constant currency basis these amounts include a benefit of 87 million from acquisitions organic order growth was 43 million for the year 

the water infrastructure segment orders increased 79 million or 33 to 2443 million 36 growth on a constant currency basis including 87 million from acquisitions orders increased slightly on a constant currency basis due primarily to a strong second half of 2013 driven by higher transport volume from europe public utilities and the dewatering business combined with healthy growth in emerging markets orders increased in our applied water segment 51 million or 36 to 1469 million 32 growth on a constant currency basis driven by strong performance in the commercial building services and industrial water markets in china as well as orders within the residential building services and agriculture markets in the united states during 2013 partially offset by weakness in southern europe across all end markets 

delivery schedules vary from customer to customer based upon their requirements typically large projects require longer lead production cycles and delays can occur from time to time total backlog was 707 million at december 31 2013 and 647 million at december 31 2012 

gross margin 

gross margins as a percentage of consolidated revenue declined to 391 in 2013 from 396 in 2012 the decrease is attributable to negative price realization geographic sales mix and additional costs associated with recent acquisitions these negative impacts were partially mitigated by benefits from restructuring savings and cost saving initiatives such as lean six sigma and global sourcing

selling general and administrative expenses 

sga increased by 72 million or 79 to 986 million or 257 of revenue in 2013 as compared to 914 million or 241 of revenue in 2012 the increase in sga expenses as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to the combined impacts from the legal settlement with xylem group llc and costs incurred for the change in our chief executive officer of 20 million the increase was also driven by realignment costs of 17 million during 2013 incurred by the company to reposition our european business in an effort to optimize our cost structure and improve our operational efficiency and effectiveness acquisitions increased pension costs and investments in growth platforms also contributed to the increase

operating income for our water infrastructure segment decreased 71 million or 213 decreased 42 million or 118 on an adjusted basis compared with the prior year the 118 decrease was driven by lower volume inflation unfavorable foreign exchange impacts costs associated with the establishment of our european headquarters and investments in growth platforms specifically acquisitions and new product launches the decrease was partially offset by restructuring savings and cost reduction initiatives such as global sourcing and lean six sigma 

applied water 

operating income for our applied water segment decreased 3 million or 17 increased 6 million or 32 on an adjusted basis compared to the prior year the 32 increase was driven by lean initiatives global sourcing and price realization partially offset by inflation and new product development 

interest expense 

interest expense was 55 million for both 2013 and 2012 reflecting the same full year of interest expense related to the issuance of 12 billion aggregate principal amount of our senior notes refer to note 14 “credit facilities and longterm debt” for further details 

income tax expense 

the income tax provision for 2013 was 70 million at an effective tax rate of 235 compared to 91 million at an effective tax rate of 234 in 2012 the 2013 effective tax rate is higher than 2012 due to an increase in foreign repatriations partially offset by mix of earnings 

other comprehensive incomeloss 

other comprehensive income before tax of 74 million in 2013 compared to a loss of 30 million in 2012 an improvement of 104 million was primarily due to a 34 million net gain in 2013 as compared to a net loss of 84 million in 2012 related to postretirement benefit plans the net gain in 2013 was due to an increase in discount rates as well as actual gains on plan assets in excess of the assumed longterm rate of return as compared to the net loss in 2012 which was due to a reduction in discount rates partially mitigated by actual gains on plan assets in excess of the assumed longterm rate of return this yearoveryear improvement was partially offset by a 33 million reduction in foreign currency translation benefit primarily due to the euro swedish krona and british pound strengthening against the us dollar the effective tax rate on other comprehensive income decreased as compared to 2012 due primarily to the shift in comprehensive earnings from foreign currency translation which is not taxable as well as from a change in the jurisdictional mix of net gains and losses from postretirement benefit plans 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash 



 sources and uses of liquidity 

operating activities 

during 2014  net cash provided by operating activities was 416 million  compared to 324 million  in 2013  the 92 million  yearoveryear increase was driven by an increase in income as well as a modest improvement in working capital performance reductions in payments made for restructuring and postretirement plan contributions in 2014 were largely offset by an increase in tax payments also contributing to the increase was a refund of valueadded tax in the current year that had been paid during 2013 

during 2013  net cash provided by operating activities was 324 million  compared to 396 million  in 2012  the 72 million  yearoveryear decrease was driven by an increase in the use of working capital in both segments due to increased accounts receivable primarily from longer collection times in europe and increased inventories to support a higher backlog as well as to be able to support shorter lead times additionally revenue volume declines during the first half of 2013 reduced cash inflow from income payments made for restructuring and realignment activities in 2013 also contributed to the decline largely offset by lower tax payments 

investing activities 

cash used in investing activities was 86 million  for 2014  compared to 199 million  in 2013  the decrease of 113 million was primarily driven by a decrease in acquisition activity as there were no acquisitions in 2014 whereas we spent 81 million for the acquisitions during 2013 also contributing to the decrease was the receipt of 30 million in 2014 for the sale of a business capital expenditures were also lower in 2014 with a 7 million reduction primarily due to a decrease in the spending on post spinoff information technology investments and the relocation of our corporate headquarters 

cash used in investing activities was 199 million in 2013 compared to 147 million  in 2012  the changes in investing activities are driven almost entirely by acquisitions activity and to a lesser extent from changes in spending on capital expenditures cash used for acquisitions was 81 million in 2013 compared to 41 million during 2012 capital expenditures were 126 million in 2013 and 112 million in 2012 the increase in capital expenditures were primarily due to information technology investments within both the applied water segment and corporate as a result of system requirements subsequent to the spinoff in addition to capital expenditures required for the relocation of our corporate headquarters as required by the spinoff from itt 

financing activities 

cash used by financing activities was 147 million  100 million  and 74 million  during 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively the increases in cash used for financing activities was primarily driven by an increase in share repurchase activity and dividend payments in 2014 share repurchase activity increased 61 million and dividend payments increased 7 million compared to 2013 additionally there was an increase in shortterm debt for borrowings under the european investment bank facility of 50 million in 2014 versus 38 million in 2013 in 2013 increases in share repurchase activity and dividend payments were 60 million and 12 million respectively compared to 2012 the 2013 share repurchase activity was impacted by 50 million of repurchases under a new share repurchase program approved on august 20 2013 by the board of directors to repurchase up to 250 million in shares 

funding and liquidity strategy 

our ability to fund our capital needs depends on our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access to the bank and capital markets 

our global funding requirements are continually monitored with appropriate strategies executed to ensure liquidity needs are met cost effectively based on our current global cash positions cash flows from operations and access to the commercial paper markets we believe there is sufficient liquidity to meet our funding requirements in addition our existing committed credit facilities and access to the public debt markets would provide further liquidity if required 

historically we have generated operating cash flow sufficient to fund our primary cash needs centered on operating activities working capital capital expenditures and strategic investments if our cash flows from operations are less than we expect we may need to incur debt or issue equity from time to time we may need to access the longterm and shortterm capital markets to obtain financing our access to and the availability of financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors including i our credit ratings or absence of a credit rating ii the liquidity of the overall capital markets and iii the current state of the economy there can be no assurance that we will continue to have access to the capital markets on terms acceptable to us or that financing will be available at all 

we anticipate that our present sources of funds including funds from operations will provide us with sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet our global liquidity and capital needs over the next twelve months 

senior notes 

on september 20 2011 we issued 3550 senior notes of 600 million aggregate principal amount due september 2016 the senior notes due 2016 and 4875 senior notes of 600 million aggregate principal amount due october 2021 the senior notes due 2021 and together with the senior notes due 2016 the senior notes

as of december 31 2014  this credit facility remains undrawn our intention is to renew the credit facility in 2015 

research and development facility agreement 

on december 4 2013 the company amended and restated its risk sharing finance facility agreement the rd facility agreement with the european investment bank the eib to add an additional borrower under the facility the facility provides an aggregate principal amount of up to   €120 million   approximately 146 million  to finance research projects and infrastructure development in the european union the companys whollyowned subsidiaries in luxembourg xylem holdings sárl and xylem international sárl are the borrowers under the rd facility agreement the obligations of the borrowers under the rd facility agreement are guaranteed by the company under an amended and restated deed of guarantee dated as of december 4 2013 in favor of the eib the funds are available to finance research and development projects during the period from 2013 through 2016 at the companys rd facilities in sweden germany italy the united kingdom austria norway and hungary 

under the rd facility agreement the borrower can draw loans on or before june 14 2015 with a maturity of no longer than 12 years the rd facility agreement provides for fixed rate loans and floating rate loans the interest rate per annum applicable to fixed rate loans will be at a fixed percentage rate per annum specified by the eib which includes the applicable margin the interest rate per annum applicable to floating rate loans will be at the rate determined by reference to euribor for loans drawn in euros and libor for loans drawn in pounds sterling or us dollars plus an applicable spread specified by the eib which includes the applicable margin the applicable margin for both fixed rate loans and floating rate loans shall be determined by reference to the credit rating of the company

as of december 31 2014  84 million   was outstanding under the rd facility agreement  although the borrowing term for this arrangement is for five years we have classified it as shortterm debt on our consolidated balance sheet since we intend to repay this obligation in less than one year 

nonus operations 

for both 2014  and 2013  we generated 62  of our revenue from nonus operations as we continue to grow our operations in the emerging markets and elsewhere outside of the united states we expect to continue to generate significant revenue from nonus operations and we expect our cash will be predominately held by our foreign subsidiaries we expect to manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed we may transfer cash from certain international subsidiaries to the us and other international subsidiaries when it is cost effective to do so our intent is to indefinitely reinvest all but 65 million  of these funds outside of the united states however we continually review our domestic and foreign cash profile expected future cash generation and investment opportunities that support our current designation of these funds as being indefinitely reinvested and reassess whether there is a demonstrated need to repatriate funds held internationally to support our us operations if as a result of our review it is determined that all or a portion of the funds may be needed for our operations in the united states we would be required to accrue us taxes related to future tax payments associated with the repatriation of these funds as of december 31 2014  our foreign subsidiaries were holding 537 million in cash or marketable securities 

as of december 31 2014  our excess of financial reporting over the tax basis of investments in certain foreign subsidiaries totaled 19 billion  we have not asserted that 65 million  of our excess basis difference will be indefinitely reinvested and have therefore provided for united states or additional foreign withholding taxes for that portion generally such amounts become subject to us taxation upon the remittance of dividends and under certain other circumstances 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual commitments as of december 31 2014  



in addition to the amounts presented in the table above we have recorded liabilities for uncertain tax positions of 44 million  these amounts have been excluded from the contractual obligations table due to an inability to reasonably estimate the timing of such payments in individual years further benefit payments which reflect expected future service related to the companys pension and other postretirement employee benefit obligations are presented in note 15  “postretirement benefit plans” and not included in the above table finally estimated environmental payments are excluded from the table above we estimate based on historical experience that we will spend approximately 1 million to 2 million per year on environmental investigation and remediation at december 31 2014  we had estimated and accrued 5 million  related to environmental matters 

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2014  we have issued guarantees for the debt and other obligations of consolidated subsidiaries in the normal course of business we have determined that none of these arrangements has a material current effect or is reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our consolidated financial statements liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 

significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are discussed in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they are inherently uncertain involve significant judgments include areas where different estimates reasonably could have been used and changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable however actual results in these areas could differ from management’s estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

revenue recognition  we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured for product sales delivery does not occur until the products have been shipped risk of loss has been transferred to the customer and the contractual terms have been fulfilled in instances where contractual terms include a provision for customer acceptance revenue is recognized when either i we have previously demonstrated that the product meets the specified criteria based on either seller or customerspecified objective criteria or ii upon formal acceptance received from the customer where the product has not been previously demonstrated to meet customerspecified objective criteria revenue on service and repair contracts is recognized after services have been agreed to by the customer and rendered 

we enter into contracts to sell our products and services and while the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions certain agreements contain multiple elements or nonstandard terms and conditions where sales agreements contain multiple elements or nonstandard terms and conditions judgment is required to determine the appropriate accounting including whether the deliverables specified in these agreements should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes and if so how the transaction price should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize revenue for each element when a sale involves multiple deliverables the total revenue from the arrangement is allocated to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price of the deliverable to all other deliverables in the contract revenue for multiple element arrangements is recognized when the appropriate revenue recognition criteria for the individual deliverable have been satisfied the allocation of sales price between elements may impact the timing of revenue recognition but will not change the total revenue recognized on the arrangement for delivered elements accounted for as separate units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement revenue is recognized only when the delivered elements have standalone value there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance and there are no customernegotiated refund or return rights affecting the sales recognized 

we record a reduction in revenue at the time of sale for estimated product returns rebates and other allowances based on historical experience and known trends 

warranty accrual  accruals for estimated expenses related to warranties are made at the time products are sold or services are rendered and are recorded as a component of cost of revenue these accruals are established using historical information on the nature frequency and average cost of warranty claims and consider any factors that may cause differences in expected future warranty costs as compared to historical claim experience while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes we base our estimated warranty obligation on product warranty terms offered to customers ongoing product failure rates material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure as well as specific product class failures outside of our baseline experience we also record a warranty liability for specific matters we assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities quarterly and adjust amounts as necessary 

income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities applying enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences will reverse based on the evaluation of available evidence we recognize future tax benefits such as net operating loss carryforwards to the extent that we believe it is more likely than not we will realize these benefits we periodically assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 

and reflect any changes to our estimate of the amount we are more likely than not to realize in the valuation allowance with a corresponding adjustment to earnings or other comprehensive income as appropriate 

in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we look to the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences taxable income in carryback years and the feasibility of tax planning strategies and estimated future taxable income the valuation allowance can be affected by changes to tax laws changes to statutory tax rates and changes to future taxable income estimates 

our effective tax rate reflects the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which we have not provided us taxes because we plan to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside the united states we plan foreign earnings remittance amounts based on projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and longterm investment requirements of our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic operations based on these assumptions we estimate the amount we will distribute to the united states and provide the us federal taxes due on these amounts material changes in our estimates of cash working capital and longterm investment requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we do business could impact our effective tax rate 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and to the extent to which additional taxes will be due furthermore we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

we adjust our liability for uncertain tax positions in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional tax expense would result if a payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 

goodwill and intangible assets  we review goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable we also review the carrying value of our finitelived intangible assets for potential impairment when impairment indicators arise we conduct our annual impairment test as of the first day of the fourth quarter we perform a twostep impairment test for goodwill in the first step we compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds its fair value then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to measure the impairment loss to be recorded if any if the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value then we record an impairment loss equal to the difference in our annual impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets we compare the fair value of those assets to their carrying value we recognize an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying value we estimate the fair value of our reporting units and intangible assets with indefinite lives using an income approach under the income approach we calculate fair value based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinitelived intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions particularly related to future operating results and cash flows these estimates and assumptions include but are not limited to revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates assumed royalty rates future economic and market conditions and identification of appropriate market comparable data in addition the identification of reporting units and the allocation of assets and liabilities to the reporting units when determining the carrying value of each reporting unit also require judgment goodwill is tested for impairment at either the operating segment identified in note 21  “segment and geographic data” of the consolidated financial statements or one level below the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets is based on estimates and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable significant changes to these estimates and assumptions could adversely impact our conclusions actual future results may differ from those estimates 

during the fourth quarter of 2014  we performed our annual impairment assessment and determined that the estimated fair values of our goodwill reporting units were substantially in excess of each of their carrying values however future goodwill impairment tests could result in a charge to earnings we will continue to evaluate goodwill on an annual basis as of the beginning of our fourth quarter and whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate there may be a potential impairment 

we determined that no impairment of the indefinitelived intangibles existed as of the measurement date in 2014 during the fourth quarter of 2013 we performed our annual impairment test of our indefinitelived intangibles assets which resulted in an impairment charge of 2 million related to trade names within our water infrastructure segment refer to note 11  “goodwill and other intangible assets” for additional information 

postretirement plans company employees around the world participate in numerous defined benefit plans the determination of projected benefit obligations and the recognition of expenses related to these plans are dependent on various assumptions these major assumptions primarily relate to discount rates expected longterm rates of return on plan assets rate of future compensation increases mortality health care inflation and years of service some of which are disclosed in note 15  “postretirement benefit plans” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and other factors actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized on a straightline basis only to the extent they exceed 10 of the higher of the marketrelated value or projected benefit obligation over the average remaining service period of active plan participants or for plans with all or substantially all inactive participants over the average remaining life expectancy 

significant assumptions 

management develops each assumption using relevant company experience in conjunction with marketrelated data for each individual country in which such plans exist all assumptions are reviewed annually with thirdparty consultants and adjusted as necessary the table included below provides the weighted average assumptions used to estimate our defined benefit pension obligations and costs as of and for the years ended 2014  and 2013  



 we determine the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets by evaluating both historical returns and estimates of future returns specifically the company analyzes the estimated future returns based on independent estimates of asset class returns and evaluates historical broad market returns over longterm timeframes based on the strategic asset allocation which is detailed in note 15  “postretirement benefit plans” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

based on the approach described above the chart below shows weighted average actual returns versus the weighted average expected longterm rates of return for our pension plans that were utilized in the calculation of the net periodic pension cost for each respective year 



for the recognition of net periodic pension cost the calculation of the expected return on plan assets is generally derived by applying the expected longterm rate of return to the marketrelated value of plan assets the market 

related value of plan assets is based on average asset values at the measurement date over the last five years the use of fair value rather than a calculated value could materially affect net periodic pension cost our weighted average expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for all pension plans effective january 1 2015  is 738  we estimate that every 25 basis point change in the expected return on plan assets impacts the expense by 1 million 

the discount rate reflects our expectation of the present value of expected future cash payments for benefits at the measurement date a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense we base the discount rate assumption on current investment yields of highquality fixed income investments during the retirement benefits maturity period the pension discount rate was determined by considering an interest rate yield curve comprising aaaaa bonds with maturities between zero and 30 years developed by the plan’s actuaries annual benefit payments are then discounted to present value using this yield curve to develop a singlepoint discount rate matching the plan’s characteristics our weighted average discount rate for all pension plans effective january 1 2015  is 323  we estimate that every 25 basis point change in the discount rate impacts the expense by 1 million 

the rate of future compensation increase assumption reflects our longterm actual experience and future and nearterm outlook effective january 1 2015  our expected rate of future compensation is 334 for all pension plans the estimated impact of a 25 basis point change in the expected rate of future compensation is less than 1 million 

the assumed rate of future increases in the per capita cost of health care the health care trend rate is 688  for 2015  decreasing ratably to 500 in 2020 an increase or decrease in the health care trend rates by one percent per year would impact the aggregate annual service and interest components by less than 1 million and impact the benefit obligation by approximately 4 million 

we currently anticipate making contributions to our pension and postretirement benefit plans in the range of 24 million  to 34 million  during 2015  of which 7 million  is expected to be made in the first quarter 

funded status 

funded status is derived by subtracting the respective yearend values of the projected benefit obligations from the fair value of plan assets we estimate that every 25 basis point change in the discount rate impacts the funded status by approximately 30 million 

fair value of plan assets 

the plan assets of our pension plans comprise a broad range of investments including domestic and foreign equity securities interests in private equity and hedge funds fixed income investments insurance contracts and cash and cash equivalents 

a portion of our pension benefit plan assets portfolio comprises investments in private equity and hedge funds the private equity and hedge fund investments are generally measured at net asset value however in certain instances the values reported by the asset managers were not current at the measurement date accordingly we made estimate adjustments to the last reported value where necessary to measure the assets at fair value at the measurement date these adjustments consider information received from the asset managers as well as general market information the adjustment recorded at december 31 2014  and 2013  for these assets represented less than one percent of total plan assets in each respective year asset values for other positions were generally measured using market observable prices we estimate that a 5 change in asset values will impact funded status by approximately 27 million

 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign currency exchange and interest rates these exposures are actively monitored by management our exposure to foreign exchange rate risk is due to certain costs revenue and borrowings being denominated in currencies other than one of our subsidiaries functional currency similarly we are exposed to market risk as the result of changes in interest rates which may affect the cost of our financing it is our policy and practice to use derivative financial instruments only to the extent necessary to manage exposures 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we conduct approximately 62  of our business in various locations outside the united states 

our economic foreign currency risk primarily relates to receipts from customers payments to suppliers and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies we may use derivative financial instruments to offset risk related to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers when it is believed that the exposure will not be limited by our normal operating and financing activities in january 2012 we began to enter into currency forward contracts periodically in order to manage the exchange rate fluctuation risk on certain intercompany transactions associated with third party sales and purchases these risks are also mitigated by natural hedges including the presence of manufacturing facilities outside the united states global sourcing and other spending which occurs in foreign countries our principal foreign currency transaction exposures primarily relate to the euro swedish krona british pound canadian dollar polish zloty australian dollar and hungarian forint we estimate that a hypothetical 10 movement in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material economic impact to xylem’s financial position and results of operations 

additionally we are subject to foreign exchange translation risk due to changes in the value of foreign currencies in relation to our reporting currency the us dollar the translation risk is primarily concentrated in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro british pound chinese yuan swedish krona and canadian dollar as the us dollar strengthens against other currencies in which we transact business revenue and income will generally be negatively impacted and if the us dollar weakens revenue and income will generally be positively impacted we estimate that a hypothetical 10 movement of the us dollar to the various foreign currency exchange rates we translate from in the aggregate could have approximately a 7 impact on xylems consolidated revenue and income as reported in us dollars we expect to continue to generate significant revenue from nonus operations and we expect our cash will be predominately held by our foreign subsidiaries we expect to manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed we may transfer cash from certain international subsidiaries to the us and other international subsidiaries when it is cost effective to do so though our intent is to indefinitely reinvest most of these funds outside of the us as such we do not expect translation risk to have a material economic impact on our financial position and results of operations 

interest rate risk 

as of december 31 2014  we do not have a material exposure to interest rate risk as our debt portfolio primarily comprises longterm fixedrate instruments we do not account for our longterm debt using the fair value option 

commodity price exposures 

portions of our business are exposed to volatility in the prices of certain commodities such as copper nickel and aluminum among others our primary exposure to this volatility resides with the use of these materials in purchased component parts we generally maintain longterm fixed price contracts on raw materials and component parts however we are prone to exposure as these contracts expire we estimate that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in prices for raw metal commodities would not be material to our financial position and results of operations

we initiated an organizational redesign during the fourth quarter of 2013 shifting from individually managed businesses to an integrated approach within geographical regions we expect that this will enable us to leverage the breadth of the company’s product and services portfolio to better serve our customers and address market opportunities as well as effectively utilize internal support organizations to realize economies of scale and efficient use of resources this organizational redesign has implications on how we will manage the business and the 

related measurement system by which we will hold our management team accountable we are in the process of changing our measurement system including our underlying accounting system which we expect to complete by the middle of 2014 

our industry 

our planet faces a serious water challenge less than 1 of the total water available on earth is fresh water and this percentage is declining due to factors such as the draining of aquifers increased pollution and climate change in addition demand for fresh water is rising rapidly due to population growth industrial expansion and increased agricultural development with consumption estimated to double every 20 years by 2025 more than 30 of the world’s population is expected to live in areas without adequate water supply even in developed countries with sufficient supply existing infrastructure for water supply is relatively underfunded and aging in the united states degrading pipe systems leak one out of every six gallons of water on average on its way from a treatment plant to the customer these challenges are driving opportunities for growth in the global water industry which we estimate to have a total market size of approximately 550 billion  

the water industry supply chain is comprised of equipment and services companies design and build service providers and water utilities equipment and service providers serve distinct customer types the utilities type supply water through an infrastructure network companies that operate on this side of the supply chain provide single or sometimes combined functions from equipment manufacturing and services to facility design engineering procurement and construction or “epc” firms to plant operations utilities as depicted below in figure 1 the utility and epc customers are looking for technology and application expertise from their equipment and services providers due to trends such as rising pollution stricter regulations and the increased outsourcing of process knowledge the customer type serves the end users of water and comprises a wide array of entities including farms mines power plants industrial facilities and residential homes these customers are predominately served through specialized distributors and original equipment manufacturers “oems” 

figure 1 water industry supply chain 

our business focuses on the beginning of the supply chain by providing technologyintensive equipment and services we sell our equipment and services via direct and indirect channels that serve the needs of each customer type on the utility side we provide the majority of our sales direct to customers with strong application expertise with the remaining amount going through distribution partners to end users of water we provide the majority of our sales through longstanding relationships with the world’s leading distributors with the remainder going direct to customers 

the equipment and services market addresses the key processes of the water industry which are best illustrated through the cycle of water as depicted in figure 2 below we believe this industry has two distinct sectors within the cycle of water water infrastructure and usage applications the key processes of this cycle begin when raw water is extracted by pumps which provide the necessary pressure and flow to move or transport this water from natural sources such as oceans ground water lakes and rivers through pipes to treatment facilities treatment facilities can provide many forms of treatment such as filtration disinfection and desalination to remove solids bacteria and salt respectively throughout each of these stages analytical instruments test the treated water to ensure regulatory requirements are met so that it can be utilized by enduse customers a network of pipes and pumps again transports this clean water to where it is needed such as to crops for irrigation to power plants to provide cooling in industrial water or to an apartment building as drinking water in residential and commercial buildings after usage the wastewater is collected by a separate network of pipes and pumps and transported to a wastewater treatment facility where processes such as digestion deactivate and reduce the volume of solids and disinfection purifies effluent water once treated analytical instruments test the treated water to ensure regulatory requirements are met so that it can be discharged back to the environment thereby completing the cycle 

figure 2 cycle of water 

in the water infrastructure sector two primary end markets exist public utility and industrial the public utility market comprises public private and publicprivate institutions that handle water and wastewater for mostly residential and commercial purposes the industrial market involves the supply of water and removal of wastewater for industrial facilities we view the main macro drivers of this sector to be water quality the desire for energyefficient products water scarcity regulatory requirements and infrastructure needs for both the repair of aging systems in developed countries as well as new installations in emerging markets 

in the usage applications sector enduse customers fall into four main markets residential commercial industrial and agricultural homeowners represent the end users in the residential market owners and managers of properties such as apartment buildings retail stores restaurants hospitals and hotels are examples of end users in the commercial market the industrial market is wide ranging involving developers and managers of facilities operated by electrical power generators chemical manufacturers machine shops clothing manufacturers beverage production and dispensing firms and car washes the agricultural market end users are owners and operators of businesses such as crop and livestock farms aquaculture golf courses and other turf applications we believe population growth urbanization and regulatory requirements are the primary macro drivers of these markets as these trends drive the need for housing food community services and retail goods within growing city centers water reuse and conservation are driving the need for new technologies 

business strategy 

our strategy is to enhance shareholder value by providing distinctive solutions for our customers most important water challenges enabling us to grow revenue organically and through strategic acquisitions as we streamline our cost structure key elements of our strategy are summarized below 

 business segments 

we operate in two business segments that are aligned with the cycle of water and the key strategic market applications they provide water infrastructure collection distribution return and applied water usage see note 21  “industry segment and geographic data” in our consolidated and combined financial statements for financial information about segments and geographic areas

distribution training and end use 

water infrastructure provides the majority of its sales through direct channels with remaining sales through indirect channels and service capabilities both public utility and industrial facility customers increasingly require our teams’ global but locally proficient expertise to use our equipment in their specific applications several trends are increasing the need for this application expertise i the increase in type and amount of contaminants in water supply ii increasing environmental regulations iii the need to increase system efficiencies due to rising energy costs and iv the retirement of a largely aging water industry workforce not systematically replaced at utilities 

in the applied water segment many enduse areas are widely different so specialized distribution partners are often preferred our commercial teams have built longstanding relationships around our brands in many of these industries through which we can continue to leverage new product and service applications revenue opportunities are balanced between oem and aftermarket customers our products in the applied water segment are sold through our global direct sales and strong indirect channels with the majority of revenue going through indirect channels we have longstanding relationships with the leading independent distributors in the markets we serve and we provide incentives to distributors such as specialized training programs to sell our products exclusively 

aftermarket parts and service 

we have many service centers around the world which employ service employees to provide aftermarket parts and services to our customers during their lifecycle installed products require maintenance repair services and parts due to the harsh environments in which they operate 

in addition depending on the type of product median lifecycles range from 5 years to over 50 years at which time they must be replaced many of our products are precisely selected and applied within a larger network of equipment driving a strong preference by customers and installers to replace them with the same exact brand and model when they reach the end of their lifecycle this dynamic establishes a large recurring revenue stream for our business 

supply and seasonality 

we have a global manufacturing footprint with production facilities in europe north america latin america and asia in addition we maintain a global network of service centers providing aftermarket customer care service centers offer an array of integrated service solutions for the industry including preventive monitoring contract maintenance emergency field service engineered upgrades inventory management and overhauls for pumps and other rotating equipment 

we offer a wide range of highly engineered products we primarily employ configuretoorder capabilities to maximize manufacturing and logistics efficiencies by producing high volumes of basic product configurations when we provide a configuretoorder solution we configure a standard product to our customers’ specifications to a lesser extent we provide engineertoorder products to meet the customization requirements of our customers this process requires that we apply our technical expertise and production capabilities to provide a nonstandard solution to the customer 

our inventory management and distribution practices seek to minimize inventory holding periods by taking delivery of the inventory and manufacturing immediately prior to the sale or distribution of products to our customers all of our businesses require various parts and raw materials of which the availability and prices may fluctuate parts and raw materials commonly used in our products include motors fabricated parts castings bearings seals nickel copper aluminum and plastics while we may recover some cost increases through operational improvements we are still exposed to some pricing risk we attempt to control costs through fixedpriced contracts with suppliers and various other programs such as our global strategic sourcing initiative 

our business relies on thirdparty suppliers contract manufacturing and commodity markets to secure raw materials parts and components used in our products we typically acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our materials requirements for most of our products we have existing alternate sources of supply or such sources are readily available 

we may experience price volatility or supply constraints for materials that are not available from multiple sources from time to time we acquire certain inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longerterm pricing commitments with vendors to improve the priority price and availability of supply there have been no raw material shortages that have had a significant adverse impact on our business as a whole 

our water infrastructure and applied water segments experience some modest level of seasonality in its business this seasonality is dependent on factors such as capital spending of customers as well as weather conditions including heavy flooding droughts and fluctuations in temperatures which can positively or negatively impact portions of our business 

customers 

our business is not dependent on any single customer or a few customers the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on the applicable market or on the company as a whole no individual customer accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated 2013  2012  or 2011  revenue 

backlog 

delivery schedules vary from customer to customer based upon their requirements typically large projects require longer lead production cycles and delays can occur from time to time total backlog was 707 million  at 

december 31 2013  and 647 million  at december 31 2012  we anticipate that more than 90 of the backlog at december 31 2013  will be recognized as revenue during 2014  

competition 

given the highly fragmented nature of the water industry water infrastructure competes with a large number of businesses competition in the water transport and treatment technologies markets focuses on product performance application expertise design quality delivery and price in the sale of products and services we benefit from our large installed base of pumps and complementary products which require maintenance repair and replacement parts due to the nature of the products and the conditions under which they operate timeliness of delivery quality and the proximity of service centers are important customer considerations when selecting a provider for aftermarket products and services as well as equipment rentals in geographic regions where we are locally positioned to provide a quick response customers have historically relied on us rather than our competitors for aftermarket products relating to our highly engineered and customized solutions our key competitors within the water infrastructure segment include ksb inc sulzer ltd evoqua water technologies formerly siemans ag and danaher corporation 

competition in the applied water segment focuses on brand names application expertise product delivery and performance quality and price we compete by offering a wide variety of innovative and highquality products coupled with worldclass application expertise we believe our distribution through wellestablished channels and our reputation for quality significantly enhance our market position our ability to deliver innovative product offerings has allowed us to compete effectively to cultivate and maintain customer relationships and to serve and expand into many niche and new markets our key competitors within the applied water segment include grundfos wilo se pentair ltd and franklin electric co inc 

research and development 

research and development “rd” is a key element of our engineering culture and is generally focused on the design and development of products and application knowhow that anticipate customer needs and emerging trends our engineers are involved in new product development and improvement of existing products our businesses invest substantial resources for rd we anticipate we will continue to develop and invest in our rd capabilities to promote a steady flow of innovative highquality and reliable products and applications to further strengthen our position in the markets we serve we invested 104 million  106 million  and 100 million  for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively towards rd 

we have engineering and research employees in technology centers around the world rd activities are initially conducted in our technology centers located in conjunction with some of our major manufacturing facilities to ensure an efficient development process we have a wastewater center of excellence in stockholm sweden with research development and engineering employees we have centers of excellence in india and china where we are accelerating the customization of our application expertise to local needs in the scaleup process our rd activities are conducted at our piloting and testing facilities or at strategic customer sites these piloting and testing facilities enable us to serve our strategic markets in each region of the world 

we generally seek patent protection for those inventions and improvements that we believe will improve our competitive position we believe that our patents and applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and improving our return on research and development investments while we own control or license a significant number of patents trade secrets proprietary information trademarks trade names copyrights and other intellectual property rights which in the aggregate are of material importance to our business management believes that our business as a whole as well as each of our core business segments is not materially dependent on any one intellectual property right or related group of such rights 

patents patent applications and license agreements expire or terminate over time by operation of law in accordance with their terms or otherwise as the portfolio of our patents patent applications and license agreements has evolved over time we do not expect the expiration of any specific patent to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

environmental matters and regulation 

our manufacturing operations worldwide are subject to many requirements under environmental laws in the united states the environmental protection agency and similar state agencies administer laws and regulations concerning air emissions water discharges waste disposal environmental remediation and other aspects of environmental protection such environmental laws and regulations in the united states include for example the federal clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act environmental requirements significantly affect our operations we have established an internal program to address compliance with applicable environmental requirements and as a result management believes that we are in substantial compliance with current environmental regulations 

while environmental laws and regulations are subject to change such changes can be difficult to predict reliably and the timing of potential changes is uncertain management does not believe based on current circumstances that compliance costs pursuant to such regulations will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations however the effect of future legislative or regulatory changes could be material to our financial condition or results of operations 

accruals for environmental matters are recorded on a sitebysite basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on current law and existing technologies it can be difficult to estimate reliably the final costs of investigation and remediation due to various factors our accrued liabilities for these environmental matters represent the best estimates related to the investigation and remediation of environmental media such as water soil soil vapor air and structures as well as related legal fees based upon the facts and circumstances as currently known to us these estimates and related accruals are reviewed quarterly and updated for progress of investigation and remediation efforts and changes in facts and legal circumstances liabilities for these environmental expenditures are recorded on an undiscounted basis we do not anticipate these liabilities will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated and combined financial position or results of operations we cannot make assurances that other sites or new details about sites known to us that could give rise to environmental liabilities with such material adverse effects on us will not be identified in the future at december 31 2013  we had estimated and accrued 8 million  related to environmental matters 

employees 

as of december 31 2013  xylem had more than 12500 employees worldwide we have over 3700 employees in the united states of whom approximately 17 are represented by labor unions and in certain foreign countries some of our employees are represented by work councils we believe that our facilities are in favorable labor markets with ready access to adequate numbers of workers and believe our relations with our employees are good

 item 1a risk factors 

in evaluating our business each of the following risks should be carefully considered along with all of the other information in this report and in our other filings with the sec should any of these risks and uncertainties develop into actual events our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

risks related to operational and external factors 

failure to compete successfully in our markets could adversely affect our business 

we provide products and services into competitive markets we believe the principal points of competition in our markets are product performance reliability and innovation application expertise brand reputation energy efficiency product life cycle cost timeliness of delivery proximity of service centers effectiveness of our distribution channels and price maintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment by us in manufacturing research and development engineering marketing customer service and support and our distribution networks we may not be successful in maintaining our competitive position our competitors may develop products that are superior to our products or may develop more efficient or effective methods of providing products and services or may adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies or evolving customer requirements pricing pressures also could cause us to adjust the prices of certain products to stay competitive we may not be able to compete successfully with our existing or new competitors failure to continue competing successfully or to win large contracts could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by global economic and financial market conditions 

we compete around the world in various geographic and product markets in 2013  38  and 36  of our total revenue was from customers located in the united states and europe respectively we expect revenue from these markets to be significant for the foreseeable future important factors impacting our businesses include the overall strength of these economies and our customers’ confidence in both local and global macroeconomic conditions industrial and federal state local and municipal governmental spending the strength of the residential and commercial real estate markets interest rates availability of commercial financing for our customers and endusers and unemployment rates a slowdown or downturn in these financial or macroeconomic conditions could have a significant adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

economic and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our business 

in 2013  62  of our total revenue was from customers outside the united states we expect our international operations and export sales to continue to be a significant portion of our revenue both our sales from international operations and export sales are subject in varying degrees to risks inherent to doing business outside the united states these risks include the following 

 any payment of distributions loans or advances to us by our foreign subsidiaries could be subject to restrictions on or taxation of dividends on repatriation of earnings under applicable local law monetary transfer restrictions and foreign currency exchange regulations in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate in addition to the general risks that we face outside the united states we now conduct more of our operations in emerging markets than we have in the past which could involve additional uncertainties for us including risks that governments may impose limitations on our ability to repatriate funds governments may impose withholding or other taxes on remittances and other payments to us or the amount of any such taxes may increase an outbreak or escalation of 

any insurrection or armed conflict may occur governments may seek to nationalize our assets or governments may impose or increase investment barriers or other restrictions affecting our business in addition emerging markets pose other uncertainties including the protection of our intellectual property and other assets pressure on the pricing of our products higher business conduct risks less qualified talent and risks of political instability we cannot predict the impact such future largely unforeseeable events might have on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business could be adversely affected by the inability of suppliers to meet delivery requirements 

our business relies on thirdparty suppliers contract manufacturing and commodity markets to secure raw materials parts and components used in our products parts and raw materials commonly used in our products include motors fabricated parts castings bearings seals nickel copper aluminum and plastics we are exposed to the availability of these materials which may be subject to curtailment or change due to among other things interruptions in production by suppliers labor disputes the impaired financial condition of a particular supplier suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels ability to meet regulatory requirements weather emergencies or acts of war or terrorism any delay in our suppliers’ abilities to provide us with necessary materials could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers and accordingly could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our business could be adversely affected by significant movements in foreign currency exchange rates 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly with respect to the euro swedish krona british pound australian dollar canadian dollar polish zloty and hungarian forint any significant change in the value of currencies of the countries in which we do business relative to the value of the us dollar or euro could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

weather conditions may adversely affect our financial results 

weather conditions including heavy flooding droughts and fluctuations in temperatures can positively or negatively impact portions of our business within the dewatering space our pumps provided through our godwin brand are used to remove excess or unwanted water heavy flooding due to weather conditions drives increased demand for these applications on the other hand drought conditions drive higher demand for pumps used in agricultural and turf irrigation applications such as those provided by our goulds water technology flowtronex and lowara brands fluctuations to warmer and cooler temperatures result in varying levels of demand for products used in residential and commercial applications where homes and buildings are heated and cooled with hvac units such as those provided by our bg brand given the unpredictable nature of weather conditions this may result in volatility for certain portions of our business as well as the operations of certain of our customers and suppliers 

our financial results can be difficult to predict 

our business is impacted by an increasing amount of short cycle and book and bill business which we have limited insight into particularly for the business that we transact through our distributors we are also impacted by large projects whose timing can change based upon customer requirements due to a number of factors affecting the project such as funding readiness of the project and regulatory approvals accordingly our financial results for any given period can be difficult to predict 

our strategy includes acquisitions and we may not be able to make acquisitions of suitable candidates or integrate acquisitions successfully 

our historical growth has included acquisitions as part of our growth strategy we plan to pursue the acquisition of other companies assets and product lines that either complement or expand our existing business we cannot make assurances however that we will be able to identify suitable candidates successfully negotiate appropriate acquisition terms obtain financing that may be needed to consummate those acquisitions complete proposed acquisitions successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or expand into new markets in addition we cannot make assurances that any acquisition once successfully integrated will perform as planned be accretive to earnings or prove to be beneficial to our operations or cash flow 

acquisitions involve a number of risks and present financial managerial and operational challenges including diversion of management attention from existing businesses and operations integration of technology operations personnel and financial and other systems potentially insufficient internal controls over financial activities or 

financial reporting at an acquired entity that could impact us on a combined basis the failure to realize expected synergies the possibility that we have acquired substantial undisclosed liabilities and the loss of key employees of the acquired businesses 

we may incur impairment charges for our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets which would negatively impact our operating results 

we have a significant amount of goodwill and purchased intangible assets on our balance sheet as a result of acquisitions we have completed as of december 31 2013 the net carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets totaled approximately 2 billion the carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of an acquired business in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date the carrying value of indefinitelived intangible assets represents the fair value of trademarks and trade names as of the acquisition date we do not amortize goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets that we expect to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows but instead we evaluate these assets for impairment at least annually or more frequently if interim indicators suggest that a potential impairment could exist in testing for impairment we will make a qualitative assessment and if we believe that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the quantitative twostep goodwill impairment test is required significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets divestitures and market capitalization declines may impair our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets any charges relating to such impairments could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in the periods recognized 

our ability to successfully execute our organizational redesign as well as other restructuring and realignment actions could impact our business results 

we initiated an organizational redesign during the fourth quarter of 2013 shifting from individually managed businesses to an integrated approach within geographical regions we expect that this will enable us to leverage the breadth of the company’s product and services portfolio to better serve our customers and address market opportunities as well as effectively utilize internal support organizations to realize economies of scale and efficient use of resources the successful implementation and execution of this redesign which is still in the process of being implemented as well as our other restructuring and realignment actions is critical to achieving our expected cost savings as well as effectively competing in the marketplace other factors that may impede a successful implementation is retention of key employees the impact of regulatory matters and adverse economic market conditions if the organizational redesign or restructuring and realignment actions are not executed successfully the company’s financial results could be adversely impacted 

changes in our effective tax rates may adversely affect our financial results 

we sell our products in more than 150 countries and 62  of our revenue was generated outside the united states in 2013  given the global nature of our business a number of factors may increase our future effective tax rates including 

 any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could reduce net income for future periods 

our business could be adversely affected by inflation and other manufacturing and operating cost increases 

our operating costs are subject to fluctuations particularly due to changes in commodity prices raw materials energy and related utilities freight and cost of labor in order to remain competitive we may not be able to recuperate all or a portion of these higher costs from our customers through product price increases further our 

ability to realize financial benefits from six sigma and lean projects may not be able to mitigate fully or in part these manufacturing and operating cost increases and as a result could negatively impact our profitability 

product defects and unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure with respect to our products could adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements 

manufacturing or design defects in including in products or components that we source from third parties unanticipated use of or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of products that we make or sell can lead to personal injury death or property damage these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products result in the removal of a product from the market and result in product liability claims being brought against us although we have liability insurance we cannot be certain that this insurance coverage will continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost or will be adequate to cover any product liability claims recalls removals and product liability claims can result in significant costs as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products 

our indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operational flexibility 

as of december 31 2013  our total outstanding indebtedness was 1241 million  including our 355 senior notes of 600 million aggregate principal amount due september 2016 and 4875 senior notes of 600 million aggregate principal amount due october 2021 we have an existing four year competitive advance and revolving credit facility the “credit facility” which provides for an aggregate principal amount of up to 600 million we have a risk sharing finance facility agreement the rd facility agreement with the european investment bank eib in an aggregate principal amount of up to €120 million  approximately 165 million  

our indebtedness could 

 in addition there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available to us on favorable terms or at all for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness if we incur additional debt or raise equity through the issuance of preferred stock the terms of the debt or preferred stock issued may give the holders rights preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock particularly in the event of liquidation the terms of the debt may also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on our operations than we currently have also regardless of the terms of our debt or equity financing the amount of our stock that we can issue may be limited because the issuance of our stock may cause the distribution to be a taxable event for itt under section 355e of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” and under the tax matters agreement entered into by itt in connection with the spinoff the “tax matters agreement” we could be required to indemnify itt for that tax 

our ability to make scheduled principal payments of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance which may be affected by factors beyond our control if we are unable to service our indebtedness our business financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 

failure to comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act or other applicable anticorruption legislation could result in fines criminal penalties and an adverse effect on our business 

we operate in a number of countries throughout the world including countries considered to have a high risk of corruption we are committed to doing business in accordance with applicable anticorruption laws we are subject 

however to the risk that we or our affiliated entities or our representatives or their respective officers directors employees and agents may take action determined to be in violation of such anticorruption laws or regulations including the us foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 the uk bribery act of 2010 and others any such violation could result in substantial fines sanctions civil andor criminal penalties and curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions and might adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition in addition actual or alleged violations could damage our reputation and ability to do business furthermore detecting investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations is expensive and can consume significant time and attention of our senior management 

we may be negatively impacted by litigation and regulatory proceedings 

we are subject to laws regulations and potential liability relating to claims complaints and proceedings including those related to antitrust environmental product and other matters 

we are subject to various laws ordinances regulations and other requirements of government authorities in foreign countries and in the united states any violation of which could potentially create substantial liability for us and also damage to our reputation changes in laws ordinances regulations or other government policies the nature timing and effect of which are uncertain may significantly increase our expenses and liabilities 

from time to time we are involved in legal proceedings that are incidental to the operation of our businesses including acquisitions and divestitures some of these proceedings seek remedies relating to environmental matters intellectual property matters product liability and personal injury claims employment labor and pension matters and government and commercial or contract issues sometimes related to acquisitions or divestitures we may become subject to significant claims of which we are currently unaware or the claims of which we are aware may result in our incurring a significantly greater liability than we anticipate or can estimate additionally we may receive fines or penalties or be required to change or cease operations at one or more facilities if a regulatory agency determines that we have failed to comply with laws regulations or orders applicable to our business 

our business could be adversely affected by interruptions in information technology communications networks and operations 

our business operations rely on information technology and communications networks and operations that are vulnerable to damage or disturbance from a variety of sources regardless of protection measures essentially all systems are susceptible to disruption due to failure vandalism computer viruses security breaches natural disasters power outages and other events in addition cybersecurity threats are evolving and include among others malicious software attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in our systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data we also have a concentration of operations on certain sites eg production and shared services centers where business interruptions could cause material damage and costs transport of goods from suppliers and to customers could also be hampered for the reasons stated above although we continue to assess these risks implement controls and perform business continuity planning we cannot be sure that interruptions with material adverse effects will not occur 

failure to retain our existing senior management engineering sales and other key personnel or the inability to attract and retain new qualified personnel could negatively impact our ability to operate or grow our business 

our success will continue to depend to a significant extent on our ability to retain or attract a significant number of employees in senior management engineering sales and other key personnel the ability to attract or retain employees will depend on our ability to offer competitive compensation training and cultural benefits we will need to continue to develop a roster of qualified talent to support business growth and replace departing employees effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution a failure to retain or attract highly skilled personnel could adversely affect our operating results or ability to operate or grow our business 

if we do not or cannot adequately protect our intellectual property if third parties infringe our intellectual property rights or if third parties claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights we may suffer competitive injury expend significant resources enforcing our rights or defending against such claims or be prevented from selling products or services 

we own numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others which in aggregate are important to our business the intellectual property rights that we obtain however may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage because they may not be sufficiently broad or may be challenged invalidated circumvented independently developed or designedaround particularly in countries where intellectual property rights laws are not highly developed or protected our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we receive notices from third parties alleging intellectual property infringement or misappropriation any dispute or litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation in addition as a result of such claims of infringement or misappropriation we could lose our rights   to critical technology be unable to license critical technology or sell critical products and services be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights or be required to redesign our products at substantial cost any of which could adversely impact our competitive position and financial statements even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation we may incur significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we cannot make assurances that we will pay dividends on our common stock or continue to repurchase our common stock under board approved share repurchase plans and likewise our indebtedness could limit our ability to pay dividends or make share repurchases 

the timing declaration amount and payment of future dividends to our shareholders fall within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on many factors including our financial condition results of operations and capital requirements as well as applicable law regulatory constraints industry practice and other business considerations that our board of directors considers relevant there can be no assurance that we will pay a dividend in the future or continue to pay dividends 

further the timing and amount of the repurchase of our common stock under board approved share repurchase plans has similar dependencies as the payment of dividends and accordingly there can be no assurances that we will continue to repurchase our common stock 

additionally if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our debtpayment obligations then our ability to pay dividends if so determined by the board of directors or make share repurchases will be impaired and we may be required to attempt to restructure or refinance our debt raise additional capital or take other actions such as selling assets reducing or delaying capital expenditures reducing our dividend or delaying or curtailing share repurchases there can be no assurance however that any such actions could be effected on satisfactory terms if at all or would be permitted by the terms of our debt or our other credit and contractual arrangements 

the level of returns on postretirement benefit plan assets changes in interest rates and other factors could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods 

certain members of our current and retired employee population are covered by pension and other employeerelated defined benefit plans collectively postretirement benefit plans we may experience significant fluctuations in costs related to our postretirement benefit plans as a result of macroeconomic factors such as interest rates that are beyond our control the cost of our postretirement plans is incurred over long periods of time and involves factors and uncertainties during those periods which can be volatile and unpredictable including rates of return on postretirement benefit plan assets discount rates used to calculate liabilities and expenses and rates of future compensation increases management develops each assumption using relevant plan and company experience and expectations in conjunction with marketrelated data our liquidity financial position including shareholders’ 

equity and results of operations could be materially affected by significant changes in key economic indicators actuarial experience financial market volatility future legislation and other governmental regulatory actions 

we make contributions to fund our postretirement benefit plans when considered necessary or advantageous to do so the macroeconomic factors discussed above including the return on postretirement benefit plan assets and the minimum funding requirements established by local government funding or taxing authorities or established by other agreement may influence future funding requirements a significant decline in the fair value of our plan assets or other adverse changes to our overall pension and other employeerelated benefit plans could require us to make significant funding contributions and affect cash flows in future periods 

unforeseen environmental issues could impact our financial position or results of operations 

our operations are subject to and affected by many federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations in addition we could be affected by future environmental laws or regulations including for example those imposed in response to climate change concerns compliance with current and future environmental laws and regulations currently requires and is expected to continue to require operating and capital expenditures 

environmental laws and regulations may authorize substantial fines and criminal sanctions as well as facility shutdowns to address violations and may require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit emissions or discharges we also incur and expect to continue to incur costs to comply with current environmental laws and regulations 

developments such as the adoption of new environmental laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations violations by us of such laws and regulations discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination litigation involving environmental impacts our inability to recover costs associated with any such developments or financial insolvency of other responsible parties could in the future have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 

the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly 

we cannot predict the prices at which our common stock may trade the market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely depending on many factors some of which may be beyond our control including 

 23 

stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents and indiana law could delay or prevent a change in control 

certain provisions of our second amended and restated articles of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may delay or prevent a merger or acquisition part or all of our business operations for example the second amended and restated articles of incorporation and the amended and restated bylaws among other things require advance notice for shareholder proposals and nominations do not permit shareholders to convene special meetings and do not permit action by written consent of the shareholders unless unanimous in addition the amended and restated articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock these provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals of our business operations or delay or prevent a change in control which could harm our stock price indiana law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 10 or more of our outstanding common stock and us 

risks related to our 2011 separation from itt corporation 

if the spinoff were to fail to qualify as a taxfree transaction under the internal revenue code then we andor our former parent and our stockholders could be subject to significant tax liability 

in connection with the spinoff we and our former parent itt corporation received an irs ruling the “irs ruling” stating that itt and its shareholders will not recognize any taxable income gain or loss for us federal income tax purposes as a result of the spinoff in addition itt received an opinion of tax counsel as to the satisfaction of certain requirements necessary for the spinoff to receive taxfree treatment upon which the irs did not rule the irs ruling while generally binding upon the irs was based on certain factual statements and representations if any such factual statements or representations were incomplete or untrue in any material respect or if the facts on which the irs ruling were based were materially different from the facts at the time of the spinoff the irs could modify or revoke the irs ruling retroactively 

as discussed above certain requirements for taxfree treatment that are not covered in the irs ruling were addressed in the opinion of counsel the opinion of counsel is not binding on the irs accordingly the irs may reach conclusions with respect to the spinoff that are different from the conclusions reached in the opinion like the irs ruling the opinion was based on certain factual statements and representations which if incomplete or untrue in any material respect could alter counsel’s conclusions 

if all or a portion of the spinoff does not qualify as a taxfree transaction because any of the factual statements or representations in the irs ruling or the legal opinion are incomplete or untrue or because the facts upon which the irs ruling is based were materially different from the facts at the time of the spinoff itt would recognize a substantial gain for us federal income tax purposes in such case under us treasury regulations each member of the itt consolidated group at the time of the spinoff including us and our subsidiaries would be jointly and severally liable for the entire amount of any resulting us federal income tax liability 

notwithstanding the foregoing the spinoff will be taxable to itt but not to itt shareholders pursuant to section 355e of the internal revenue code if there are one or more acquisitions including issuances of the stock of either us or itt representing 50 or more measured by vote or value of the thenoutstanding stock of either corporation and the acquisition or acquisitions are deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the spinoff any acquisition of our common stock within two years before or after the spinoff with exceptions including public trading by lessthan5 shareholders and certain compensatory stock issuances generally will be presumed to be part of such a plan unless that presumption is rebutted the tax liability resulting from the application of section 355e would be substantial in addition under us treasury regulations each member of the itt consolidated group at the time of the spinoff including us and our subsidiaries would be severally liable for the resulting us federal income tax liability 

we have agreed not to enter into any transaction that could cause any portion of the spinoff to be taxable to itt including under section 355e pursuant to the tax matters agreement dated as of october 25 2011 among itt exelis and xylem we have also agreed to indemnify itt and exelis for any tax liabilities resulting from such transactions and itt and exelis have agreed to indemnify us for any tax liabilities resulting from such transactions 

entered into by itt or exelis these obligations may discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company 

the spinoff may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal distribution requirements 

the spinoff could be challenged under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws an unpaid creditor or an entity vested with the power of such creditor such as a trustee or debtorinpossession in a bankruptcy could claim that the spinoff left us itt andor exelis insolvent or with unreasonably small capital or that we itt andor exelis intended or believed it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay as they mature and that itt did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value in the spinoff if a court were to agree with such a plaintiff then such court could void the spinoff as a fraudulent transfer and could impose a number of different remedies which could adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations among other things the court could require the return of assets or our shares to itt voiding the liens of xylem and claims against itt or providing itt with a claim for money damages against us 

the measure of insolvency for purposes of the fraudulent conveyance laws will vary depending on which jurisdiction’s law is applied generally however an entity would be considered insolvent if either the fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount of its liabilities including the probable amount of contingent liabilities or it is unlikely to be able to pay its liabilities as they become due no assurance can be given as to what standard a court would apply to determine insolvency or that a court would determine that we itt or exelis were solvent at the time of or after giving effect to the spinoff 

the spinoff could also be challenged under state corporate distribution statutes under the indiana business corporation law a corporation may not make distributions to its shareholders if after giving effect to the distribution i the corporation would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business or ii the corporation’s total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities no assurance can be given that a court will not later determine that the distribution of our shares in connection with the spinoff was unlawful 

under the distribution agreement from and after the spinoff we will be responsible for the debts liabilities and other obligations related to the business or businesses which we own and operate following the consummation of the spinoff although we do not expect to be liable for any of these or other obligations not expressly assumed by us pursuant to the distribution agreement it is possible that we could be required to assume responsibility for certain obligations retained by itt or exelis should itt or exelis fail to pay or perform its retained obligations for example tax asbestos andor environmental liabilities 

in connection with our separation itt and exelis will indemnify us for certain liabilities and we will indemnify itt or exelis for certain liabilities if we are required to indemnify itt or exelis we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations and our financial results could be negatively impacted in the case of itt’s or exelis’s indemnity there can be no assurance that those indemnities will be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of such liabilities or as to itt’s or exelis’s ability to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future 

pursuant to the distribution agreement and certain other agreements with itt and exelis itt and exelis agreed to indemnify us from certain liabilities and we agreed to indemnify itt and exelis for certain liabilities indemnities that we may be required to provide itt and exelis may be significant and could negatively impact our business particularly indemnities relating to our actions that could impact the taxfree nature of the spinoff third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that itt or exelis has agreed to retain further there can be no assurance that the indemnities from itt and exelis will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities or that itt and exelis will be able to fully satisfy their indemnification obligations moreover even if we ultimately were to succeed in recovering from itt and exelis any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves each of these risks could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition

 executive summary 

xylem reported revenue for 2013  of 3837 million  an increase of 12  from 3791 million  reported in 2012  the 2012 and 2013 acquisitions within our water infrastructure segment contributed 82 million  of incremental revenue during 2013 or 22 continued challenging market conditions in europe drove a decrease in revenue while the united states and emerging markets held flat operating income for the year ended 2013  was 363 million  reflecting a decrease of 80 million  or 181  compared to 443 million  in 2012  which was primarily due to increased restructuring costs special charges in 2013 and geographic mix headwinds partially offset by the benefits achieved from cost reductions and higher price realization 

additional financial highlights for 2013  include the following 

 2014  business outlook 

in 2014 we are expecting some of the trends that we saw in the second half of 2013 to continue we expect a continued slow recovery in the united states industrial markets combined with modest improved performance in our european industrial end markets globally while our industrial markets are improving in production and capital outlay continued weak performance in mining is expected we expect public utilities to return to modest levels of growth in 2014 with growth driven by operations and maintenance spending partially offset by continued weakness in capital expenditure spending by our customers in general we expect a slow recovery in most of the developed country end markets and modestly higher levels of growth in emerging markets we are continuing to execute restructuring and realignment actions to reposition our european and north american business to optimize our cost structure and improve our operational efficiency and effectiveness during 2013 we incurred 40 million and 24 million in restructuring and realignment costs respectively as a result of the restructuring actions in 2013 we realized 13 million of net savings in 2014 we expect to incur approximately 30 to 35 million in restructuring costs and approximately 10 to 15 million in realignment costs we expect to realize 25 million of incremental net savings in 2014 from actions initiated in 2013 and an additional 10 million of net savings from our 2014 actions additional strategic actions we are taking include investing in a customer relationship management system growth platforms and new product development as well as executing operating efficiencies through lean six sigma and global sourcing initiatives we also will refocus on the xylem management system which integrates our key business processes

2013  versus 2012   

revenue 

revenue generated for 2013  was 3837 million  an increase of 46 million  or 12  compared to 3791 million  in 2012  on a constant currency basis revenue grew 11  the following table illustrates the impact from organic growth recent acquisitions and fluctuations in foreign currency in relation to revenue during 2013  



 35 

the following table summarizes revenue by segment for 2013  and 2012  

water infrastructure 

water infrastructure’s revenue increased 32 million  or 13  in 2013   15  on a constant currency basis our 2012 and 2013 acquisitions contributed 82 million  of incremental revenue in 2013 

organic revenue decreased 46 million  or 19  during the year which was substantially due to lower volumes across the transport treatment and test applications the significant declines were primarily caused by weakness in the europe middle east and africa treatment markets and declines in transport in the asia pacific markets from less mining activity organic revenue performance improved yearoveryear in the third and fourth quarters of 2013 driven by increases in transport revenue which reflected modest market recovery in northern and central europe as well as the united states treatment negatively impacted organic growth for the year as revenue decreased from 2012 substantially due to nonrecurring large custom projects shipped in the prior year as well as project delays from government funding uncertainties additionally test applications which had flat organic revenue in 2013 experienced lower revenue for the year from delays in orders and the government sequestration in the united states during the first half of 2013 which were offset by revenue growth in the second half of the year specifically in europe as well as incremental revenue from price increases new products and crossbranding initiatives 

foreign currency translation was unfavorable by 4 million  for 2013  as compared to 2012  

applied water 

applied water’s revenue increased 20 million  or 14  in 2013  a 04  increase on a constant currency basis the growth on a constant currency basis was driven by organic revenue growth predominately due to irrigation and industrial water applications 

organic revenue increased 5 million  or 04  for the year primarily due to irrigation application revenue caused by drought conditions in the united states strength in the industrial water application also bolstered revenue particularly within china from large fire pump projects as well as in northern europe from increased industrial multistage pump revenue these revenue increases were partially offset by weakness in europe particularly within the residential and commercial building services markets of southern europe combined with sluggish industrial and commercial building service markets in the united states and latin america 

foreign currency translation was favorable by 9 million  for 2013  as compared to 2012  

ordersbacklog 

orders received during 2013  increased by 130 million  or 34  to  3912 million  a 34  increase on a constant currency basis these amounts include a benefit of 87 million  from acquisitions organic order growth was 43 million  for the year 

the water infrastructure segment orders increased 89 million  or 37  to 2510 million   38  growth on a constant currency basis including 87 million  from acquisitions organic orders increased slightly primarily due to a strong second half of 2013 driven by higher transport volume from europe public utilities and the dewatering business combined with healthy growth in emerging markets orders increased in our applied water segment 45 million  or 32  to 1468 million   27  growth on a constant currency basis driven by strong performance in the commercial building services and industrial water markets in china as well as orders within the residential building services and agriculture markets in the united states during 2013 partially offset by weakness in southern europe across all end markets 

delivery schedules vary from customer to customer based upon their requirements typically large projects require longer lead production cycles and delays can occur from time to time total backlog was 707 million  at 

december 31 2013  and 647 million  at december 31 2012  we anticipate that more than 90 of the backlog at december 31 2013  will be recognized as revenue during 2014  

gross margin 

gross margins as a percentage of consolidated revenue declined to 391  in 2013  from 396  in 2012  the decrease is attributable to negative price realization geographic sales mix and additional costs associated with recent acquisitions these negative impacts were partially mitigated by benefits from restructuring savings and cost saving initiatives such as lean six sigma and global sourcing 

operating expenses 



selling general and administrative expenses 

sga increased by 72 million  or 79  to 986 million  or 257  of revenue in 2013  as compared to 914 million  or 241  of revenue in 2012  the increase in sga expenses as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to the combined impacts from the legal settlement with xylem group llc and costs incurred for the change in our chief executive officer of 20 million the increase was also driven by realignment costs of 17 million during 2013 incurred by the company to reposition our european business in an effort to optimize our cost structure and improve our operational efficiency and effectiveness acquisitions increased pension costs and investments in growth platforms also contributed to the increase 

research and development expenses 

rd spending decreased 2 million  or 19  to 104 million  or 27  of revenue for 2013  as compared to 106 million  or 28  of revenue in 2012  

restructuring and asset impairment charges 

during 2013  we incurred restructuring costs of 31 million and 9 million in our water infrastructure and applied water segments respectively these charges were incurred primarily in an effort to realign our organizational structure in europe and north america to address declines in sales volumes and optimize our cost structure the charges relate to the reduction in structural costs including a decrease in headcount and consolidation of facilities during 2012  we recognized restructuring charges of 17 million  related to restructuring related severance payments for manufacturing reduction in force initiatives primarily within our water infrastructure segment 

total expected costs associated with actions that commenced during 2013 are approximately 33 million  for water infrastructure and approximately 10 million  for applied water these costs primarily comprise severance charges these actions are expected to continue through 2014 as a result of actions initiated during 2013 we achieved net savings of approximately 13 million in 2013 and estimate annual future net savings beginning in 2014 of approximately 38 million 

additionally in the fourth quarter of 2013 we recorded a 2 million impairment charge related to three trade names in our water infrastructure segment associated with acquired businesses within our analytics operating unit reflecting a decline in their value since being acquired refer to note 11 “goodwill and other intangible assets” for additional information 

separation costs 

we had nonrecurring separation costs of 4 million  and 22 million  or 2 million  and 16 million  after tax during 2013  and 2012  respectively the components of separation costs incurred during these periods are presented below 



operating income 

we generated operating income of 363 million  during 2013  an 80 million or 181  decrease from the prior year operating income of 443 million  primarily reflecting higher operating expenses as increased sga and restructuring and asset impairment charges more than offset reductions from lower separation costs and savings from restructuring activities the following table illustrates operating income results by business segments for 2013  and 2012  



the table included below provides a reconciliation from segment operating income to adjusted operating income and a calculation of the corresponding adjusted operating margin 



nm not meaningful percentage change 

 water infrastructure 

operating income for our water infrastructure segment decreased 71 million  or 208  decreased 42 million  or 115  on an adjusted basis compared with the prior year the 115  decrease was driven by lower volume inflation unfavorable foreign exchange impacts costs associated with the establishment of our european headquarters and investments in growth platforms specifically acquisitions and new product launches the decrease was partially offset by restructuring savings and cost reduction initiatives such as global sourcing and lean six sigma 

applied water 

operating income for our applied water segment decreased 3 million  or 18  increased 6 million  or 34  on an adjusted basis compared to the prior year the 34  increase was driven by lean initiatives global sourcing and price realization partially offset by inflation and new product development 

interest expense 

interest expense was 55 million  for both 2013  and 2012  reflecting the same full year of interest expense related to the issuance of 12 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes issued in september 2011 refer to note 14  “credit facilities and longterm debt” for further details 

income tax expense 

the income tax provision for 2013  was 70 million  at an effective tax rate of 235  compared to 91 million  at an effective tax rate of 234  in 2012  the 2013  effective tax rate is higher than 2012  due to an increase in foreign repatriations partially offset by mix of earnings 

other comprehensive incomeloss 

other comprehensive income of 74 million  in 2013  compared to a loss of 30 million  in 2012  an improvement of 104 million was primarily due to a 34 million  net gain in 2013 as compared to a net loss of 84 million  in 2012 related to postretirement benefit plans the net gain in 2013 was due to an increase in discount rates as well as actual gains on plan assets in excess of the assumed longterm rate of return as compared to the net loss in 2012 which was due to a reduction in discount rates partially mitigated by actual gains on plan assets in excess of the assumed longterm rate of return this yearoveryear improvement was partially offset by a 33 million reduction in foreign currency translation benefit primarily due to the euro strengthening against the us dollar the effective tax rate on other comprehensive income decreased as compared to 2012 due primarily to the shift in comprehensive earnings from foreign currency translation which is not taxable as well as from a change in the jurisdictional mix of net gainslosses from postretirement benefit plans 

2012 versus 2011 

revenue 

revenue generated for 2012 was 3791 million a decrease of 12 million or 03 compared to 3803 million in 2011 on a constant currency basis revenue grew 25 the following table illustrates the impact from organic growth recent acquisitions and fluctuations in foreign currency in relation to revenue during the annual 2012 period 



 the following table summarizes revenue by segment for 2012 and 2011 



water infrastructure 

water infrastructure’s revenue increased 9 million or 04 in 2012 37 on a constant currency basis including incremental revenue of 94 million from acquisitions consisting of ysi in 2011 and mjk and heartland in 2012 the acquisitions of ysi and mjk contributed 90 million of the incremental revenue as we continued our expansion in the analytical instrumentation market 

organic revenue decreased 6 million or 02 during the year which was primarily attributable to weakness in the transport and treatment markets as well as sustained drought conditions within the united states transport and treatment decreased mostly due to a decline in the public utility sector of developed markets caused by a weak capital project environment and delays on shipments these declines were partially offset by strength in emerging markets specifically in the latin america and asia pacific regions the results also reflect decreases in the dewatering rental and equipment sales as a result of the unfavorable dry weather conditions within north america and lower coal and gas prices offset slightly by a benefit from super storm sandy overall growth was also muted by continued weakness in europe as a result of challenging economic conditions 

foreign currency translation was unfavorable by 80 million for 2012 as compared to 2011 

applied water 

applied water’s revenue decreased 20 million or 14 in 2012 a 08 increase on a constant currency basis the growth on a constant currency basis was driven by organic revenue growth 

organic revenue grew 9 million or 06 for the year and was principally due to strength in the industrial water sector from a favorable general industrial market across most regions especially within the united states russia and asia pacific markets the residential and commercial pumps business increased slightly due to favorable growth in the united states but was mostly eclipsed by declines from the weak economic conditions in europe the warm dry weather conditions in north america also drove an increase in the agriculture end market for the year 

foreign currency translation was unfavorable by 32 million for 2012 as compared to 2011 

ordersbacklog 

orders received during 2012 decreased by 65 million or 17 to 3782 million a 13 increase on a constant currency basis these amounts include a benefit of 95 million from acquisitions organic order decline was 46 million for the year 

the water infrastructure segment orders decreased 33 million or 13 to 2421 million 22 growth on a constant currency basis including 95 million from acquisitions organic order volume decreased primarily due to the delays in public utility capital expenditure orders coupled with reduced dewatering volumes from dry weather conditions and slowdowns in the oil gas and mining markets orders declined in our applied water segment 29 million or 20 to 1423 million 01 growth on a constant currency basis driven by declining organic orders of 04 the decline in organic order volume is primarily a result of the warm winter weather conditions in the united states and asia pacific markets impacting the building services end markets partially offset by strength in the industrial and agriculture markets 

delivery schedules vary from customer to customer based upon their requirements typically large projects require longer lead production cycles and delays can occur from time to time total backlog was 647 million at december 31 2012 and 651 million at december 31 2011 

gross margin 

gross margins as a percentage of consolidated revenue increased to 396 in 2012 from 384 in 2011 the increase is attributable to benefits from price realization initiatives and cost improvements offset in part by an unfavorable sales mix and inflation 

operating expenses 



selling general and administrative expenses 

sga increased by 37 million or 42 to 914 million or 241 of revenue in 2012 as compared to 877 million or 231 of revenue in 2011 the increase in sga expenses is principally due to the impact of incremental costs as a standalone company and costs related to the mjk and heartland acquisitions 

additionally in 2012 we incurred 7 million of realignment costs relating to realigning our european businesses to improve our operational efficiencies 

research and development expenses 

rd spending increased 6 million or 60 to 106 million or 28 of revenue for 2012 as compared to 100 million or 26 of revenue in 2011 these increases were primarily due to the impact from recent acquisitions as well as costs associated with the launching of new products 

restructuring and asset impairment charges 

during 2012 we incurred restructuring costs of 17 million primarily related to restructuringrelated severance payments for reductions in force initiatives primarily within our water infrastructure segment during 2011 we incurred a 2 million charge related to the impairment of a facility in our applied water segment as of december 31 2012 we consider those restructuring initiatives commenced to date to be substantially completed with a remaining liability of 9 million related to the 2012 restructuring actions 

separation costs 

we had nonrecurring pretax separation costs of 22 million and 87 million or 16 million and 72 million after tax during 2012 and 2011 respectively the components of separation costs incurred during these periods are presented below 



 operating income 

we generated operating income of 443 million during 2012 a 122 increase from the prior year primarily reflecting the benefits achieved from cost reductions and price improvements offset in part by an unfavorable sales mix acquisition costs and nonrecurring separation costs the following table illustrates operating income results by business segments for 2012 and 2011 



the table included below provides a reconciliation from segment operating income to adjusted operating income and a calculation of the corresponding adjusted operating margin 



 water infrastructure 

operating income for our water infrastructure segment decreased 1 million or 03 increased 6 million or 17 excluding separation restructuring and realignment costs compared with the prior year the 17 increase was predominately driven by incremental operating income of 20 million from the acquisitions of ysi mjk and heartland combined with price realization efforts and operating cost reductions these benefits were largely offset by inflation costs on labor and material as well as unfavorable mix from lower dewatering revenue and higher revenue in emerging markets 

applied water 

operating income for our applied water segment increased 10 million or 63 4 million or 23 excluding separation restructuring and realignment costs compared to the prior year the 23 increase is primarily attributable to operating cost reductions put in place by the company and savings achieved from restructuring actions in the latter part of 2011 the increases were offset in part by lower sales volume an unfavorable sales mix and inflationary pressures on labor and materials 

interest expense 

interest expense was 55 million and 17 million for 2012 and 2011 respectively the increase during the current year reflected a full year of interest expense related to the issuance of 12 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes issued in september 2011 refer to note 14  “credit facilities and longterm debt” for further details

the income tax provision for 2012 was 91 million at an effective tax rate of 234 compared to 104 million at an effective tax rate of 274 in 2011 the 2012 effective tax rate is lower than 2011 as a result of the decrease in nondeductible separation costs and a change in the mix of earnings 

effective january 1 2013 the swedish government enacted legislation that will increase the effective tax rate of the company the company has implemented strategies to address the impact of this legislation 

other comprehensive incomeloss 

other comprehensive loss was 30 million  in 2012 compared to a loss of 132 million  in 2011 primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign currency translation adjustments in 2012 versus the unfavorable impact in 2011 in 2012 foreign currency translation adjustment was a positive impact of 48 million as compared to 2011 which was a negative impact of 61 million the yearoveryear change was primarily due to movements in the euro against the us dollar other comprehensive loss was further impacted by a loss from postretirement benefit plans of 84 million loss in 2012 compared to 74 million loss in 2011 this was primarily due to net foreign exchange losses experienced on the benefit obligations which more than offset net foreign exchange gains on plan assets the effective tax rate on other comprehensive income increased as compared to 2011 due primarily to the shift in comprehensive earnings from foreign currency translation which is not taxable as well as from a change in the jurisdictional mix of net gainslosses from postretirement benefit plans 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash 



sources and uses of liquidity 

operating activities 

during 2013  net cash provided by operating activities was 324 million  compared to 396 million  in 2012  the 72 million  yearoveryear decrease was driven by an increase in the use of working capital in both segments due to increased accounts receivable primarily from longer collection times in europe and increased inventories to support a higher backlog as well as to be able to support shorter lead times additionally revenue volume declines during the first half of 2013 reduced cash inflow from income payments made for restructuring and realignment activities in 2013 also contributed to the decline largely offset by lower tax payments 

during 2012  net cash provided by operating activities was 396 million  compared to 449 million  in 2011  the 53 million  yearoveryear decrease is primarily the result of interest payments on debt of 53 million in 2012 higher tax payments of 40 million and additional contributions to postretirement benefit plans partially offset by an increase in receivable collections and a decline in payments for separation costs 

investing activities 

cash used in investing activities was 199 million  for 2013  compared to 147 million  in 2012  and 423 million  in 2011  the changes in investing activities are driven almost entirely by cash used for acquisitions and to a lesser extent from changes in spending on capital expenditures we invested 81 million for the acquisitions during 2013 while 41 million was used in 2012 and 309 million in 2011 capital expenditures for 2013  of 126 million were 14 million greater than in 2012 primarily due to information technology investments within both the applied water segment and corporate as a result of system requirements subsequent to the spinoff from itt in addition to capital expenditures required for the relocation of our corporate headquarters as required by the spinoff from itt in 2012 we spent 112 million  on capital expenditures a decrease of 14 million over 2011 primarily due to a reduction in dewatering asset purchases to align with current rental demand 

financing activities 

cash used by financing activities was 100 million  and 74 million  during 2013  and 2012  respectively compared to cash provided by financing activities of 172 million  during 2011  the increase in cash used for financing activities in 2013  compared to 2012 was primarily driven by an increase in share repurchase activity of 60 million and an increase in dividend payments of 12 million the 2013 share repurchase activity was impacted by 50 million of 

repurchases under a new share repurchase program approved on august 20 2013 by the board of directors to repurchase up to 250 million in shares 

additionally there was an increase in shortterm debt for borrowings under the european investment bank facility of 38 million in 2013 the decrease in financing activities from 2011 to 2012 was primarily attributable to net proceeds from the issuance of 12 billion in senior notes which funded a net cash transfer of 1 billion to our former parent itt in 2011 in general the components of net transfers to itt included i cash transfers from the company to parent ii cash investments from our parent used to fund operations capital expenditures and acquisitions iii charges benefits for income taxes and iv allocations of the parent company’s corporate expenses described in this report 

funding and liquidity strategy 

our ability to fund our capital needs depends on our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access to the bank and capital markets 

our global funding requirements are continually monitored with appropriate strategies executed to ensure liquidity needs are met cost effectively based on our current global cash positions cash flows for operations and access to the commercial paper markets we believe there is sufficient liquidity to meet our funding requirements in addition our existing committed credit facilities and access to the public debt markets would provide further liquidity if required 

historically we have generated operating cash flow sufficient to fund our primary cash needs centered on operating activities working capital capital expenditures and strategic investments if our cash flows from operations are less than we expect we may need to incur debt or issue equity from time to time we may need to access the longterm and shortterm capital markets to obtain financing our access to and the availability of financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors including i our credit ratings or absence of a credit rating ii the liquidity of the overall capital markets and iii the current state of the economy there can be no assurance that we will continue to have access to the capital markets on terms acceptable to us we cannot assure that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or that such financing will be available at all 

we anticipate that our present sources of funds including funds from operations will provide us with sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet our liquidity and capital needs in both the united states and outside of the united states over the next twelve months 

senior notes 

on september 20 2011 we issued 3550 senior notes of 600 million aggregate principal amount due september 2016 the senior notes due 2016 and 4875 senior notes of 600 million aggregate principal amount due october 2021 the senior notes due 2021 and together with the senior notes due 2016 the senior notes 

the senior notes include covenants which restrict our ability subject to exceptions to incur debt secured by liens and engage in sale and leaseback transactions as well as provide for customary events of default subject in certain cases to receipt of notice of default andor customary grace and cure periods we may redeem the senior notes as applicable in whole or in part at any time at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the senior notes to be redeemed plus a makewhole premium as of december 31 2013  we were in compliance with all covenants if a change of control triggering event as defined in the senior notes indenture occurs we will be required to make an offer to purchase the senior notes at a price equal to 101 of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase 

interest on the senior notes due 2016 is payable on march 20 and september 20 of each year interest on the senior notes due 2021 is payable on april 1 and october 1 of each year 

four year competitive advance and revolving credit facility 

effective october 31 2011 xylem and its subsidiaries entered into a four year competitive advance and revolving credit facility the credit facility with jpmorgan chase bank na as administrative agent and a syndicate of lenders the credit facility provides for an aggregate principal amount of up to 600 million of i a competitive advance borrowing option which will be provided on an uncommitted competitive advance basis through an auction 

mechanism the competitive loans ii revolving extensions of credit the revolving loans outstanding at any time and iii the issuance of letters of credit in a face amount not in excess of 100 million outstanding at any time 

at our election the interest rate per annum applicable to the competitive advances will be based on either i a eurodollar rate determined by reference to libor plus an applicable margin offered by the lender making such loans and accepted by us or ii a fixed percentage rate per annum specified by the lender making such loans at our election interest rate per annum applicable to the revolving loans will be based on either i a eurodollar rate determined by reference to libor adjusted for statutory reserve requirements plus an applicable margin or ii a fluctuating rate of interest determined by reference to the greatest of a the prime rate of jpmorgan chase bank na b the us federal funds effective rate plus half of 1 or c the eurodollar rate determined by reference to libor adjusted for statutory reserve requirements in each case plus an applicable margin 

in accordance with the terms we may not exceed a maximum leverage ratio of 350 based on a ratio of total debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization throughout the term as of december 31 2013  we were in compliance with all covenants the credit facility also contains limitations on among other things incurring debt granting liens and entering sale and leaseback transactions in addition the credit facility contains other terms and conditions such as customary representations and warranties additional covenants and customary events of default 

as of december 31 2013  this credit facility remains undrawn 

research and development facility agreement 

on december 4 2013 the company amended and restated its risk sharing finance facility agreement the rd facility agreement with the european investment bank the eib to add an additional borrower under the facility the facility provides an aggregate principal amount of up to   €120 million   approximately 165 million  to finance research projects and infrastructure development in the european union the companys whollyowned subsidiaries in luxembourg xylem holdings sarl and xylem international sarl are the borrowers under the rd facility agreement the obligations of the borrowers under the rd facility agreement are guaranteed by the company under an amended and restated deed of guarantee dated as of december 4 2013 in favor of the eib the funds are available to finance research and development projects during the period from 2013 through 2016 at the companys rd facilities in sweden germany italy the united kingdom austria norway and hungary 

under the rd facility agreement the borrower can draw loans with a maturity of no longer than 12 years the rd facility agreement provides for fixed rate loans and floating rate loans the interest rate per annum applicable to fixed rate loans will be at a fixed percentage rate per annum specified by the eib which includes the applicable margin the interest rate per annum applicable to floating rate loans will be at the rate determined by reference to euribor for loans drawn in euros and libor for loans drawn in pounds sterling or us dollars plus an applicable spread specified by the eib which includes the applicable margin the applicable margin for both fixed rate loans and floating rate loans shall be determined by reference to the credit rating of the company 

in accordance with the terms of the rd facility agreement we may not exceed a maximum leverage ratio of 350   based on a ratio of total debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization throughout the term as of   december 31 2013  we were in compliance with all covenants the rd facility agreement also contains limitations on among other things incurring debt granting liens and entering sale and leaseback transactions in addition the rd facility agreement contains other terms and conditions such as customary representations and warranties additional covenants and customary events of default 

as of december 31 2013  38 million   was outstanding under the rd facility agreement  although the borrowing term for this arrangement is for five years we have classified it as shortterm debt on our consolidated balance sheet since we intend to repay this obligation in less than one year 

nonus operations 

for 2013  and 2012  we generated 62  and 63  respectively of our revenue from nonus operations as we continue to grow our operations in the emerging markets and elsewhere outside of the united states we expect to continue to generate significant revenue from nonus operations and we expect our cash will be predominately held by our foreign subsidiaries we expect to manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed we may transfer cash from certain international subsidiaries to the us and other international subsidiaries when it is cost effective to do so our intent is to indefinitely reinvest all but 84 million  of 

these funds outside of the united states however we continually review our domestic and foreign cash profile expected future cash generation and investment opportunities that support our current designation of these funds as being indefinitely reinvested and reassess whether there is a demonstrated need to repatriate funds held internationally to support our us operations if as a result of our review it is determined that all or a portion of the funds may be needed for our operations in the united states we would be required to accrue us taxes related to future tax payments associated with the repatriation of these funds as of december 31 2013  our foreign subsidiaries were holding 423 million  in cash or marketable securities 

as of december 31 2013  our excess of financial reporting over the tax basis of investments in certain foreign subsidiaries totaled 19 billion  we have not asserted that 84 million  of our excess basis difference will be indefinitely reinvested and have therefore provided for united states or additional foreign withholding taxes for that portion generally such amounts become subject to us taxation upon the remittance of dividends and under certain other circumstances 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual commitments as of december 31 2013  



in addition to the amounts presented in the table above we have recorded liabilities for uncertain tax positions of 30 million  these amounts have been excluded from the contractual obligations table due to an inability to reasonably estimate the timing of such payments in individual years further benefit payments which reflect expected future service related to the companys pension and other postretirement employee benefit obligations are presented in note 15  “postretirement benefit plans” and not included in the above table finally estimated environmental payments are excluded from the table above we estimate based on historical experience that we will spend between 1 million and 4 million per year on environmental investigation and remediation at december 31 2013  we had estimated and accrued 8 million  related to environmental matters 

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2013  we have issued guarantees for the debt and other obligations of consolidated subsidiaries we do not consider the maximum exposure to be material either individually or in the aggregate 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 

significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated and combined financial statements are discussed in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” in the notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider 

most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they are inherently uncertain involve significant judgments include areas where different estimates reasonably could have been used and changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable however actual results in these areas could differ from management’s estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

revenue recognition  we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured for product sales delivery does not occur until the products have been shipped risk of loss has been transferred to the customer and the contractual terms have been fulfilled in instances where contractual terms include a provision for customer acceptance revenue is recognized when either i we have previously demonstrated that the product meets the specified criteria based on either seller or customerspecified objective criteria or ii upon formal acceptance received from the customer where the product has not been previously demonstrated to meet customerspecified objective criteria revenue on service and repair contracts is recognized after services have been agreed to by the customer and rendered 

we enter into contracts to sell our products and services and while the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions certain agreements contain multiple elements or nonstandard terms and conditions where sales agreements contain multiple elements or nonstandard terms and conditions judgment is required to determine the appropriate accounting including whether the deliverables specified in these agreements should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes and if so how the transaction price should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize revenue for each element when a sale involves multiple deliverables the total revenue from the arrangement is allocated to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price of the deliverable to all other deliverables in the contract revenue for multiple element arrangements is recognized when the appropriate revenue recognition criteria for the individual deliverable have been satisfied the allocation of sales price between elements may impact the timing of revenue recognition but will not change the total revenue recognized on the arrangement for delivered elements accounted for as separate units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement revenue is recognized only when the delivered elements have standalone value there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance and there are no customernegotiated refund or return rights affecting the sales recognized 

we record a reduction in revenue at the time of sale for estimated product returns rebates and other allowances based on historical experience and known trends 

warranty accrual  accruals for estimated expenses related to warranties are made at the time products are sold or services are rendered and are recorded as a component of cost of revenue these accruals are established using historical information on the nature frequency and average cost of warranty claims and consider any factors that may cause differences in expected future warranty costs as compared to historical claim experience while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes we base our estimated warranty obligation on product warranty terms offered to customers ongoing product failure rates material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure as well as specific product class failures outside of our baseline experience we assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities quarterly and adjust amounts as necessary 

income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities applying enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences will reverse based on the evaluation of available evidence we recognize future tax benefits such as net operating loss carryforwards to the extent that we believe it is more likely than not we will realize these benefits we periodically assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets and reflect any changes to our estimate of the amount we are more likely than not to realize in the valuation allowance with a corresponding adjustment to earnings or other comprehensive income as appropriate 

in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we look to the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences taxable income in carryback years and the feasibility of tax planning strategies and estimated future taxable income the valuation allowance can be affected by changes to tax laws changes to statutory tax rates and changes to future taxable income estimates 

our effective tax rate reflects the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which we have not provided us taxes because we plan to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside the united states we plan foreign earnings remittance amounts based on projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and longterm 

investment requirements of our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic operations based on these assumptions we estimate the amount we will distribute to the united states and provide the us federal taxes due on these amounts material changes in our estimates of cash working capital and longterm investment requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we do business could impact our effective tax rate 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and to the extent to which additional taxes will be due furthermore we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

we adjust our liability for uncertain tax positions in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional tax expense would result if a payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 

goodwill and intangible assets  we review goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable we also review the carrying value of our finitelived intangible assets for potential impairment when impairment indicators arise we conduct our annual impairment test as of the first day of the fourth quarter we perform a twostep impairment test for goodwill in the first step we compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds its fair value then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to measure the impairment loss to be recorded if any if the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value then we record an impairment loss equal to the difference in our annual impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets we compare the fair value of those assets to their carrying value we recognize an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying value we estimate the fair value of our reporting units and intangible assets with indefinite lives using an income approach under the income approach we calculate fair value based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinitelived intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions particularly related to future operating results and cash flows these estimates and assumptions include but are not limited to revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates assumed royalty rates future economic and market conditions and identification of appropriate market comparable data in addition the identification of reporting units and the allocation of assets and liabilities to the reporting units when determining the carrying value of each reporting unit also require judgment goodwill is tested for impairment at either the operating segment identified in note 21  “industry segment and geographic data” of the consolidated and combined financial statements or one level below the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets is based on estimates and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable significant changes to these estimates and assumptions could adversely impact our conclusions actual future results may differ from those estimates 

during the fourth quarter of 2013 we performed our annual impairment assessment and determined that that the estimated fair values of our goodwill reporting units were substantially in excess of each of their carrying values with the exception of our analytics business within our water infrastructure segment while the fair value of the analytics business initially increased over the first couple of years after acquisition challenging economic conditions including reduced government spending in the us and sluggish growth in european markets have led to a reduction in fair value during the past two years our 2013 impairment analysis indicated that the fair value of the analytics reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 18  the goodwill associated with the analytics business was 439 million  at december 31 2013 however future goodwill impairment tests could result in a charge to earnings we will continue to evaluate goodwill on an annual basis as of the beginning of our fourth quarter and whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate there may be a potential impairment 

during the fourth quarter of 2013 we performed our annual impairment test of our indefinitelived intangibles assets which resulted in an impairment charge of 2 million related to trade names within our water infrastructure segment refer to note 11  “goodwill and other intangible assets” for additional information 

postretirement plans company employees around the world participate in numerous defined benefit pension plans the determination of projected benefit obligations and the recognition of expenses related to these pension plans are dependent on various assumptions these major assumptions primarily relate to discount rates expected longterm rates of return on plan assets rate of future compensation increases mortality health care inflation and termination some of which are disclosed in note 15  “postretirement benefit plans” in the notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements and other factors actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and are amortized generally over the estimated future working life of the plan participants or for plans with all or substantially all inactive participants over the average remaining life expectancy 

significant assumptions 

management develops each assumption using relevant company experience in conjunction with marketrelated data for each individual country in which such plans exist all assumptions are reviewed annually with thirdparty consultants and adjusted as necessary the table included below provides the weighted average assumptions used to estimate our defined benefit pension obligations and costs as of and for the years ended 2013  and 2012  



 we determine the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets by evaluating both historical returns and estimates of future returns specifically the company analyzes the estimated future returns based on independent estimates of asset class returns and evaluates historical broad market returns over longterm timeframes based on the strategic asset allocation which is detailed in note 15  “postretirement benefit plans” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

based on the approach described above the chart below shows weighted average actual returns versus the weighted average expected longterm rates of return for our pension plans that were utilized in the calculation of the net periodic pension cost for each respective year 



for the recognition of net periodic pension cost the calculation of the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is generally derived using a marketrelated value of plan assets based on average asset values at the measurement date over the last five years the use of fair value rather than a calculated value could materially affect net periodic pension cost our weighted average expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for all pension plans effective january 1 2014  is 738  we estimate that every 25 basis point change in the expected return on plan assets impacts the expense by 1 million 

the discount rate reflects our expectation of the present value of expected future cash payments for benefits at the measurement date a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases 

pension expense we base the discount rate assumption on current investment yields of highquality fixed income investments during the retirement benefits maturity period the pension discount rate was determined by considering an interest rate yield curve comprising aaaaa bonds with maturities between zero and thirty years developed by the plan’s actuaries annual benefit payments are then discounted to present value using this yield curve to develop a singlepoint discount rate matching the plan’s characteristics our weighted average discount rate for all pension plans effective january 1 2014  is 429  we estimate that every 25 basis point change in the discount rate impacts the expense by 1 million 

the rate of future compensation increase assumption reflects our longterm actual experience and future and nearterm outlook effective january 1 2014  our expected rate of future compensation is 348 for all pension plans the estimated impact of a 25 basis point change in the expected rate of future compensation is less than 1 million 

the assumed rate of future increases in the per capita cost of health care the health care trend rate is 719  for 2014  decreasing ratably to 500 in 2020 an increase or decrease in the health care trend rates by one percent per year would impact the aggregate annual service and interest components by less than 1 million and impact the benefit obligation by approximately 8 million to the extent that actual experience differs from these assumptions the effect will be amortized over the average future service of the covered active employees 

we currently anticipate making contributions to our pension and postretirement benefit plans in the range of 40 million  to 50 million  during 2014  of which 11 million  is expected to be made in the first quarter 

funded status 

funded status is derived by subtracting the respective yearend values of the projected benefit obligations from the fair value of plan assets we estimate that every 25 basis point change in the discount rate impacts the funded status by approximately 25 million 

fair value of plan assets 

the plan assets of our pension plans comprise a broad range of investments including domestic and foreign equity securities interests in private equity and hedge funds fixed income investments insurance contracts real estate and cash and cash equivalents 

a portion of our pension benefit plan assets portfolio comprises investments in private equity and hedge funds the private equity and hedge fund investments are generally measured at net asset value however in certain instances the values reported by the asset managers were not current at the measurement date accordingly we made estimate adjustments to the last reported value where necessary to measure the assets at fair value at the measurement date these adjustments consider information received from the asset managers as well as general market information the adjustment recorded at december 31 2013  and 2012  for these assets represented less than one half of one percent of total plan assets in each respective year asset values for other positions were generally measured using market observable prices we estimate that a 5 change in asset values will impact funded status by approximately 24 million 

new accounting pronouncements 

see note 2  “recently issued accounting pronouncements” in the notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements for a complete discussion of recent accounting pronouncements there were no new pronouncements which we expect to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations in future periods 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign currency exchange and interest rates these exposures are actively monitored by management our exposure to foreign exchange rate risk is due to certain costs revenue and borrowings being denominated in currencies other than one of our subsidiaries functional currency similarly we are exposed to market risk as the result of changes in interest rates which may affect the cost of our financing it is our policy and practice to use derivative financial instruments only to the extent necessary to manage exposures 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

our foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to receipts from customers payments to suppliers and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies we may use derivative financial instruments to offset risk related to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers when it is believed that the exposure will not be limited by our normal operating and financing activities in january 2012 we began to enter into currency forward contracts periodically in order to manage the exchange rate fluctuation risk on certain intercompany transactions associated with third party sales and purchases our principal currency exposures relate to the euro swedish krona british pound australian dollar canadian dollar polish zloty and hungarian forint we estimate that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would not be material to xylem’s financial position and results of operations 

interest rate risk 

as of december 31 2013  we do not have a material exposure to interest rate risk as our debt portfolio entirely comprises longterm fixedrate instruments we do not account for our longterm debt using the fair value option 

commodity price exposures 

portions of our business are exposed to volatility in the prices of certain commodities such as copper nickel and aluminum among others our primary exposure to this volatility resides with the use of these materials in purchased component parts we generally maintain longterm fixed price contracts on raw materials and component parts however we are prone to exposure as these contracts expire we estimate that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in prices for raw metal commodities would not be material to our financial position and results of operations

 item 1 business 

business overview 

xylem with 2012  revenue of 38 billion  is a world leader in the design manufacturing and application of highly engineered technologies for the water industry with approximately 12700 employees we are a leading equipment and service provider for water and wastewater applications with a broad portfolio of products and services addressing the full cycle of water from collection distribution and use to the return of water to the environment we have leading market positions among equipment and service providers in the core application areas of the water equipment industry transport treatment test building services industrial processing and irrigation our company’s brands such as bell  gossett and flygt are well known throughout the industry and have served the water market for many years 

we operate in two segments water infrastructure and applied water the water infrastructure segment focuses on the transportation treatment and testing of water offering a range of products including water and wastewater pumps treatment and testing equipment and controls and systems key brands in this segment include flygt wedeco godwin pumps wtw sanitaire ysi and leopold the applied water segment encompasses the uses of water and focuses on the residential commercial industrial and agricultural markets the segment’s major products include pumps valves heat exchangers controls and dispensing equipment key brands in this segment include goulds water technology bell  gossett ac fire standard flojet lowara jabsco and flowtronex in both our segments we benefit from a large and growing installed base of products driving growth in aftermarket revenue for replacement parts and services 

we serve a global customer base across diverse end markets while offering localized expertise we sell our products in more than 150 countries through a balanced distribution network consisting of our direct sales force and independent channel partners in 2012  approximately 63  of our revenues were generated outside the united states 

our industry 

our planet faces a serious water challenge less than 1 of the total water available on earth is fresh water and this percentage is declining due to factors such as the draining of aquifers increased pollution and climate change in addition demand for fresh water is rising rapidly due to population growth industrial expansion and increased agricultural development with consumption estimated to double every 20 years by 2025 over 30 of the world’s population is expected to live in areas without adequate water supply even in developed countries with sufficient supply existing infrastructure for water supply is relatively underfunded and aging in the united states degrading pipe systems leak one out of every six gallons of water on average on its way from a treatment plant to the customer these challenges are driving opportunities for growth in the global water industry which we estimate to have a total market size of approximately 500 billion  

the water industry supply chain is comprised of equipment and services companies design and build service providers and water utilities equipment and service providers serve two distinct customer types the first utilities supply water through an infrastructure network companies that operate on this side of the supply chain provide single or sometimes combined functions from equipment manufacturing and services to facility design engineering procurement and construction or “epc” firms to plant operations utilities as depicted below in figure 1 the utility and epc customers are looking for technology and application expertise from their equipment and services providers due to trends such as rising pollution stricter regulations and the increased outsourcing of process knowledge the second customer type the end users of water comprises a wide array of entities ranging from farms to power plants to residential homes these customers are predominately served through specialized distributors and original equipment manufacturers “oems” 

figure 1 water industry supply chain based upon global water intelligence’s “global water market 2011” and management estimates 

our business focuses on the beginning of the supply chain by providing technologyintensive equipment and services we sell our equipment and services via direct and indirect channels that serve the needs of each customer type on the utility side we provide over 70 direct sales with strong application expertise with the remaining amount going through distribution partners to end users of water we provide over 85 of our sales through longstanding relationships with the world’s leading distributors with the remainder going direct to customers the total market opportunity for this equipment and services portion of the water industry supply chain is estimated at approximately 280 billion 

the equipment and services market addresses the key processes of the water industry which are best illustrated through the cycle of water as depicted in figure 2 below we believe this industry has two distinct sectors within the cycle of water supply infrastructure and usage applications the key processes of this cycle begin when raw water is extracted by pumps which provide the necessary pressure and flow to move or transport this water from natural sources such as lakes oceans or aquifers through pipes to a treatment facility treatment facilities can provide many forms of treatment such as filtration disinfection and desalination to remove solids bacteria and 

salt respectively a network of pipes and pumps again transports this clean water to where it is needed such as to crops for irrigation to power plants to provide cooling in industrial water or to an apartment building as drinking water in residential and commercial buildings after usage the wastewater is collected by a separate network of pipes and pumps and transported to a wastewater treatment facility where processes such as digestion deactivate and reduce the volume of solids and disinfection purifies effluent water once treated analytical instruments test the treated water to ensure regulatory requirements are met so that it can be discharged back to the environment thereby completing the cycle 

figure 2 cycle of water 

our two operating segments are aligned with each of the sectors in the cycle of water water infrastructure serves the supply infrastructure sector and applied water serves the usage applications sector within the supply infrastructure sector our pump systems transport water from aquifers lakes rivers and seas from there our filtration uv and ozone systems provide treatment making the water fit for use after consumption our pump lift stations move the wastewater to treatment facilities where our mixers biological treatment monitoring and control systems provide the primary functions in the treatment process throughout each of these stages our analytical systems test to ensure quality of water for consumption as well as for return to nature our served market size in this sector is approximately 20 billion 

in the usage applications sector we participate in all major areas of water demand agricultural irrigation constitutes approximately 70 of all water usage globally examples of what we provide include boosting systems for farming irrigation pumps for dairy operations and rainwater reuse systems for small scale crop and turf irrigation industrial processing applications account for approximately 20 of global consumption our pumps heat exchangers valves and controls provide cooling to power plants and manufacturing facilities as well as circulation for food and beverage processing the remaining 10 of global water use resides in human and building consumption where we deliver water boosting systems for drinking heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac and fire protection systems to residential and commercial building services our served market size in this sector is estimated at 15 billion 

customers in the water industry vary by end market two end markets exist within the supply infrastructure sector public utility and industrial representing 85 and 15 of the total equipment and services market respectively the public utility market comprises public private and publicprivate institutions that handle water and wastewater for mostly residential and commercial purposes the industrial market involves the supply of water and removal of wastewater for industrial facilities we view the main macro drivers of this sector to be water quality the desire for energyefficient products water scarcity and infrastructure needs for both the repair of aging systems in developed countries as well as new installations in emerging markets these markets tend to be less cyclical and are estimated to grow annually in the low to midsingle digits through 2015 according to management estimates 

in the usage applications sector enduse customers fall into four main markets residential commercial industrial and agricultural homeowners represent the end users in the residential market owners and managers of properties such as apartment buildings retail stores restaurants hospitals and hotels are examples of end users in the commercial market the industrial market is wide ranging involving developers and managers of facilities operated by electrical power generators chemical manufacturers machine shops clothing manufacturers beverage production and dispensing firms and car washes the agricultural market end users are owners and operators of businesses such as crop and livestock farms aquaculture golf courses and other turf applications we believe population growth and urbanization are the two primary macro drivers of these markets as these trends drive the need for housing food community services and retail goods within growing city centers water reuse and conservation are driving the need for new technologies annual total market growth in these industrial commercial residential and agricultural markets is estimated to be in the low to midsingle digits through 2015 according to management estimates 

business strategy 

our strategy is focused on enhancing shareholder value by providing solutions for our customers and by growing revenues both organically and through strategic acquisitions as well as streamlining our cost structure key elements of our strategy are summarized below

distribution training and end use 

water infrastructure provides more than 70 of its sales through direct channels with remaining sales through indirect channels and service capabilities both public utility and industrial facility customers increasingly require our teams’ global but locally proficient expertise to use our equipment in their specific applications several trends are 

increasing the need for this application expertise i the increase in type and amount of contaminants in water supply ii increasing environmental regulations iii the need to increase system efficiencies due to rising energy costs and iv the retirement of a largely aging water industry workforce not systematically replaced at utilities 

in the applied water segment many enduse areas are widely different so specialized distribution partners are often preferred our commercial teams have built longstanding relationships around our brands in many of these industries through which we can continue to leverage new product and service applications revenue opportunities are balanced between oem and aftermarket customers our products in the applied water segment are sold through our global direct sales and worldclass indirect channels with more than 85 of revenue going through indirect channels we have longstanding relationships with the leading independent distributors in the markets we serve and we provide incentives to distributors such as specialized training programs to sell our products exclusively 

aftermarket parts and service 

we have more than 120 service centers around the world which employ approximately 600 service employees to provide aftermarket parts and services to our customers during their lifecycle installed products require maintenance repair services and parts due to the harsh environments in which they operate 

in addition depending on the type of product median lifecycles range from 5 years to over 50 years at which time they must be replaced many of our products are precisely selected and applied within a larger network of equipment driving a strong preference by customers and installers to replace them with the same exact brand and model when they reach the end of their lifecycle this dynamic establishes a large recurring revenue stream for our business 

supply and seasonality 

we have a global manufacturing footprint with production facilities in europe north america latin america and asia in addition we maintain a global network of service centers providing aftermarket customer care service centers offer an array of integrated service solutions for the industry including preventive monitoring contract maintenance emergency field service engineered upgrades inventory management and overhauls for pumps and other rotating equipment 

we offer a wide range of highly engineered products we primarily employ configuretoorder capabilities to maximize manufacturing and logistics efficiencies by producing high volumes of basic product configurations when we provide a configuretoorder solution we configure a standard product to our customers’ specifications to a lesser extent we provide engineertoorder products to meet the customization requirements of our customers this process requires that we apply our technical expertise and production capabilities to provide a nonstandard solution to the customer 

our inventory management and distribution practices seek to minimize inventory holding periods by taking delivery of the inventory and manufacturing immediately prior to the sale or distribution of products to our customers all of our businesses require various parts and raw materials of which the availability and prices may fluctuate parts and raw materials commonly used in our products include motors fabricated parts castings bearings seals nickel copper aluminum and plastics while we may recover some cost increases through operational improvements we are still exposed to some pricing risk we attempt to control costs through fixedpriced contracts with suppliers and various other programs such as our global strategic sourcing initiative 

our business relies on thirdparty suppliers contract manufacturing and commodity markets to secure raw materials parts and components used in our products we typically acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our materials requirements for most of our products we have existing alternate sources of supply or such sources are readily available 

we may experience price volatility or supply constraints for materials that are not available from multiple sources from time to time we acquire certain inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longerterm pricing commitments with vendors to improve the priority price and availability of supply there have been no raw material shortages that have had a significant adverse impact on our business as a whole 

our water infrastructure and applied water segments experience some modest level of seasonality in its business water infrastructures revenue is generally higher in the fourth quarter and lower in the first quarter as a result of capital spending patterns of its customer base as well as weather patterns primarily in north america applied 

waters seasonality is primarily driven by its hvac residential pumps and irrigations businesses resulting in higher revenues during the second and third quarters of the year 

customers 

our business is not dependent on any single customer or a few customers the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on the respective market or on us as a whole no individual customer accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated 2012  revenue 

backlog 

delivery schedules vary from customer to customer based upon their requirements typically large projects require longer lead production cycles and delays can occur from time to time total backlog was 647 million  at december 31 2012  and 651 million  at december 31 2011  we anticipate that in excess of 90  of the backlog at december 31 2012  will be recognized as revenue during 2013  

competition 

given the highly fragmented nature of the water industry water infrastructure competes with a large number of businesses competition in the water transport and treatment technologies markets focuses on product performance application expertise design quality delivery and price in the sale of products and services we benefit from our large installed base of pumps and complementary products which require maintenance repair and replacement parts due to the nature of the products and the conditions under which they operate timeliness of delivery quality and the proximity of service centers are important customer considerations when selecting a provider for aftermarket products and services as well as equipment rentals in geographic regions where we are locally positioned to provide a quick response customers have historically relied on us rather than our competitors for aftermarket products relating to our highly engineered and customized solutions our key competitors within the water infrastructure segment include ksb inc sulzer ltd siemens ag danaher corporation thermo fisher scientific inc and pentair ltd 

competition in the applied water segment focuses on brand names application expertise product delivery and performance quality and price we compete by offering a wide variety of innovative and highquality products coupled with worldclass application expertise we believe our distribution through wellestablished channels and our reputation for quality significantly enhance our market position our ability to deliver innovative product offerings has allowed us to compete effectively to cultivate and maintain customer relationships and to serve and expand into many niche and new markets our key competitors within the applied water segment include grundfos wilo se pentair ltd franklin electric co inc and ksb inc 

research and development 

research and development “rd” is a key element of our engineering culture and is generally focused on the design and development of products and application knowhow that anticipate customer needs and emerging trends our engineers are involved in new product development and improvement of existing products our businesses invest substantial resources for rd we anticipate we will continue to develop and invest in our rd capabilities to promote a steady flow of innovative highquality and reliable products and applications to further strengthen our position in the markets we serve we invested 106 million  100 million  and 74 million  for the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively towards rd 

we have more than 600 engineering and research employees in more than 40 technology centers around the world rd activities are initially conducted in our technology centers located in conjunction with some of our major manufacturing facilities to ensure an efficient development process we have established a wastewater center of excellence in stockholm sweden with more than 100 research development and engineering employees we have launched centers of excellence in india and china where we are accelerating the customization of our application expertise to local needs in the scaleup process our rd activities are conducted at our piloting and testing facilities or at strategic customer sites these piloting and testing facilities enable us to serve our strategic markets in each region of the world 

we generally seek patent protection for those inventions and improvements that we believe will improve our competitive position we believe that our patents and applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and improving our return on research and development investments while we own control or license a significant number of patents trade secrets proprietary information trademarks trade names 

copyrights and other intellectual property rights which in the aggregate are of material importance to our business management believes that our business as a whole as well as each of our core business segments is not materially dependent on any one intellectual property right or related group of such rights 

patents patent applications and license agreements expire or terminate over time by operation of law in accordance with their terms or otherwise as the portfolio of our patents patent applications and license agreements has evolved over time we do not expect the expiration of any specific patent to have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

environmental matters and regulation 

our manufacturing operations worldwide are subject to many requirements under environmental laws in the united states the environmental protection agency and similar state agencies administer laws and regulations concerning air emissions water discharges waste disposal environmental remediation and other aspects of environmental protection such environmental laws and regulations in the united states include for example the federal clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act environmental requirements significantly affect our operations we have established an internal program to address compliance with applicable environmental requirements and as a result management believes that we are in substantial compliance with current environmental regulations 

while environmental laws and regulations are subject to change such changes can be difficult to predict reliably and the timing of potential changes is uncertain management does not believe based on current circumstances that compliance costs pursuant to such regulations will have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows however the effect of future legislative or regulatory changes could be material to our financial condition or results of operations 

accruals for environmental matters are recorded on a sitebysite basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on current law and existing technologies it can be difficult to estimate reliably the final costs of investigation and remediation due to various factors our accrued liabilities for these environmental matters represent the best estimates related to the investigation and remediation of environmental media such as water soil soil vapor air and structures as well as related legal fees based upon the facts and circumstances as currently known to us these estimates and related accruals are reviewed quarterly and updated for progress of investigation and remediation efforts and changes in facts and legal circumstances liabilities for these environmental expenditures are recorded on an undiscounted basis we do not anticipate these liabilities will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated and combined financial position results of operations or cash flows we cannot make assurances that other sites or new details about sites known to us that could give rise to environmental liabilities with such material adverse effects on us will not be identified in the future at december 31 2012  we had estimated and accrued 11 million  related to environmental matters 

employees 

as of december 31 2012  xylem had approximately 12700 employees worldwide we believe that our facilities are in favorable labor markets with ready access to adequate numbers of workers and we believe our relations with our employees are good

 item 1a risk factors 

each of the following risks should be carefully considered along with all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k we believe these risks to be the principal ones we face and of which we are currently aware some of the risks described below relate to our operations while others relate to residual risks from our separation from itt corporation in 2011 the spinoff other risks relate principally to the securities markets and ownership of our common stock 

should any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment 

risks related to our operations 

failure to compete successfully in our markets could adversely affect our business 

we provide products and services into competitive markets we believe the principal points of competition in our markets are product performance reliability and innovation application expertise brand reputation energy efficiency product life cycle cost timeliness of delivery proximity of service centers effectiveness of our distribution channels and price maintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment by us in manufacturing research and development engineering marketing customer service and support and our distribution networks we may not be successful in maintaining our competitive position our competitors may develop products that are superior to our products or may develop more efficient or effective methods of providing products and services or may adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies or evolving customer requirements pricing pressures also could cause us to adjust the prices of certain products to stay competitive we may not be able to compete successfully with our existing or new competitors failure to continue competing successfully could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

our business could be adversely affected by the inability of suppliers to meet delivery requirements 

our business relies on thirdparty suppliers contract manufacturing and commodity markets to secure raw materials parts and components used in our products parts and raw materials commonly used in our products include motors fabricated parts castings bearings seals nickel copper aluminum and plastics we are exposed to the availability of these materials which may be subject to curtailment or change due to among other things interruptions in production by suppliers labor disputes the impaired financial condition of a particular supplier suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels ability to meet regulatory requirements weather emergencies or acts of war or terrorism any delay in our suppliers’ abilities to provide us with necessary materials could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers and accordingly could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

our strategy includes acquisitions and we may not be able to make acquisitions of suitable candidates or integrate acquisitions successfully 

our historical growth has included acquisitions as part of our growth strategy we plan to pursue the acquisition of other companies assets and product lines that either complement or expand our existing business we cannot make assurances however that we will be able to identify suitable candidates successfully negotiate appropriate acquisition terms obtain financing that may be needed to consummate those acquisitions complete proposed acquisitions successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or expand into new markets in addition we cannot make assurances that any acquisition once successfully integrated will perform as planned be accretive to earnings or prove to be beneficial to our operations or cash flow 

acquisitions involve a number of risks and present financial managerial and operational challenges including diversion of management attention from existing businesses and operations integration of technology operations personnel and financial and other systems potentially insufficient internal controls over financial activities or financial reporting at an acquired entity that could impact us on a combined basis the failure to realize expected synergies the possibility that we have acquired substantial undisclosed liabilities and the loss of key employees of the acquired businesses 

our business could be adversely affected by inflation and other manufacturing and operating cost increases 

our operating costs are subject to fluctuations particularly due to changes in commodity prices raw materials energy and related utilities freight and cost of labor in order to remain competitive we may not be able to recuperate all or a portion of these higher costs from our customers through product price increases further our ability to realize financial benefits from six sigma and lean projects may not be able to mitigate fully or in part these manufacturing and operating cost increases and as a result could negatively impact our profitability 

our ability to successfully manage our restructuring and realignment actions could impact our business results 

we expect to incur approximately 60 to 70 million of restructuring and realignment costs in 2013 including costs related to the establishment of a european headquarters and management structure to better align xylem to serve our customers and address market opportunities as well as optimize our cost base successfully executing and managing these actions including establishing the most effective organizational structures and the retention of key employees is critical to achieving our expected cost savings as well as effectively competing in the marketplace other factors that may impede an effective restructuring and realignment include the impact of regulatory matters and adverse economic market conditions if this organizational redesign is not executed successfully the companys financial results could be adversely impacted 

changes in our effective tax rates may adversely affect our financial results 

we sell our products in more than 150 countries and approximately 63  of our revenue was generated outside the united states in 2012  given the global nature of our business a number of factors may increase our future effective tax rates including 

 any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could reduce net income for future periods 

product defects and unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure with respect to our products could adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements 

manufacturing or design defects in including in products or components that we source from third parties unanticipated use of or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of products that we make or sell can lead to personal injury death or property damage these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products result in the removal of a product from the market and result in product liability claims being brought against us recalls removals and product liability claims can result in significant costs as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products 

failure to comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act or other applicable anticorruption legislation could result in fines criminal penalties and an adverse effect on our business 

we operate in a number of countries throughout the world including countries considered to have a high risk of corruption we are committed to doing business in accordance with applicable anticorruption laws we are subject however to the risk that we or our affiliated entities or our representatives or their respective officers directors employees and agents may take action determined to be in violation of such anticorruption laws or regulations including the us foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 the uk bribery act of 2010 and others any such violation could result in substantial fines sanctions civil andor criminal penalties and curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions and might adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition in addition actual or alleged violations could damage our reputation and ability to do business furthermore detecting 

investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations is expensive and can consume significant time and attention of our senior management 

we may be negatively impacted by litigation and regulatory proceedings 

we are subject to laws regulations and potential liability relating to claims complaints and proceedings including those related to antitrust environmental product and other matters 

we are subject to various laws ordinances regulations and other requirements of government authorities in foreign countries and in the united states any violation of which could potentially create substantial liability for us and also damage to our reputation changes in laws ordinances regulations or other government policies the nature timing and effect of which are uncertain may significantly increase our expenses and liabilities 

from time to time we are involved in legal proceedings that are incidental to the operation of our businesses including acquisitions and divestitures some of these proceedings seek remedies relating to environmental matters intellectual property matters product liability and personal injury claims employment labor and pension matters and government and commercial or contract issues sometimes related to acquisitions or divestitures we may become subject to significant claims of which we are currently unaware or the claims of which we are aware may result in our incurring a significantly greater liability than we anticipate or can estimate additionally we may receive fines or penalties or be required to change or cease operations at one or more facilities if a regulatory agency determines that we have failed to comply with laws regulations or orders applicable to our business 

our business could be adversely affected by interruptions in information technology communications networks and operations 

our business operations rely on information technology and communications networks and operations that are vulnerable to damage or disturbance from a variety of sources regardless of protection measures essentially all systems are susceptible to disruption due to failure vandalism computer viruses security breaches natural disasters power outages and other events in addition cybersecurity threats are evolving and include among others malicious software attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in our systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data we also have a concentration of operations on certain sites eg production and shared services centers where business interruptions could cause material damage and costs transport of goods from suppliers and to customers could also be hampered for the reasons stated above although we continue to assess these risks implement controls and perform business continuity planning we cannot be sure that interruptions with material adverse effects will not occur 

risks related to liquidity 

our indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operational flexibility 

as of december 31 2012  our total outstanding indebtedness was 1205 million  including our 355 senior notes of 600 million aggregate principal amount due september 2016 and 4875 senior notes of 600 million aggregate principal amount due october 2021 we have an existing four year competitive advance and revolving credit facility the “credit facility” which provides for an aggregate principal amount of up to 600 million additionally effective december 14 2012 we entered into a risk sharing finance facility agreement the rd facility agreement with the european investment bank eib in an aggregate principal amount of up to €120 million  approximately 158 million  

our indebtedness could 

 18 

 in addition there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available to us on favorable terms or at all for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness if we incur additional debt or raise equity through the issuance of preferred stock the terms of the debt or preferred stock issued may give the holders rights preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock particularly in the event of liquidation the terms of the debt may also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on our operations than we currently have also regardless of the terms of our debt or equity financing the amount of our stock that we can issue may be limited because the issuance of our stock may cause the distribution to be a taxable event for itt under section 355e of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” and under the tax matters agreement entered into by itt in connection with the spinoff the “tax matters agreement” we could be required to indemnify itt for that tax 

our ability to make scheduled principal payments of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance which may be affected by factors beyond our control if we are unable to service our indebtedness our business financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 

risks related to external factors 

our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by global economic and financial market conditions 

we compete around the world in various geographic and product markets in 2012  37  and 35  of our total revenue was from customers located in the united states and europe respectively we expect revenue from these markets to be significant for the foreseeable future important factors impacting our businesses include the overall strength of these economies and our customers’ confidence in both local and global macroeconomic conditions industrial and federal state local and municipal governmental spending the strength of the residential and commercial real estate markets interest rates availability of commercial financing for our customers and endusers and unemployment rates a slowdown or downturn in these financial or macroeconomic conditions could have a significant adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

economic and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our business 

in 2012  63  of our total revenue was from customers outside the united states we expect our international operations and export sales to continue to be a significant portion of our revenue both our sales from international operations and export sales are subject in varying degrees to risks inherent to doing business outside the united states these risks include the following 

 any payment of distributions loans or advances to us by our foreign subsidiaries could be subject to restrictions on or taxation of dividends on repatriation of earnings under applicable local law monetary transfer restrictions and foreign currency exchange regulations in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate in addition to the general risks that we face outside the united states we now conduct more of our operations in emerging markets than we have in the past which could involve additional uncertainties for us including risks that governments may impose limitations on our ability to repatriate funds governments may impose withholding or other taxes on remittances and other payments to us or the amount of any such taxes may increase an outbreak or escalation of any insurrection or armed conflict may occur governments may seek to nationalize our assets or governments may impose or increase investment barriers or other restrictions affecting our business in addition emerging 

markets pose other uncertainties including the protection of our intellectual property and other assets pressure on the pricing of our products and risks of political instability we cannot predict the impact such future largely unforeseeable events might have on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

our business could be adversely affected by significant movements in foreign currency exchange rates 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly with respect to the euro swedish krona british pound australian dollar canadian dollar polish zloty and hungarian forint any significant change in the value of currencies of the countries in which we do business relative to the value of the us dollar or euro could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

weather conditions may adversely affect our financial results 

weather conditions particularly heavy flooding and droughts can positively or negatively impact portions of our business within the dewatering space our pumps provided through our godwin brand are used to remove excess or unwanted water heavy flooding due to weather conditions drives increased demand for these applications on the other hand drought conditions drive higher demand for pumps used in agricultural and turf irrigation applications such as those provided by our goulds water technology flowtronex and lowara brands given the unpredictable nature of weather conditions this may result in volatility for certain portions of our business as well as the operations of certain of our customers and suppliers 

the level of returns on postretirement benefit plan assets changes in interest rates and other factors could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods 

certain members of our current and retired employee population are covered by pension and other employeerelated defined benefit plans collectively postretirement benefit plans we may experience significant fluctuations in costs related to our postretirement benefit plans as a result of macroeconomic factors such as interest rates that are beyond our control the cost of our postretirement plans is incurred over long periods of time and involves factors and uncertainties during those periods which can be volatile and unpredictable including rates of return on postretirement benefit plan assets discount rates used to calculate liabilities and expenses and rates of future compensation increases management develops each assumption using relevant plan and company experience and expectations in conjunction with marketrelated data our liquidity financial position including shareholders’ equity and results of operations could be materially affected by significant changes in key economic indicators actuarial experience financial market volatility future legislation and other governmental regulatory actions 

we make contributions to fund our postretirement benefit plans when considered necessary or advantageous to do so the macroeconomic factors discussed above including the return on postretirement benefit plan assets and the minimum funding requirements established by local government funding or taxing authorities or established by other agreement may influence future funding requirements a significant decline in the fair value of our plan assets or other adverse changes to our overall pension and other employeerelated benefit plans could require us to make significant funding contributions and affect cash flows in future periods 

unforeseen environmental issues could impact our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our operations are subject to and affected by many federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations in addition we could be affected by future environmental laws or regulations including for example those imposed in response to climate change concerns compliance with current and future environmental laws and regulations currently requires and is expected to continue to require operating and capital expenditures 

environmental laws and regulations may authorize substantial fines and criminal sanctions as well as facility shutdowns to address violations and may require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit emissions or discharges we also incur and expect to continue to incur costs to comply with current environmental laws and regulations 

developments such as the adoption of new environmental laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations violations by us of such laws and regulations discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination litigation involving environmental impacts our inability to recover costs associated with any such developments or financial insolvency of other responsible parties could in the future have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

risks relating to our common stock 

the following are risks in connection with ownership of our common stock 

there is a limited market history for our common stock and the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly 

we cannot predict the prices at which our common stock may trade the market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely depending on many factors some of which may be beyond our control including 

 stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

we cannot make assurances that we will pay dividends on our common stock and our indebtedness could limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock 

the timing declaration amount and payment of future dividends to our shareholders fall within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on many factors including our financial condition results of operations and capital requirements as well as applicable law regulatory constraints industry practice and other business considerations that our board of directors considers relevant there can be no assurance that we will pay a dividend in the future or continue to pay dividends 

additionally if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our debtpayment obligations then our ability to pay dividends if so determined by the board of directors will be impaired and we may be required to attempt to restructure or refinance our debt raise additional capital or take other actions such as selling assets reducing or delaying capital expenditures or reducing our dividend there can be no assurance however that any such actions could be effected on satisfactory terms if at all or would be permitted by the terms of our debt or our other credit and contractual arrangements 

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents and indiana law could delay or prevent a change in control 

certain provisions of our amended and restated articles of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may delay or prevent a merger or acquisition part or all of our business operations for example the amended and 

restated articles of incorporation and the amended and restated bylaws among other things provide for a classified board of directors and require advance notice for shareholder proposals and nominations do not permit shareholders to convene special meetings and do not permit action by written consent of the shareholders in addition the amended and restated articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock these provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals of our business operations or delay or prevent a change in control which could harm our stock price indiana law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 10 or more of our outstanding common stock and us as well as certain restrictions on the voting rights of “control shares” of an “issuing public corporation” 

under the tax matters agreement we have agreed not to enter into any transaction involving an acquisition including issuance of xylem common stock or any other transaction or to the extent we have the right to prohibit it to permit any such transaction that could cause the spinoff to be taxable to itt we have also agreed to indemnify itt for any tax resulting from any such transactions generally itt will recognize taxable gain on the spinoff if there are one or more acquisitions including issuances of our capital stock directly or indirectly representing 50 or more measured by vote or value of our thenoutstanding capital stock and the acquisitions or issuances are deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the spinoff any such shares of our common stock acquired directly or indirectly within two years before or after the spinoff with exceptions including public trading by lessthan5 shareholders and certain compensatory stock issuances will generally be presumed to be part of such a plan unless that presumption is rebutted as a result our obligations may discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company 

risks related to our 2011 separation from itt corporation 

if the spinoff were to fail to qualify as a taxfree transaction under the internal revenue code then we andor our former parent and our stockholders could be subject to significant tax liability 

in connection with the spinoff we and our former parent itt corporation received an irs ruling the “irs ruling” stating that itt and its shareholders will not recognize any taxable income gain or loss for us federal income tax purposes as a result of the spinoff in addition itt received an opinion of tax counsel as to the satisfaction of certain requirements necessary for the spinoff to receive taxfree treatment upon which the irs did not rule the irs ruling while generally binding upon the irs was based on certain factual statements and representations if any such factual statements or representations were incomplete or untrue in any material respect or if the facts on which the irs ruling were based were materially different from the facts at the time of the spinoff the irs could modify or revoke the irs ruling retroactively 

as discussed above certain requirements for taxfree treatment that are not covered in the irs ruling were addressed in the opinion of counsel the opinion of counsel is not binding on the irs accordingly the irs may reach conclusions with respect to the spinoff that are different from the conclusions reached in the opinion like the irs ruling the opinion was based on certain factual statements and representations which if incomplete or untrue in any material respect could alter counsel’s conclusions 

if all or a portion of the spinoff does not qualify as a taxfree transaction because any of the factual statements or representations in the irs ruling or the legal opinion are incomplete or untrue or because the facts upon which the irs ruling is based were materially different from the facts at the time of the spinoff itt would recognize a substantial gain for us federal income tax purposes in such case under us treasury regulations each member of the itt consolidated group at the time of the spinoff including us and our subsidiaries would be jointly and severally liable for the entire amount of any resulting us federal income tax liability 

notwithstanding the foregoing the spinoff will be taxable to itt but not to itt shareholders pursuant to section 355e of the internal revenue code if there are one or more acquisitions including issuances of the stock of either us or itt representing 50 or more measured by vote or value of the thenoutstanding stock of either corporation and the acquisition or acquisitions are deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the spinoff any acquisition of our common stock within two years before or after the spinoff with exceptions including public trading by lessthan5 shareholders and certain compensatory stock issuances generally will be presumed to be part of such a plan unless that presumption is rebutted the tax liability resulting from the application of section 355e would be substantial in addition under us treasury regulations each member of the itt consolidated group at the time of the spinoff including us and our subsidiaries would be severally liable for the resulting us federal income tax liability 

we have agreed not to enter into any transaction that could cause any portion of the spinoff to be taxable to itt including under section 355e pursuant to the tax matters agreement dated as of october 25 2011 among itt 

exelis and xylem we have also agreed to indemnify itt and exelis for any tax liabilities resulting from such transactions and itt and exelis have agreed to indemnify us for any tax liabilities resulting from such transactions entered into by itt or exelis these obligations may discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company 

we may be unable to achieve all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from the spinoff 

as an independent publicly traded company we believe that our business will benefit from among other things i greater strategic focus of financial resources and management’s efforts ii enhanced customer focus iii direct and differentiated access to capital resources iv enhanced investor choices by offering investment opportunities in a separate entity from itt v improved management incentive tools and vi utilization of stock as an acquisition currency however as a result of separating from itt we may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than we would have been as a part of itt in addition we may not be able to achieve all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as an independent company in the time we expect if at all 

we have a limited operating history as an independent company and our historical financial information may not be a reliable indicator of our future results 

certain historical financial information we have included in this annual report has been prepared on a “carveout” basis from itt’s consolidated financial statements and does not necessarily reflect what our financial position and results of operations would have been as a separate standalone entity during the periods presented itt did not account for us and we were not operated as a single standalone entity or segment for all the periods presented in addition the historical information is not necessarily indicative of what our results of operations and financial position will be in the future while we were profitable as part of itt we cannot assume that as a standalone company our profits will continue at a similar level 

the spinoff may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal distribution requirements 

the spinoff could be challenged under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws an unpaid creditor or an entity vested with the power of such creditor such as a trustee or debtorinpossession in a bankruptcy could claim that the spinoff left us itt andor exelis insolvent or with unreasonably small capital or that we itt andor exelis intended or believed it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay as they mature and that itt did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value in the spinoff if a court were to agree with such a plaintiff then such court could void the spinoff as a fraudulent transfer and could impose a number of different remedies which could adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations among other things the court could require the return of assets or our shares to itt voiding the liens of xylem and claims against itt or providing itt with a claim for money damages against us 

the measure of insolvency for purposes of the fraudulent conveyance laws will vary depending on which jurisdiction’s law is applied generally however an entity would be considered insolvent if either the fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount of its liabilities including the probable amount of contingent liabilities or it is unlikely to be able to pay its liabilities as they become due no assurance can be given as to what standard a court would apply to determine insolvency or that a court would determine that we itt or exelis were solvent at the time of or after giving effect to the spinoff 

the spinoff could also be challenged under state corporate distribution statutes under the indiana business corporation law a corporation may not make distributions to its shareholders if after giving effect to the distribution i the corporation would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business or ii the corporation’s total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities no assurance can be given that a court will not later determine that the distribution of our shares in connection with the spinoff was unlawful 

under the distribution agreement from and after the spinoff we will be responsible for the debts liabilities and other obligations related to the business or businesses which we own and operate following the consummation of the spinoff although we do not expect to be liable for any of these or other obligations not expressly assumed by us pursuant to the distribution agreement it is possible that we could be required to assume responsibility for certain obligations retained by itt or exelis should itt or exelis fail to pay or perform its retained obligations for example tax asbestos andor environmental liabilities 

in connection with our separation itt and exelis will indemnify us for certain liabilities and we will indemnify itt or exelis for certain liabilities if we are required to indemnify itt or exelis we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations and our financial results could be negatively impacted in the case of itt’s or exelis’s indemnity there can be no assurance that those indemnities will be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of such liabilities or as to itt’s or exelis’s ability to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future 

pursuant to the distribution agreement and certain other agreements with itt and exelis itt and exelis agreed to indemnify us from certain liabilities and we agreed to indemnify itt and exelis for certain liabilities indemnities that we may be required to provide itt and exelis may be significant and could negatively impact our business particularly indemnities relating to our actions that could impact the taxfree nature of the spinoff third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that itt or exelis has agreed to retain further there can be no assurance that the indemnities from itt and exelis will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities or that itt and exelis will be able to fully satisfy their indemnification obligations moreover even if we ultimately were to succeed in recovering from itt and exelis any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves each of these risks could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition

2013 business outlook 

throughout 2012 the company was faced with challenging market conditions with the volatile global economic environment especially in europe as well as dry weather conditions in north america we expect these conditions to begin to stabilize in 2013 and are projecting lowsingle digit revenue growth for the year as the end markets start to improve on a geographic basis while we expect modest improvement in the us economy and reacceleration in emerging markets growth we believe that europe will continue to be challenged in light of our projected modest revenue growth we will continue to focus on optimizing our cost structure as well as improving our operational efficiency and effectiveness resulting in our beginning to implement restructuring and realignment actions primarily in europe in 2013 we expect to incur approximately 40 to 50 million in restructuring costs and approximately 20 million in realignment costs to reposition our european business as well as other targeted actions to better positioning us for the future we anticipate approximately 13 to 15 million of net savings to be realized in 2013 from these actions 

additionally we currently generate approximately twothirds of our revenue outside the united states which is impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates particularly the euro swedish krona british pound australian dollar canadian dollar polish zloty and hungarian forint upon consolidation as exchange rates vary our revenue and other operating results may differ from expectations in this uncertain economy significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may continue

2012 versus 2011 

revenue 

revenue generated for 2012  was 3791 million  a decrease of 12 million  or 03  compared to 3803 million  in 2011  on a constant currency basis revenue grew 25  the following table illustrates the impact from organic growth recent acquisitions and fluctuations in foreign currency in relation to revenue during the annual 2012  period 



a foreign currency impact primarily due to fluctuations of the euro against the us dollar 

the following table summarizes revenue by segment for 2012  and 2011  



water infrastructure 

water infrastructure’s revenue increased 9 million  or 04  in 2012   37  on a constant currency basis including incremental revenue of 94 million  from acquisitions consisting of ysi in 2011 and mjk and heartland in 2012 the acquisitions of ysi and mjk contributed 90 million of the incremental revenue as we continued our expansion in the analytical instrumentation market 

organic revenue decreased 6 million  or 02  during the year which was primarily attributable to weakness in the transport and treatment markets as well as sustained drought conditions within the united states transport and treatment decreased mostly due to a decline in the public utility sector of developed markets caused by a weak capital project environment and delays on shipments these declines were partially offset by strength in emerging markets specifically in the latin america and asia pacific regions the results also reflect decreases in the dewatering rental and equipment sales as a result of the unfavorable dry weather conditions within north america and lower coal and gas prices offset slightly by a benefit from super storm sandy overall growth was also muted by continued weakness in europe as a result of challenging economic conditions 

foreign currency translation was favorable by 80 million  for 2012  as compared to 2011  

applied water 

applied water’s revenue decreased 20 million  or 14  in 2012  a 08  increase on a constant currency basis the growth on a constant currency basis was driven by organic revenue growth 

organic revenue grew 9 million  or 06  for the year and was principally due to strength in the industrial water sector from a favorable general industrial market across most regions especially within the united states russia and asia pacific markets the residential and commercial pumps business increased slightly due to favorable growth in the united states but was mostly eclipsed by declines from the weak economic conditions in europe the warm dry weather conditions in north america also drove an increase in the agriculture end market for the year 

foreign currency translation was favorable by 32 million  for 2012  as compared to 2011  

ordersbacklog 

orders received during 2012  decreased by 65 million  or 17  to  3782 million  a 13  increase on a constant currency basis these amounts include a benefit of 95 million  from acquisitions organic order decline was 46 million  for the year 

the water infrastructure segment orders decreased 33 million  or 13  to 2421 million   22  growth on a constant currency basis including 95 million  from acquisitions organic order volume decreased primarily due to the delays in public utility capital expenditure orders coupled with reduced dewatering volumes from dry weather conditions and slowdowns in the oil gas and mining markets orders declined in our applied water segment 29 million  or 20  to 1423 million   01  growth on a constant currency basis driven by declining organic orders of 04  the decline in organic order volume is primarily a result of the warm winter weather conditions in the united states and asia pacific markets impacting the building services end markets partially offset by strength in the industrial and agriculture markets 

delivery schedules vary from customer to customer based upon their requirements typically large projects require longer lead production cycles and delays can occur from time to time total backlog was 647 million  at december 31 2012  and 651 million  at december 31 2011  we anticipate that approximately 90 of the backlog at december 31 2012  will be recognized as revenue during 2013  

gross margin 

gross margins as a percentage of consolidated revenue increased to 396  in 2012  from 384  in 2011  the increase is attributable to benefits from price realization initiatives and cost improvements offset in part by an unfavorable sales mix and inflation 

operating expenses 



selling general and administrative expenses 

sga increased by 37 million  or 42  to 914 million  or 241  of revenue in 2012  as compared to 877 million  or 231  of revenue in 2011  the increase in sga expenses is principally due to the impact of incremental costs as a standalone company and costs related to the mjk and heartland acquisitions 

additionally in 2012 we incurred 7 million  of realignment costs relating to realigning our european businesses to improve our operational efficiencies 

research and development expenses 

rd spending increased 6 million  or 60  to 106 million  or 28  of revenue for 2012  as compared to 100 million  or 26  of revenue in 2011  these increases were primarily due to the impact from recent acquisitions as well as costs associated with the launching of new products 

restructuring and asset impairment charges 

during 2012 we incurred restructuring costs of 17 million  primarily related to restructuringrelated severance payments for reductions in force initiatives primarily within our water infrastructure segment during 2011 we incurred a 2 million  charge related to the impairment of a facility in our applied water segment as of december 31 2012 we consider those restructuring initiatives commenced to date to be substantially completed with a remaining liability of 9 million  related to the 2012 restructuring actions 

we estimate annual future net savings beginning in 2013 from our 2012 restructuring actions will be approximately 12 to 13 million  

separation costs 

we had nonrecurring pretax separation costs of 22 million  and 87 million  or 16 million  and 72 million  after tax during 2012  and 2011  respectively the components of separation costs incurred during these periods are presented below 



 

operating income 

we generated operating income of 443 million  during 2012  a 122  increase from the prior year primarily reflecting the benefits achieved from cost reductions and price improvements offset in part by an unfavorable sales mix acquisition costs and nonrecurring separation costs the following table illustrates operating income results by business segments for 2012  and 2011  



the table included below provides a reconciliation from segment operating income to adjusted operating income and a calculation of the corresponding adjusted operating margin 



 water infrastructure 

operating income for our water infrastructure segment decreased 1 million  or 03  increased 6 million  or 17  excluding separation restructuring and realignment costs compared with the prior year the 17  increase was predominately driven by incremental operating income of 20 million from the acquisitions of ysi mjk and heartland combined with price realization efforts and operating cost reductions these benefits were largely offset by inflation costs on labor and material as well as unfavorable mix from lower dewatering revenues and higher sales in emerging markets 

applied water 

operating income for our applied water segment increased 10 million  or 63   4 million  or 23  excluding separation restructuring and realignment costs compared to the prior year the 23  increase is primarily attributable to operating cost reductions put in place by the company and savings achieved from restructuring actions in the latter part of 2011 the increases were offset in part by lower sales volume an unfavorable sales mix and inflationary pressures on labor and materials 

interest expense 

interest expense was 55 million  and 17 million  for 2012 and 2011 respectively the increase during the current year reflected a full year of interest expense related to the issuance of 12 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes issued in september 2011 refer to note 14 “credit facilities and longterm debt” for further details 

income tax expense 

the income tax provision for 2012  was 91 million  at an effective tax rate of 234  compared to 104 million  at an effective tax rate of 274  in 2011  the 2012  effective tax rate is lower than 2011  as a result of the decrease in nondeductible separation costs and a change in the mix of earnings 

effective january 1 2013 the swedish government enacted legislation that will increase the effective tax rate of the company the company is currently implementing strategies to address the impact of this legislation 

2011 versus 2010

water infrastructure 

water infrastructure’s revenue increased 486 million or 252 in 2011 including incremental revenue of 264 million from acquisitions including godwin and nova in 2010 and ysi in september 2011 our 2011 acquisition of ysi contributed 35 million and continued our expansion in the analytical instrumentation market 

organic revenue growth of 137 million or 71 during the year was primarily attributable to transport and treatment applications transport increased due to dewatering equipment volume from both the public utility and industrial sectors the results also reflect increased public utility investment in treatment projects in latin america and the middle east overall growth was partially offset by decreased volume in southern europe which continues to present challenging economic conditions 

foreign currency translation was favorable by 87 million for the annual period ended december 31 2011 as compared to 2010 

applied water 

applied water’s revenue increased 117 million or 88 in 2011 driven by organic revenue growth of 88 million or 66 the organic revenue growth reflects gains across all regions lead by doubledigit growth rates in eastern europe latin america china and the middle east primarily due to increased volume in light industrial and building service applications as a result of new products such as esv a highefficiency vertical multistage pump and increased volume in the irrigation applications as a result of favorable weather conditions in the united states pricing initiatives executed throughout the period also contributed to the revenue growth 

foreign currency translation was favorable by 28 million for 2011 as compared to 2010 

ordersbacklog 

orders received during 2011 increased by 610 million or 188 to 3847 million including benefits of 272 million from acquisitions and 120 million from foreign currency translation adjustments organic order growth was 67 for the year the water infrastructure segment generated order growth of 513 million or 264 to 2454 million including 272 million and 96 million from acquisitions and favorable foreign currency respectively order 

growth in our applied water segment was 100 million or 74 to 1452 million driven by 53 organic order growth and 27 million of favorable foreign currency translation due to increased activity in the light industrial agriculture and heat transfer markets 

delivery schedules vary from customer to customer based upon their requirements typically large projects require longer lead production cycles and delays can occur from time to time total backlog was 651 million at december 31 2011 and 620 million at december 31 2010 we anticipate that in excess of 80 of the backlog at december 31 2011 will be recognized as revenue during 2012 

gross margin 

gross margins as a percentage of consolidated revenue increased to 384 in 2011 from 379 in 2010 the increase is attributable to benefits from productivity and price realization initiatives offset in part by rising commodity costs and higher labor and overhead costs due to increased spending related to additional volume 

operating expenses excluding separation costs 



selling general and administrative expenses 

sga increased by 140 million to 877 million or 231 of revenue in 2011 as compared to 737 million or 230 of revenue in 2010 the increase in sga expenses is principally due to sales volume related increases in selling marketing and distribution expenses including the impact of recent acquisitions 

research and development expenses 

rd spending increased 26 million to 100 million or 26 of revenue for 2011 as compared to 74 million or 23 of revenue in 2010 these increases were primarily due to 11 million incremental expense from recent acquisitions and programs as we continued to invest in new product developments 

restructuring and asset impairment charges 

during 2011 we incurred a 2 million charge related to the impairment of a facility in our applied water segment during 2010 we recognized restructuring charges totaling 15 million as part of an initiative to improve effectiveness and efficiency of operations as of december 31 2011 we considered these restructuring initiatives to be substantially completed with a remaining liability of 1 million 

separation costs 

we had nonrecurring pretax separation costs of 87 million or 72 million after tax during 2011 the components of separation costs incurred during these periods are presented below in millions 



 

operating income 

we generated operating income of 395 million during 2011 a 18 increase from the prior year primarily reflecting increased revenues offset in part by nonrecurring separation costs of 87 million the following table illustrates operating income results by business segments for 2011 and 2010 



the table included below provides a reconciliation from segment operating income to adjusted operating income and a calculation of the corresponding adjusted operating margin 



 water infrastructure 

operating income for our water infrastructure segment increased 67 million or 243 71 million or 247 excluding separation and restructuring costs compared with the prior year this increase is led by incremental operating income of 42 million from acquisitions over the same period also contributing to the increase were higher sales volumes lower restructuring expense and benefits from productivity and material costs savings initiatives partially offset by higher labor and overhead costs material inflation and unfavorable mix 

applied water 

operating income for our applied water segment increased 2 million or 13 12 million or 75 excluding separation and restructuring costs compared to the prior year as higher sales volume and price realization were partially offset by increased spend on research and development and the unfavorable impacts of inflation and customer and product mix 

interest expense 

interest expense increased to 17 million in 2011 primarily reflecting interest related to the issuance of 12 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes issued in september 2011 refer to note 14 “credit facilities and longterm debt” for further details 

income tax expense 

the income tax provision for 2011 was 104 million at an effective tax rate of 274 compared to 59 million at an effective tax rate of 152 in 2010 the 2011 effective tax rate is higher than 2010 as a result of the unfavorable impact of recording a deferred tax liability on the excess of financial reporting over the tax basis of investments in certain foreign subsidiaries that has not been permanently reinvested non deductible separation costs and an increase in valuation allowances on certain foreign losses offset in part by tax examination settlements and increased tax exempt interest 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash 



sources and uses of liquidity 

operating activities 

during 2012  net cash provided by operating activities was 396 million  compared to 449 million  in 2011  the 53 million  yearoveryear decrease is primarily the result of interest payments on debt of 53 million in 2012 higher tax payments of 40 million and additional contributions to postretirement benefit plans partially offset by an increase in receivable collections and a decline in payments for separation costs 

during 2011  net cash provided by operating activities was 449 million  compared to 395 million  in 2010  the 54 million  yearoveryear increase is primarily the result of lower tax and restructuring payments this increase was partially offset by net increased uses of cash in working capital driven by spending to support increased sales volumes 

investing activities 

cash used in investing activities was 147 million  for 2012  compared to 423 million  in 2011  and 1093 million  in 2010  the changes in investing activities are driven almost entirely by cash used for acquisitions and to a lesser extent from changes in spending on capital expenditures we invested 41 million for the acquisitions of mjk and heartland during 2012 while 309 million was used in 2011 for the acquisition of ysi in 2011 and 1004 million in 2010 predominately related to the acquisitions of nova 385 million and godwin pumps 580 million capital expenditures for 2012 of 112 million  were 14 million less than in 2011 primarily due to a reduction in dewatering asset purchases to align with current rental demand in 2011 we spent 126 million  on capital expenditures an increase of 32 million over 2010 primarily due to investments to increase productivity and the expansion of the godwin business 

financing activities 

during 2012  cash used by financing activities was 74 million  compared to cash provided by financing activities of 172 million  and 745 million in 2011  and 2010  respectively cash used for financing activities during 2012 was driven by dividend payments of 75 million  and share repurchases of 13 million  partially offset by 24 million  of proceeds from the exercise of stock options for 2011 net proceeds from the issuance of 12 billion in senior notes funded a net cash transfer of 1 billion to our former parent itt which included the repayment of funds used in the acquisition of ysi in general the components of net transfers include i cash transfers from the company to parent ii cash investments from our parent used to fund operations capital expenditures and acquisitions iii charges benefits for income taxes and iv allocations of the parent company’s corporate expenses described in this report 

funding and liquidity strategy 

as a result of the spinoff our capital structure and sources of liquidity changed significantly our ability to fund our capital needs depends on our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access to the bank and capital markets 

our global funding requirements are continually monitored with appropriate strategies executed to ensure liquidity needs are met cost effectively based on our current global cash positions cash flows for operations and access to the commercial paper markets we believe there is sufficient liquidity to meet our funding requirements in 

addition our existing committed credit facilities and access to the public debt markets would provide further liquidity if required 

historically we have generated operating cash flow sufficient to fund our primary cash needs centered on operating activities working capital capital expenditures and strategic investments if our cash flows from operations are less than we expect we may need to incur debt or issue equity from time to time we may need to access the longterm and shortterm capital markets to obtain financing our access to and the availability of financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors including i our credit ratings or absence of a credit rating ii the liquidity of the overall capital markets and iii the current state of the economy there can be no assurance that we will continue to have access to the capital markets on terms acceptable to us we cannot assure that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or that such financing will be available at all 

we anticipate that our present sources of funds including funds from operations will provide us with sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet our liquidity and capital needs in both the united states and outside of the united states over the next twelve months 

senior notes 

on september 20 2011 we issued 3550 senior notes of 600 million aggregate principal amount due september 2016 the “senior notes due 2016” and 4875 senior notes of 600 million aggregate principal amount due october 2021 the “senior notes due 2021” and together with the senior notes due 2016 the “senior notes” 

the issuance resulted in gross proceeds of 12 billion offset by 9 million in debt issuance costs which were capitalized and are included within other assets the senior notes include covenants which restrict our ability subject to exceptions to incur debt secured by liens and engage in sale and leaseback transactions as well as provide for customary events of default subject in certain cases to receipt of notice of default andor customary grace and cure periods including but not limited to i failure to pay interest for 30 days ii failure to pay principal when due iii failure to perform any other covenant for 90 days after receipt of notice from the trustee or from holders of 25 of the outstanding principal amount and iv certain events of bankruptcy insolvency or reorganization we may redeem the senior notes as applicable in whole or in part at any time at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the senior notes to be redeemed plus a makewhole premium as of december 31 2012  we were in compliance with all covenants if a change of control of xylem triggering event occurs we will be required to make an offer to purchase the senior notes at a price equal to 101 of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase

nonus operations 

for 2012  and 2011  we generated approximately 63  and 64  respectively of our revenue from nonus operations as we continue to grow our operations in the emerging markets and elsewhere outside of the united states we expect to continue to generate significant revenue from nonus operations and we expect our cash will be predominately held by our foreign subsidiaries we expect to manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed we may transfer cash from certain international subsidiaries to the us and other international subsidiaries when it is cost effective to do so our intent is to indefinitely reinvest all but 100 million of these funds outside of the united states however we continually review our domestic and foreign cash profile expected future cash generation and investment opportunities that support our current designation of these funds as being indefinitely reinvested and reassess whether there is a demonstrated need to repatriate funds held internationally to support our us operations if as a result of our review it is determined that all or a portion of the funds may be needed for our operations in the united states we would be required to accrue us taxes related to future tax payments associated with the repatriation of these funds as of december 31 2012  our foreign subsidiaries were holding 401 million  in cash or marketable securities 

as of december 31 2012 our excess of financial reporting over the tax basis of investments in certain foreign subsidiaries totaled 17 billion  we have not asserted that 100 million of our excess basis difference will be indefinitely reinvested and have therefore provided for united states or additional foreign withholding taxes for that portion generally such amounts become subject to us taxation upon the remittance of dividends and under certain other circumstances 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual commitments as of december 31 2012  



in addition to the amounts presented in the table above we have recorded liabilities for uncertain tax positions of 8 million  these amounts have been excluded from the contractual obligations table due to an inability to reasonably estimate the timing of such payments in individual years further benefit payments which reflect expected future service related to the companys pension and other postretirement employee benefit obligations are presented in note 15 “postretirement benefit plans” and not included in the above table 

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2012  we have issued guarantees for the debt and other obligations of consolidated subsidiaries we do not consider the maximum exposure to be material either individually or in the aggregate 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 

significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated and combined financial statements are discussed in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” in the notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they are inherently uncertain involve significant judgments include areas where different estimates reasonably could have been used and changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable however actual results in these areas could differ from management’s estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

revenue recognition  we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured for product sales delivery does not occur until the products have been shipped risk of loss has been transferred to the customer and the contractual terms have been fulfilled in instances where contractual terms include a provision for customer acceptance revenue is recognized when either i we have previously demonstrated that the product meets the specified criteria based on either seller or customerspecified objective criteria or ii upon formal acceptance received from the customer where the product has not been previously demonstrated to meet customerspecified objective criteria revenue on service and repair contracts is recognized after services have been agreed to by the customer and rendered 

we enter into contracts to sell our products and services and while the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions certain agreements contain multiple elements or nonstandard terms and conditions where sales agreements contain multiple elements or nonstandard terms and conditions judgment is required to determine the appropriate accounting including whether the deliverables specified in these agreements should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes and if so how the transaction price should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize revenue for each element when a sale involves multiple deliverables the total revenue from the arrangement is allocated to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price of the deliverable to all other deliverables in the contract revenue for multiple element arrangements is recognized when the appropriate revenue recognition criteria for the individual deliverable have been satisfied the allocation of sales price between elements may impact the timing of revenue recognition but will not change the total revenue recognized on the arrangement for delivered elements accounted for as separate units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement revenue is recognized only when the delivered elements have standalone value there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance and there are no customernegotiated refund or return rights affecting the sales recognized 

we record a reduction in revenue at the time of sale for estimated product returns rebates and other allowances based on historical experience and known trends 

warranty accrual  accruals for estimated expenses related to warranties are made at the time products are sold or services are rendered and are recorded as a component of cost of revenue these accruals are established using historical information on the nature frequency and average cost of warranty claims and consider any factors that may cause differences in expected future warranty costs as compared to historical claim experience while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes we base our estimated warranty obligation on product warranty terms offered to customers ongoing product failure rates material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure as well as specific product class failures outside of our baseline experience we assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities quarterly and adjust amounts as necessary 

income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities applying enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences will reverse based on the evaluation of available evidence we recognize future tax benefits such as net operating loss carryforwards to the extent that we believe it is more likely than not we will realize these benefits we periodically assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets and reflect any changes to our estimate of the amount we are more likely than not to realize in the valuation allowance with a corresponding adjustment to earnings or other comprehensive income as appropriate 

in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we look to the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences taxable income in carryback years and the feasibility of tax planning strategies and estimated future taxable income the valuation allowance can be affected by changes to tax laws changes to statutory tax rates and changes to future taxable income estimates 

our effective tax rate reflects the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which we have not provided us taxes because we plan to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside the united states we plan foreign earnings remittance amounts based on projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and longterm investment requirements of our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic operations based on these assumptions we estimate the amount we will distribute to the united states and provide the us federal taxes due on these amounts material changes in our estimates of cash working capital and longterm investment requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we do business could impact our effective tax rate 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and to the extent to which additional taxes will be due furthermore we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

we adjust our liability for uncertain tax positions in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional tax expense would result if a payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 

goodwill and intangible assets  we review goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable we also review the carrying value of our finitelived intangible assets for potential impairment when impairment indicators arise we conduct our annual impairment test as of the first day of the fourth quarter we perform a twostep impairment test for goodwill in the first step we compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds its fair value then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to measure the impairment loss to be recorded if any if the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value then we record an impairment loss equal to the difference in our annual impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets we compare the fair value of those assets to their carrying value we recognize an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying value we estimate the fair value of our reporting units and intangible assets with indefinite lives using an income approach under the income approach we calculate fair value based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinitelived intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions particularly related to future operating results and cash flows these estimates and assumptions include but are not limited to revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates assumed royalty rates future economic and market conditions and identification of appropriate market comparable data in addition the identification of reporting units and the allocation of assets and liabilities to the reporting units when determining the carrying value of each reporting unit also require judgment goodwill is tested for impairment at either the operating segment identified in note 20 “industry segment and geographic data” of the consolidated and combined financial statements or one level below the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets is based on estimates and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable significant changes to these estimates and assumptions could adversely impact our conclusions actual future results may differ from those estimates 

our 2012  annual goodwill impairment analysis indicated the estimated fair value of our reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying value and accordingly no impairment charges were recorded in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value estimates on the goodwill impairment test we applied a hypothetical 100 basis point increase to the discount rates utilized a ten percent reduction in expected future cash flows and reduced the assumed future growth rates of each reporting unit by 100 basis points these hypothetical changes did not result in any reporting unit failing step one of the impairment test further our 2012  annual indefinitelived intangible asset impairment test did not result in an impairment charge as the estimated fair value of the assets exceeded their carrying value 

postretirement plans  prior to the spinoff employees who met certain eligibility requirements participated in various retirement plans administered by itt in connection with the spinoff we entered into a benefit and compensation matters agreement with itt whereby xylem agreed to adopt or assume sponsorship of certain defined benefit plans and replicate certain itt defined contribution plans to allow for continuation of those benefits under this agreement assets and liabilities attributable to xylem employees were transferred from itt to our qualified defined benefit and defined contribution plans 

company employees around the world participate in numerous defined benefit pension plans the determination of projected benefit obligations and the recognition of expenses related to these pension plans are dependent on various assumptions these major assumptions primarily relate to discount rates expected longterm rates of return on plan assets rate of future compensation increases mortality health care inflation and termination some of which are disclosed in note 15 “postretirement benefit plans” in the notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements and other factors actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and are amortized generally over the estimated future working life of the plan participants or for plans with all or substantially all inactive participants over the average remaining life expectancy 

significant assumptions 

management develops each assumption using relevant company experience in conjunction with marketrelated data for each individual country in which such plans exist all assumptions are reviewed annually with thirdparty consultants and adjusted as necessary the table included below provides the weighted average assumptions used to estimate our defined benefit pension obligations and costs as of and for the years 2012  and 2011  



we determine the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets by evaluating both historical returns and estimates of future returns specifically the company analyzes the estimated future returns based on independent estimates of asset class returns and evaluates historical broad market returns over longterm timeframes based on the strategic asset allocation which is detailed in note 15 “postretirement benefit plans” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

based on the approach described above the chart below shows weighted average actual returns versus the weighted average expected longterm rates of return for our pension plans that were utilized in the calculation of the net periodic pension cost for each respective year 



 for the recognition of net periodic pension cost the calculation of the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is generally derived using a marketrelated value of plan assets based on average asset values at the measurement date over the last five years the use of fair value rather than a calculated value could materially affect net periodic pension cost our weighted average expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for all pension plans effective january 1 2013  is 740  we estimate that every 25 basis point change in the expected return on plan assets impacts the expense by 1 million 

the discount rate reflects our expectation of the present value of expected future cash payments for benefits at the measurement date a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense we base the discount rate assumption on current investment yields of highquality fixed income investments during the retirement benefits maturity period the pension discount rate was determined by considering an interest rate yield curve comprising aaaaa bonds with maturities between zero and thirty years developed by the plan’s actuaries annual benefit payments are then discounted to present value using this yield curve to develop a singlepoint discount rate matching the plan’s characteristics our weighted average discount rate for all pension plans effective january 1 2013  is 405  we estimate that every 25 basis point change in the discount rate impacts the expense by 2 million 

the rate of future compensation increase assumption reflects our longterm actual experience and future and nearterm outlook effective january 1 2013  our expected rate of future compensation is 357 for all pension plans the estimated impact of a 25 basis point change in the expected rate of future compensation is less than 1 million 

the assumed rate of future increases in the per capita cost of health care the health care trend rate is 768  for 2013  decreasing ratably to 5 in 2020 an increase or decrease in the health care trend rates by one percent per year would impact the aggregate annual service and interest components by less than 1 million and impact the benefit obligation by approximately 8 million to the extent that actual experience differs from these assumptions the effect will be amortized over the average future service of the covered active employees 

funded status 

funded status is derived by subtracting the respective yearend values of the projected benefit obligations from the fair value of plan assets we estimate that every 25 basis point change in the discount rate impacts the funded status by approximately 25 million 

fair value of plan assets 

the plan assets of our pension plans comprise a broad range of investments including domestic and foreign equity securities interests in private equity and hedge funds fixed income investments insurance contracts real estate and cash and cash equivalents 

a portion of our pension benefit plan assets portfolio comprises investments in private equity and hedge funds the private equity and hedge fund investments are generally measured at net asset value however in certain instances the values reported by the asset managers were not current at the measurement date accordingly we made estimate adjustments to the last reported value where necessary to measure the assets at fair value at the measurement date these adjustments consider information received from the asset managers as well as general market information the adjustment recorded at december 31 2012  for these assets represented less than one half of one percent of total plan assets there were no adjustments for these assets at december 31 2011 asset values for other positions were generally measured using market observable prices we estimate that a 5 change in asset values will impact funded status by approximately 22 million 

new accounting pronouncements 

see note 2 “recently issued accounting pronouncements” in the notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements for a complete discussion of recent accounting pronouncements there were no new pronouncements which we expect to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations in future periods 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign currency exchange and interest rates these exposures are actively monitored by management our exposure to foreign exchange rate risk is due to certain costs revenues and borrowings being denominated in currencies other than one of our subsidiaries functional currency similarly we are exposed to market risk as the result of changes in interest rates which may affect the cost of our financing it is our policy and practice to use derivative financial instruments only to the extent necessary to manage exposures 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

our foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to receipts from customers payments to suppliers and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies we may use derivative financial instruments to offset risk related to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers when it is believed that the exposure will not be limited by our normal operating and financing activities in january 2012 we began to enter into currency forward contracts periodically in order to manage the exchange rate fluctuation risk on certain intercompany transactions associated with third party sales and purchases our principal currency exposures relate to the euro swedish krona british pound australian dollar canadian dollar polish zloty and hungarian forint we estimate that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would not be material to xylem’s financial position results of operations or cash flows 

interest rate risk 

as of december 31 2012 we do not have a material exposure to interest rate risk as our debt portfolio entirely comprises longterm fixedrate instruments we do not account for our longterm debt using the fair value option 

commodity price exposures 

portions of our business are exposed to volatility in the prices of certain commodities such as copper nickel and aluminum among others our primary exposure to this volatility resides with the use of these materials in purchased component parts we generally maintain longterm fixed price contracts on raw materials and component parts however we are prone to exposure as these contracts expire we estimate that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in prices for raw metal commodities would not be material to our financial position results of operations or cash flows

 item 1 business tableend separation from itt corporation “itt” 

on october 31 2011 itt corporation completed the previously announced spinoff the “spinoff” of xylem formerly itt’s water equipment and services businesses effective as of 1201 am eastern time on october 31 2011 the “distribution date” the common stock of xylem was distributed on a pro rata basis to itt’s shareholders of record as of the close of business on october 17 2011 the “record date” on the distribution date each of the shareholders of itt received one share of xylem common stock for every one share of common stock of itt held on the record date the spinoff was completed pursuant to the distribution agreement dated as of october 25 2011 among itt exelis inc “exelis” and xylem after the distribution date itt did not beneficially own any shares of xylem common stock and following such date financial results of xylem will not be consolidated in itt’s financial reporting xylem’s registration statement on form 10 filed with the us securities and exchange commission “sec” was declared effective on october 6 2011 xylem’s common stock began “regularway” trading on the new york stock exchange on november 1 2011 under the symbol “xyl” 

business overview 

xylem with 2011 revenue of 38 billion is a world leader in the design manufacturing and application of highly engineered technologies for the water industry we are a leading equipment and service provider for water and wastewater applications with a broad portfolio of products and services addressing the full cycle of water from collection distribution and use to the return of water to the environment we have leading market 

  

positions among equipment and service providers in the core application areas of the water equipment industry transport treatment test building services industrial processing and irrigation our company’s brands such as bell  gossett and flygt are well known throughout the industry and have served the water market for many years 

we operate in two segments water infrastructure and applied water the water infrastructure segment focuses on the transportation treatment and testing of water offering a range of products including water and wastewater pumps treatment and testing equipment and controls and systems key brands in this segment include flygt wedeco godwin pumps wtw sanitaire aadi and leopold the applied water segment encompasses the uses of water and focuses on the residential commercial industrial and agricultural markets the segment’s major products include pumps valves heat exchangers controls and dispensing equipment key brands in this segment include goulds water technology “goulds” bell  gossett ac fire standard flojet lowara jabsco and flowtronex in both our segments we benefit from a large and growing installed base of products driving growth in aftermarket revenue for replacement parts and services 

we serve a global customer base across diverse end markets while offering localized expertise we sell our products in more than 150 countries through a balanced distribution network consisting of our direct sales force and independent channel partners in 2011 approximately 64 of our revenues were generated outside the united states 

our industry 

our planet faces a serious water challenge less than 1 of the total water available on earth is fresh water which is declining due to factors such as the draining of aquifers increased pollution and climate change in addition to this declining supply demand is rising rapidly due to population growth industrial expansion and increased agricultural development with consumption estimated to double every 20 years by 2025 over 30 of the world’s population is expected to live in areas without adequate water supply even in developed countries with sufficient supply existing infrastructure for water supply is relatively underfunded and aging in the united states degrading pipe systems leak one out of every six gallons of water on average on its way from a treatment plant to the customer these challenges are driving opportunities for growth in the global water industry which we estimate to have a total market size of 500 billion 

the water industry supply chain is comprised of equipment and services companies design and build service providers and water utilities equipment and service providers serve two distinct customer types the first utilities supplies water through an infrastructure network companies that operate on this side of the supply chain provide single or sometimes combined functions from equipment manufacturing and services to facility design engineering procurement and construction or “epc” firms to plant operations utilities as depicted below in figure 1 the utility and epc customers are looking for technology and application expertise from their equipment and services providers due to trends such as rising pollution stricter regulations and the increased outsourcing of process knowledge by utilities the second customer type the end users of water comprises a wide array of entities ranging from farms to power plants to residential homes these customers are predominately served through specialized distributors and original equipment manufacturers “oems” 

  

 

 

 our business focuses on the beginning of the supply chain by providing technologyintensive equipment and services we sell our equipment and services via direct and indirect channels that serve the needs of each customer type on the utility side we provide over 70 direct sales with strong application expertise with the remaining amount going through distribution partners to end users of water we provide over 85 of our sales through longstanding relationships with the world’s leading distributors with the remainder going direct to customers the total market opportunity for this equipment and services portion of the water industry supply chain is estimated at 280 billion 

the equipment and services market addresses the key processes of the water industry which is best illustrated through the cycle of water as depicted in figure 2 below we believe this industry has two distinct sectors within the cycle of water supply infrastructure and usage applications the key processes of this cycle begin when raw water is extracted by pumps which provide the necessary pressure and flow to move or transport this water from natural sources such as lakes oceans or aquifers through pipes to a treatment facility treatment facilities can provide many forms of treatment such as filtration disinfection and desalination to remove solids bacteria and salt respectively a network of pipes and pumps again transports this clean water to where it is needed such as to crops for irrigation to power plants to provide cooling in industrial water or to an apartment building as drinking water in residential and commercial building services after usage the wastewater is collected by a separate network of pipes and pumps and transported to a wastewater treatment facility where processes such as digestion deactivate and reduce the volume of solids and disinfection purifies effluent water once treated analytical instruments test the treated water to ensure regulatory requirements are met so that it can be discharged back to the environment thereby completing the cycle 

  

 

 

 our two operating segments are aligned with each of the sectors in the cycle of water water infrastructure serves the supply infrastructure sector and applied water serves usage applications within the supply infrastructure sector our pump systems transport water from aquifers lakes rivers and seas from there our filtration uv and ozone systems provide treatment making the water fit for use after consumption our pump lift stations move the wastewater to treatment facilities where our mixers biological treatment monitoring and control systems provide the primary functions in the treatment process throughout each of these stages our analytical systems test and ensure water quality allowing the water to be consumed and returned to nature our served market size in this sector is approximately 16 billion 

in the usage applications sector we participate in all major areas of water demand irrigation is approximately 70 of all water usage globally examples of what we provide include boosting systems for farming irrigation pumps for dairy operations and rainwater reuse systems for small scale crop and turf irrigation industrial water applications account for 20 of global consumption our pumps heat exchangers valves and controls provide cooling to power plants and manufacturing facilities as well as circulation for food and beverage processing the remaining 10 of global water use resides in human and building consumption where we deliver water boosting systems for drinking heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac and fire protection systems to residential and commercial building services our served market size in this sector is estimated at 14 billion 

customers in the water industry vary by end market two end markets exist within the supply infrastructure sector public utility and industrial representing 85 and 15 of the total equipment and services market respectively the public utility market comprises public private and publicprivate institutions that handle water and wastewater for mostly residential and commercial purposes the industrial market involves the supply of water and removal of wastewater for industrial facilities we view the main macro drivers of this sector to be water quality the desire for energyefficient products water scarcity and infrastructure needs for both the 

  

repair of aging systems in developed countries and new installations in developing countries these markets tend to be less cyclical and are estimated to grow annually in the midsingle digits through 2015 according to management estimates 

in the usage applications sector enduse customers fall into four main markets residential commercial industrial and agricultural homeowners represent the end users in the residential market owners and managers of properties such as apartment buildings retail stores restaurants hospitals and hotels are examples of end users in the commercial market the industrial market is wide ranging involving developers and managers of facilities operated by electrical power generators chemical manufacturers machine shops clothing manufacturers beverage production and dispensing firms and car washes the agricultural market end users are owners and operators of businesses such as crop and livestock farms aquaculture golf courses and other turf applications we believe population growth and urbanization are the two primary macro drivers of these markets as these trends drive the need for housing food community services and retail goods within growing city centers water reuse and conservation are driving the need for new technologies annual total market growth in these industrial commercial residential and agricultural markets is estimated to be in the low to midsingle digits through 2015 according to management estimates

the table below illustrates the annual revenue and longlived assets by geographic area for the three years ended december 31 2011 

 

   

percentage of revenue by geographic area 

 

 distribution training and end use 

water infrastructure provides more than 70 of its sales through direct channels with remaining sales through indirect channels and service capabilities both public utility and industrial facility customers increasingly require our teams’ global but locally proficient expertise to use our equipment in their specific applications several trends are increasing the need for this application expertise i the increase in type and amount of contaminants in water supply ii increasing environmental regulations iii the need to increase system efficiencies due to rising energy costs and iv the retirement of a largely aging water industry workforce not systematically replaced at utilities 

in the applied water segment many enduse areas are widely different so specialized distribution partners are often preferred our commercial teams have built longstanding relationships around our brands in many of these industries through which we can continue to leverage new product and service applications revenue opportunities are balanced between oem and aftermarket customers our products in the applied water segment are sold through our global direct sales and worldclass indirect channels with more than 85 of revenue going through indirect channels we have longstanding relationships with the leading independent distributors in the markets we serve and we provide incentives to distributors such as specialized training programs to exclusively sell our products 

aftermarket parts and service 

we have more than 120 service centers around the world which employ approximately 600 service employees to provide aftermarket parts and services to our customers during their lifecycle installed products require maintenance repair services and parts due to the harsh environments in which they operate 

in addition depending on the type of product median lifecycles range from 5 years to over 50 years at which time they must be replaced many of our products are precisely selected and applied within a larger network of equipment driving a strong preference by customers and installers to replace them with the same exact brand and model when they reach the end of their lifecycle this dynamic establishes a large recurring revenue stream for our business 

supply and seasonality 

we have a global manufacturing footprint with production facilities in europe north america latin america and asia in addition we maintain a global network of service centers providing aftermarket customer care service centers offer an array of integrated service solutions for the industry including preventive monitoring contract maintenance emergency field service engineered upgrades inventory management and overhauls for pumps and other rotating equipment 

we offer a wide range of highly engineered products we primarily employ configuretoorder capabilities to maximize manufacturing and logistics efficiencies by producing high volumes of basic product configurations when we provide a configuretoorder solution we configure a standard product to our customers’ specifications to a lesser extent we provide engineertoorder products to meet the customization requirements of our customers this process requires that we apply our technical expertise and production capabilities to provide a nonstandard solution to the customer 

our inventory management and distribution practices seek to minimize inventory holding periods by taking delivery of the inventory and manufacturing immediately prior to the sale or distribution of products to our 

  

customers all of our businesses require various parts and raw materials the availability and prices of which may fluctuate parts and raw materials commonly used in our products include motors fabricated parts castings bearings seals nickel copper aluminum and plastics while we may recover some cost increases through operational improvements we are still exposed to some pricing risk we attempt to control costs through fixedpriced contracts with suppliers and various other programs such as our global strategic sourcing initiative 

our business relies on thirdparty suppliers contract manufacturing and commodity markets to secure raw materials parts and components used in our products we typically acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our materials requirements for most of our products we have existing alternate sources of supply or such sources are readily available 

we may experience price volatility or supply constraints for materials that are not available from multiple sources from time to time we acquire certain inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longerterm pricing commitments with vendors to improve the priority price and availability of supply there have been no raw material shortages that have had a significant adverse impact on our business as a whole 

customers 

our business is not dependent on any single customer or a few customers the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on the respective market or on us as a whole no individual customer accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated 2011 revenue 

backlog 

delivery schedules vary from customer to customer based upon their requirements typically large projects require longer lead production cycles and delays can occur from time to time total backlog was 651 million at december 31 2011 and 620 million at december 31 2010 we anticipate that in excess of 80 of the backlog at december 31 2011 will be recognized as revenue during 2012 

competition 

given the highly fragmented nature of the water industry water infrastructure competes with a large number of businesses competition in the water transport and treatment technologies markets focuses on product performance application expertise design quality delivery and price in the sale of products and services we benefit from our large installed base of pumps and complementary products which require maintenance repair and replacement parts due to the nature of the products and the conditions under which they operate timeliness of delivery quality and the proximity of service centers are important customer considerations when selecting a provider for aftermarket products and services as well as equipment rentals in geographic regions where we are locally positioned to provide a quick response customers have historically relied on us rather than our competitors for aftermarket products relating to our highly engineered and customized solutions 

competition in the applied water segment focuses on brand names application expertise product delivery and performance quality and price we compete by offering a wide variety of innovative and high quality products coupled with worldclass application expertise we believe our distribution through wellestablished channels and our reputation for quality significantly enhance our market position our ability to deliver innovative product offerings has allowed us to compete effectively to cultivate and maintain customer relationships and to serve and to expand into many niche and new markets 

research and development 

research and development “rd” is a key element of our engineering culture and is generally focused on the design and development of products and application knowhow that anticipate customer needs and emerging trends our engineers are involved in new product development and improvement of existing products our businesses invest substantial resources for rd we anticipate we will continue to develop and invest in our rd capabilities to promote a steady flow of innovative highquality and reliable products and applications to further strengthen our position in the markets we serve we invested 100 million 74 million and 63 million for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively towards rd 

  

we have over 600 engineering and research employees in more than 40 technology centers around the world rd activities are initially conducted in our technology centers located in conjunction with some of our major manufacturing facilities to ensure an efficient development process we have established a wastewater center of excellence in stockholm sweden with over 100 research development and engineering employees we have launched centers of excellence in india and china where we are accelerating the customization of our application expertise to local needs in the scaleup process our rd activities are conducted at our piloting and testing facilities or at strategic customer sites these piloting and testing facilities enable us to serve our strategic markets in each region of the world 

we generally seek patent protection for those inventions and improvements likely to be incorporated into our products or where proprietary rights will improve our competitive position we believe that our patents and applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and improving our return on research and development investments while we own control or license a significant number of patents trade secrets confidential information trademarks trade names copyrights and other intellectual property rights which in the aggregate are of material importance to our business management believes that our business as a whole as well as each of our core business segments is not materially dependent on any one intellectual property right or related group of such rights 

patents patent applications and license agreements expire or terminate over time by operation of law in accordance with their terms or otherwise as the portfolio of our patents patent applications and license agreements has evolved over time we do not expect the expiration of any specific patent to have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

environmental matters and regulation 

our manufacturing operations worldwide are subject to many requirements under environmental laws in the united states the environmental protection agency and similar state agencies administer laws and regulations concerning air emissions water discharges waste disposal environmental remediation and other aspects of environmental protection such environmental laws and regulations in the united states include for example the federal clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act environmental requirements significantly affect our operations we have established an internal program to address compliance with applicable environmental requirements and as a result management believes that we are in substantial compliance with current environmental regulations 

while environmental laws and regulations are subject to change such changes can be difficult to predict reliably and the timing of potential changes is uncertain management does not believe based on current circumstances that compliance costs pursuant to such regulations will have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows however the effect of future legislative or regulatory changes could be material to our financial condition or results of operations 

accruals for environmental matters are recorded on a sitebysite basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on current law and existing technologies it can be difficult to estimate reliably the final costs of investigation and remediation due to various factors our accrued liabilities for these environmental matters represent the best estimates related to the investigation and remediation of environmental media such as water soil soil vapor air and structures as well as related legal fees based upon the facts and circumstances as currently known to us these estimates and related accruals are reviewed quarterly and updated for progress of investigation and remediation efforts and changes in facts and legal circumstances liabilities for these environmental expenditures are recorded on an undiscounted basis we do not anticipate these liabilities will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated and combined financial position results of operations or cash flows we cannot make assurances that other sites or new details about sites known to us that could give rise to environmental liabilities with such material adverse effects on us will not be identified in the future at december 31 2011 we had estimated and accrued 15 million related to environmental matters

we provide products and services into competitive markets we believe the principal points of competition in our markets are product performance reliability and innovation application expertise brand reputation energy efficiency product life cycle cost timeliness of delivery proximity of service centers effectiveness of our distribution channels and price maintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment by us in manufacturing research and development engineering marketing customer service and support and our distribution networks we may not be successful in maintaining our competitive position our competitors may develop products that are superior to our products or may develop more efficient or effective methods of providing products and services or may adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies or evolving customer requirements pricing pressures also could cause us to adjust the prices of certain products to stay competitive we may not be able to compete successfully with our existing or new competitors failure to continue competing successfully could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

our business could be adversely affected by the inability of suppliers to meet delivery requirements 

our business relies on thirdparty suppliers contract manufacturing and commodity markets to secure raw materials parts and components used in our products parts and raw materials commonly used in our products include motors fabricated parts castings bearings seals nickel copper aluminum and plastics we are exposed to the availability of these materials which may be subject to curtailment or change due to among other things interruptions in production by suppliers labor disputes the impaired financial condition of a particular supplier suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels ability to meet regulatory requirements weather emergencies or acts of war or terrorism any delay in our suppliers’ abilities to provide us with necessary materials could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers and accordingly could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

  

our strategy includes acquisitions and we may not be able to make acquisitions of suitable candidates or integrate acquisitions successfully 

our historical growth has included acquisitions as part of our growth strategy we plan to pursue the acquisition of other companies assets and product lines that either complement or expand our existing business we cannot assure you however that we will be able to identify suitable candidates successfully negotiate appropriate acquisition terms obtain financing that may be needed to consummate those acquisitions complete proposed acquisitions successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or expand into new markets in addition we cannot assure you that any acquisition once successfully integrated will perform as planned be accretive to earnings or prove to be beneficial to our operations or cash flow 

acquisitions involve a number of risks and present financial managerial and operational challenges including diversion of management attention from existing businesses and operations integration of technology operations personnel and financial and other systems potentially insufficient internal controls over financial activities or financial reporting at an acquired entity that could impact us on a combined basis the failure to realize expected synergies the possibility that we have acquired substantial undisclosed liabilities and the loss of key employees of the acquired businesses 

our business could be adversely affected by inflation and other manufacturing and operating cost increases 

our operating costs are subject to fluctuations particularly due to changes in commodity prices raw materials energy and related utilities freight and cost of labor in order to remain competitive we may not be able to recuperate all or a portion of these higher costs from our customers through product price increases further our ability to realize financial benefits from six sigma and lean projects may not be able to mitigate fully or in part these manufacturing and operating cost increases and as a result could negatively impact our profitability 

changes in our effective tax rates may adversely affect our financial results 

we sell our products in more than 150 countries and approximately 64 of our revenue was generated outside the united states in 2011 given the global nature of our business a number of factors may increase our future effective tax rates including 

 

  

  

  

  

 any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could reduce net income for future periods 

failure to comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act or other applicable anticorruption legislation could result in fines criminal penalties and an adverse effect on our business 

we operate in a number of countries throughout the world including countries known to have a reputation for corruption we are committed to doing business in accordance with applicable anticorruption laws we are subject however to the risk that we our affiliated entities or our or their respective officers directors employees and agents may take action determined to be in violation of such anticorruption laws including the us foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 the uk bribery act of 2010 and others any such violation could result in substantial fines sanctions civil andor criminal penalties and curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions and might adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition in addition actual or alleged violations could damage our reputation and ability to do business furthermore detecting investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations is expensive and can consume significant time and attention of our senior management 

  

we may be negatively impacted by litigation and regulatory proceedings 

we are subject to laws regulations and potential liability relating to claims complaints and proceedings including those related to antitrust environmental product and other matters 

we are subject to various laws ordinances regulations and other requirements of government authorities in foreign countries and in the united states any violations of which could potentially create a substantial liability for us and also could cause harm to our reputation changes in laws ordinances regulations or other government policies the nature timing and effect of which are uncertain may significantly increase our expenses and liabilities 

from time to time we are involved in legal proceedings that are incidental to the operation of our businesses some of these proceedings seek remedies relating to environmental matters intellectual property matters product liability and personal injury claims employment and pension matters government contract issues and commercial or contractual disputes sometimes related to acquisitions or divestitures we may become subject to significant claims of which we are currently unaware or the claims of which we are aware may result in our incurring a significantly greater liability than we anticipate or can estimate additionally we may receive fines or penalties or be required to change or cease operations at one or more facilities if a regulatory agency determines that we have failed to comply with laws regulations or orders applicable to our business 

our business could be adversely affected by interruptions in information technology communications networks and operations 

our business operations rely on information technology and communications networks and operations that are vulnerable to damage or disturbance from a variety of sources regardless of protection measures essentially all systems are susceptible to disruption due to failure vandalism computer viruses security breaches natural disasters power outages and other events in addition cybersecurity threats are evolving and include among others malicious software attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in our systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data we also have a concentration of operations on certain sites eg production and shared services centers where business interruptions could cause material damage and costs transport of goods from suppliers and to customers could also be hampered for the reasons stated above although we have assessed these risks implemented controls and performed business continuity planning we cannot be sure that interruptions with material adverse effects will not occur 

risks related to liquidity 

our indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operational flexibility 

as of december 31 2011 our total outstanding indebtedness was 1206 million including our 355 senior notes of 600 million aggregate principal amount due september 2016 and 4875 senior notes of 600 million aggregate principal amount due october 2021 we have an existing four year competitive advance and revolving credit facility the “credit facility” which provides for an aggregate principal amount of up to 600 million 

our indebtedness could 

 

  

  

  

  

   

 in addition there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available to us on favorable terms or at all for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness if we incur additional debt or raise equity through the issuance of our preferred stock the terms of the debt or our preferred stock issued may give the holders rights preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock particularly in the event of liquidation the terms of the debt may also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on our operations than we currently have also regardless of the terms of our debt or equity financing the amount of our stock that we can issue may be limited because the issuance of our stock may cause the distribution to be a taxable event for itt under section 355e of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” and under the tax matters agreement entered into by itt in connection with the spinoff the “tax matters agreement” we could be required to indemnify itt for that tax 

our ability to make scheduled principal payments of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance which may be affected by factors beyond our control if we are unable to service our indebtedness our business financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 

risks related to external factors 

our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by global economic and financial market conditions 

we compete around the world in various geographic and product markets in 2011 37 and 36 of our total revenue was from customers located in europe and the united states respectively we expect revenue from these markets to be significant for the foreseeable future important factors impacting our businesses include the overall strength of these economies and our customers’ confidence in both local and global macroeconomic conditions industrial and federal state local and municipal governmental spending the strength of the residential and commercial real estate markets interest rates availability of commercial financing for our customers and endusers and unemployment rates a slowdown or downturn in these financial or macroeconomic conditions could have a significant adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in revenues and operating results due to economic and business cycles particularly within the portion of our business that provides products and services used in residential and commercial buildings we believe our level of business activity is influenced by residential and commercial building starts and renovations which are heavily influenced by interest rates consumer debt levels changes in disposable income employment growth and consumer confidence credit market conditions greatly affect the ability of residential and commercial builders to obtain the necessary capital to complete and begin new projects we closely monitor the credit worthiness of our customers and evaluate their financial ability to pay for those products and services we provide to them as it relates to our customers’ ability to pay for products and services we have not experienced any significant negative impact as a result of the recent economic downturn if market conditions worsen it may result in the delay or cancellation of orders from our customers or potential customers and adversely affect our revenues and our ability to manage inventory levels collect customer receivables and maintain current levels of profitability 

economic and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our business 

in 2011 64 of our total revenue was from customers outside the united states we expect our international operations and export sales to continue to be a significant portion of our revenue both our sales from international operations and export sales are subject in varying degrees to risks inherent to doing business outside the united states these risks include the following 

 

  

   

  

  

  

 any payment of distributions loans or advances to us by our foreign subsidiaries could be subject to restrictions on or taxation of dividends on repatriation of earnings under applicable local law monetary transfer restrictions and foreign currency exchange regulations in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate in addition to the general risks that we face outside the united states we now conduct more of our operations in emerging markets than we have in the past which could involve additional uncertainties for us including risks that governments may impose limitations on our ability to repatriate funds governments may impose withholding or other taxes on remittances and other payments to us or the amount of any such taxes may increase an outbreak or escalation of any insurrection or armed conflict may occur governments may seek to nationalize our assets or governments may impose or increase investment barriers or other restrictions affecting our business in addition emerging markets pose other uncertainties including the protection of our intellectual property pressure on the pricing of our products and risks of political instability we cannot predict the impact such future largely unforeseeable events might have on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

our business could be adversely affected by significant movements in foreign currency exchange rates 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly with respect to the euro swedish krona british pound australian dollar canadian dollar polish zloty and hungarian forint any significant change in the value of currencies of the countries in which we do business relative to the value of the us dollar could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

the level of returns on postretirement benefit plan assets changes in interest rates and other factors could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods 

certain members of our current and retired employee population are covered by pension and other employeerelated defined benefit plans collectively postretirement benefit plans we may experience significant fluctuations in costs related to our postretirement benefit plans as a result of macroeconomic factors such as interest rates that are beyond our control the cost of our postretirement plans is incurred over long periods of time and involves factors and uncertainties during those periods which can be volatile and unpredictable including rates of return on postretirement benefit plan assets discount rates used to calculate liabilities and expenses and rates of future compensation increases management develops each assumption using relevant plan and company experience and expectations in conjunction with marketrelated data our liquidity financial position including shareholders’ equity and results of operations could be materially affected by significant changes in key economic indicators actuarial experience financial market volatility future legislation and other governmental regulatory actions 

we make contributions to fund our postretirement benefit plans when considered necessary or advantageous to do so the macroeconomic factors discussed above including the return on postretirement benefit plan assets and the minimum funding requirements established by local government funding or taxing authorities or established by other agreement may influence future funding requirements a significant decline in the fair value of our plan assets or other adverse changes to our overall pension and other employeerelated benefit plans could require us to make significant funding contributions and affect cash flows in future periods 

weather conditions may adversely affect our financial results 

weather conditions particularly heavy flooding and droughts can benefit portions of our business which provide equipment with dewatering and irrigation applications pumps provided through our godwin brand are used to remove excess or unwanted water heavy flooding due to weather conditions drives increased demand 

  

for these applications drought conditions drive higher demand for pumps used in agricultural and turf irrigation applications such as those provided by our goulds flowtronex and lowara brands we cannot assure you that weather conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

unforeseen environmental issues could impact our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our operations are subject to and affected by many federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations in addition we could be affected by future environmental laws or regulations including for example those imposed in response to climate change concerns compliance with current and future environmental laws and regulations currently requires and is expected to continue to require operating and capital expenditures 

environmental laws and regulations may authorize substantial fines and criminal sanctions as well as facility shutdowns to address violations and may require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit emissions or discharges we also incur and expect to continue to incur costs to comply with current environmental laws and regulations related to remediation of conditions in the environment 

developments such as the adoption of new environmental laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations violations by us of such laws and regulations discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination litigation involving environmental impacts our inability to recover costs associated with any such developments or financial insolvency of other responsible parties could in the future have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

risks related to our recent separation 

if the spinoff were to fail to qualify as a taxfree transaction under the internal revenue code then we andor our former parent and our stockholders could be subject to significant tax liability 

in connection with the spinoff we and our former parent itt corporation received an irs ruling the “irs ruling” stating that itt and its shareholders will not recognize any taxable income gain or loss for us federal income tax purposes as a result of the spinoff in addition itt received an opinion of tax counsel as to the satisfaction of certain requirements necessary for the spinoff to receive taxfree treatment upon which the irs did not rule the irs ruling while generally binding upon the irs was based on certain factual statements and representations if any such factual statements or representations were incomplete or untrue in any material respect or if the facts on which the irs ruling were based were materially different from the facts at the time of the spinoff the irs could modify or revoke the irs ruling retroactively 

as discussed above certain requirements for taxfree treatment that are not covered in the irs ruling were addressed in the opinion of counsel the opinion of counsel is not binding on the irs accordingly the irs may reach conclusions with respect to the spinoff that are different from the conclusions reached in the opinion like the irs ruling the opinion was based on certain factual statements and representations which if incomplete or untrue in any material respect could alter counsel’s conclusions 

if all or a portion of the spinoff does not qualify as a taxfree transaction because any of the factual statements or representations in the irs ruling or the legal opinion are incomplete or untrue or because the facts upon which the irs ruling is based were materially different from the facts at the time of the spinoff itt would recognize a substantial gain for us federal income tax purposes in such case under us treasury regulations each member of the itt consolidated group at the time of the spinoff including us and our subsidiaries would be jointly and severally liable for the entire amount of any resulting us federal income tax liability 

notwithstanding the foregoing the spinoff will be taxable to itt but not to itt shareholders pursuant to section 355e of the internal revenue code if there are one or more acquisitions including issuances of the stock of either us or itt representing 50 or more measured by vote or value of the thenoutstanding stock 

  

of either corporation and the acquisition or acquisitions are deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the spinoff any acquisition of our common stock within two years before or after the spinoff with exceptions including public trading by lessthan5 shareholders and certain compensatory stock issuances generally will be presumed to be part of such a plan unless that presumption is rebutted the tax liability resulting from the application of section 355e would be substantial in addition under us treasury regulations each member of the itt consolidated group at the time of the spinoff including us and our subsidiaries would be severally liable for the resulting us federal income tax liability 

we have agreed not to enter into any transaction that could cause any portion of the spinoff to be taxable to itt including under section 355e pursuant to the tax matters agreement dated as of october 25 2011 among itt exelis and xylem we have also agreed to indemnify itt and exelis for any tax liabilities resulting from such transactions and itt and exelis have agreed to indemnify us for any tax liabilities resulting from such transactions entered into by itt or exelis these obligations may discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company 

we may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from the spinoff 

as an independent publicly traded company we believe that our business will benefit from among other things i greater strategic focus of financial resources and management’s efforts ii enhanced customer focus iii direct and differentiated access to capital resources iv enhanced investor choices by offering investment opportunities in a separate entity from itt v improved management incentive tools and vi utilization of stock as an acquisition currency however as a result of separating from itt we may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than we would have been as a part of itt in addition we may not be able to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as an independent company in the time we expect if at all 

we may incur greater costs as an independent company than we did when we were part of itt 

as a part of itt we had the advantage of itt’s size and purchasing power in procuring certain goods and services such as insurance and health care benefits and technology such as computer software licenses we also relied on itt to provide various corporate functions as a separate independent entity we may be unable to obtain these goods services and technologies at prices or on terms as favorable to us as those we obtained prior to the distribution we may also incur costs for functions previously performed by itt that are higher than the amounts reflected in our historical financial statements which may cause our profitability to decrease 

we do not have a recent operating history as an independent company and our historical financial information may not be a reliable indicator of our future results 

the historical financial information we have included in this annual report has been prepared on a “carveout” basis from itt’s consolidated financial statements and does not necessarily reflect what our financial position results of operations and cash flows would have been as a separate standalone entity during the periods presented itt did not account for us and we were not operated as a single standalone entity or segment for all the periods presented in addition the historical information is not necessarily indicative of what our results of operations financial position and cash flows will be in the future while we were profitable as part of itt we cannot assume that as a standalone company our profits will continue at a similar level 

our customers prospective customers and suppliers will need assurances that our financial stability on a standalone basis is sufficient to satisfy their requirements for doing or continuing to do business with them 

some of our customers prospective customers and suppliers will need assurances that our financial stability on a standalone basis is sufficient to satisfy their requirements for doing or continuing to do business with them if our customers prospective customers or suppliers are not satisfied with our financial stability it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to bid for and obtain or retain projects our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

our accounting and other management systems and resources may not be adequately prepared to meet the financial reporting and other requirements to which we are subject as a new independent publicly traded company 

our financial results previously were included within the consolidated results of itt and we believe that our financial reporting and internal controls were appropriate for those of subsidiaries of a public company however we were not directly subject to the reporting and other requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” as an independent publicly traded company we are subject to reporting and other obligations under the exchange act beginning with our annual report on form 10k for the year ending december 31 2012 we will be required to comply with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the “sarbanesoxley act” which will require annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accounting firm addressing these assessments these reporting and other obligations may place significant demands on our management administrative and operational resources including accounting systems and resources 

the exchange act requires that we file annual quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition under the sarbanesoxley act we are required to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting we expect to incur additional annual expenses for the purpose of addressing these requirements and those expenses may be significant if we are unable to upgrade our financial and management controls reporting systems information technology systems and procedures in a timely and effective fashion our ability to comply with our financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies under the exchange act could be impaired any failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

the spinoff may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal distribution requirements 

the spinoff could be challenged under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws an unpaid creditor or an entity vested with the power of such creditor such as a trustee or debtorinpossession in a bankruptcy could claim that the spinoff left us itt andor exelis insolvent or with unreasonably small capital or that we itt andor exelis intended or believed it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay as they mature and that itt did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value in the spinoff if a court were to agree with such a plaintiff then such court could void the spinoff as a fraudulent transfer and could impose a number of different remedies which could adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations among other things the court could require the return of assets or our shares to itt voiding the liens of xylem and claims against itt or providing itt with a claim for money damages against us 

the measure of insolvency for purposes of the fraudulent conveyance laws will vary depending on which jurisdiction’s law is applied generally however an entity would be considered insolvent if either the fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount of its liabilities including the probable amount of contingent liabilities or it is unlikely to be able to pay its liabilities as they become due no assurance can be given as to what standard a court would apply to determine insolvency or that a court would determine that we itt or exelis were solvent at the time of or after giving effect to the spinoff 

the spinoff could also be challenged under state corporate distribution statutes under the indiana business corporation law a corporation may not make distributions to its shareholders if after giving effect to the distribution i the corporation would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business or ii the corporation’s total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities no assurance can be given that a court will not later determine that the distribution of our shares in connection with the spinoff was unlawful 

under the distribution agreement from and after the spinoff we will be responsible for the debts liabilities and other obligations related to the business or businesses which we own and operate following the consummation of the spinoff although we do not expect to be liable for any of these or other obligations not expressly assumed by us pursuant to the distribution agreement it is possible that we could be required to assume responsibility for certain obligations retained by itt or exelis should itt or exelis fail to pay or perform its retained obligations for example tax asbestos andor environmental liabilities 

  

in connection with our separation itt and exelis will indemnify us for certain liabilities and we will indemnify itt or exelis for certain liabilities if we are required to indemnify itt or exelis we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations and our financial results could be negatively impacted in the case of itt’s or exelis’s indemnity there can be no assurance that those indemnities will be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of such liabilities or as to itt’s or exelis’s ability to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future 

pursuant to the distribution agreement and certain other agreements with itt and exelis itt and exelis agreed to indemnify us from certain liabilities and we agreed to indemnify itt and exelis for certain liabilities indemnities that we may be required to provide itt and exelis may be significant and could negatively impact our business particularly indemnities relating to our actions that could impact the taxfree nature of the spinoff third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that itt or exelis has agreed to retain further there can be no assurance that the indemnities from itt and exelis will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities or that itt and exelis will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations moreover even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from itt and exelis any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves each of these risks could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

risks relating to our common stock 

you face the following risks in connection with ownership of our common stock 

there is not a long market history for our common stock and the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly 

we cannot predict the prices at which our common stock may trade the market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely depending on many factors some of which may be beyond our control including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

  

we cannot assure you that we will pay dividends on our common stock and our indebtedness could limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock 

the timing declaration amount and payment of future dividends to our shareholders fall within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on many factors including our financial condition results of operations and capital requirements as well as applicable law regulatory constraints industry practice and other business considerations that our board of directors considers relevant there can be no assurance that we will pay a dividend in the future or continue to pay dividends 

additionally if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our debtpayment obligations then our ability to pay dividends if so determined by the board of directors will be impaired and we may be required to attempt to restructure or refinance our debt raise additional capital or take other actions such as selling assets reducing or delaying capital expenditures or reducing our dividend there can be no assurance however that any such actions could be effected on satisfactory terms if at all or would be permitted by the terms of our debt or our other credit and contractual arrangements 

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents and indiana law could delay or prevent a change in control 

certain provisions of our amended and restated articles of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a shareholder may consider favorable for example the amended and restated articles of incorporation and the amended and restated bylaws among other things provide for a classified board and require advance notice for shareholder proposals and nominations do not permit shareholders to convene special meetings and do not permit action by written consent of the shareholders in addition the amended and restated articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock these provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control which could harm our stock price indiana law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 10 or more of our outstanding common stock and us as well as certain restrictions on the voting rights of “control shares” of an “issuing public corporation” 

under the tax matters agreement we have agreed not to enter into any transaction involving an acquisition including issuance of xylem common stock or any other transaction or to the extent we have the right to prohibit it to permit any such transaction that could cause the spinoff to be taxable to itt we have also agreed to indemnify itt for any tax resulting from any such transactions generally itt will recognize taxable gain on the spinoff if there are one or more acquisitions including issuances of our capital stock directly or indirectly representing 50 or more measured by vote or value of our thenoutstanding capital stock and the acquisitions or issuances are deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the spinoff any such shares of our common stock acquired directly or indirectly within two years before or after the spinoff with exceptions including public trading by lessthan5 shareholders and certain compensatory stock issuances will generally be presumed to be part of such a plan unless that presumption is rebutted as a result our obligations may discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company

revenue 

revenue generated for 2011 was 3803 million an increase of 601 million or 188 compared to 3202 million in the same period of 2010 the following table illustrates the impact from organic growth recent acquisitions and fluctuations in foreign currency in relation to revenue during the annual 2011 period 

in millions 

 

 the following table summarizes revenue by segment for 2011 and 2010 

in millions 

 

 water infrastructure 

water infrastructure’s revenue increased 486 million or 252 in 2011 including incremental revenue of 264 million from acquisitions including godwin and nova in 2010 and ysi in september 2011 our 2011 acquisition of ysi contributed 35 million and continued our expansion in the analytical instrumentation market 

organic revenue growth of 137 million or 71 during the year was primarily attributable to transport and treatment applications transport increased due to dewatering equipment volume from both the public utility and industrial sectors the results also reflect increased public utility investment in treatment projects in latin america and the middle east overall growth was partially offset by decreased volume in southern europe which continues to present challenging economic conditions 

foreign currency translation was favorable by 87 million for the annual period ended december 31 2011 as compared to 2010 

applied water 

applied water’s revenue increased 117 million or 88 in 2011 driven by organic revenue growth of 88 million or 66 the organic revenue growth reflects gains across all regions lead by doubledigit growth rates in eastern europe latin america china and the middle east primarily due to increased volume in light industrial and building service applications as a result of new products such as esv a highefficiency vertical multistage pump and increased volume in the irrigation applications as a result of favorable weather conditions in the united states pricing initiatives executed throughout the period also contributed to the revenue growth 

foreign currency translation was favorable by 28 million for 2011 as compared to 2010 

  

ordersbacklog 

orders received during 2011 increased by 610 million or 188 to 3847 million including benefits of 272 million from acquisitions and 120 million from foreign currency translation adjustments organic order growth was 67 for the year the water infrastructure segment generated order growth of 513 million or 264 to 2454 million including 272 million and 96 million from acquisitions and favorable foreign currency respectively order growth in our applied water segment was 100 million or 74 to 1452 million driven by 53 organic order growth and 27 million of favorable foreign currency translation due to increased activity in the light industrial agriculture and heat transfer markets 

delivery schedules vary from customer to customer based upon their requirements typically large projects require longer lead production cycles and delays can occur from time to time total backlog was 651 million at december 31 2011 and 620 million at december 31 2010 we anticipate that in excess of 80 of the backlog at december 31 2011 will be recognized as revenue during 2012 

gross margin 

gross margins as a percentage of consolidated revenue increased to 384 in 2011 from 379 in 2010 the increase is attributable to benefits from productivity and price realization initiatives offset in part by rising commodity costs and higher labor and overhead costs due to increased spending related to additional volume 

operating expenses excluding separation costs 

in millions 

 

 selling general and administrative expenses 

sga increased by 140 million to 877 million or 231 of revenue in 2011 as compared to 737 million or 230 of revenue in 2010 the increase in sga expenses is principally due to sales volume related increases in selling marketing and distribution expenses including the impact of recent acquisitions 

research and development expenses 

rd spending increased 26 million to 100 million or 26 of revenue for 2011 as compared to 74 million or 23 of revenue in 2010 these increases were primarily due to 11 million incremental expense from recent acquisitions and programs as we continued to invest in new product developments 

restructuring and asset impairment charges net 

during 2011 we incurred a 2 million charge related to the impairment of a facility in our applied water segment during 2010 we recognized restructuring charges totaling 15 million as part of an initiative to improve effectiveness and efficiency of operations as of december 31 2011 we consider these restructuring initiatives to be substantially completed with a remaining liability of 1 million 

  

separation costs 

we had nonrecurring pretax separation costs of 87 million or 72 million after tax during 2011 the components of separation costs incurred during these periods is presented below in millions 

 

  

 our current estimate of the pretax cash impact of the remaining activities associated with the separation ranges from approximately 15 million to 20 million 

operating income 

we generated operating income of 395 million during 2011 a 18 increase from the prior year primarily reflecting increased revenues offset in part by nonrecurring separation costs of 87 million the following table illustrates operating income results by business segments for 2011 and 2010 

 

   

the table included below provides a reconciliation from segment operating income to adjusted operating income and a calculation of the corresponding adjusted operating margin 

 

  

 water infrastructure 

operating income for our water infrastructure segment increased 67 million or 243 83 million or 301 excluding separation costs compared with the prior year this increase is led by incremental operating income of 42 million from acquisitions over the same period also contributing to the increase were higher sales volumes lower restructuring expense and benefits from productivity and material costs savings initiatives partially offset by higher labor and overhead costs material inflation and unfavorable mix 

applied water 

operating income for our applied water segment increased 2 million or 13 15 million or 95 excluding separation costs compared to the prior year as higher sales volume and price realization was partially offset by increased spend on research and development and the unfavorable impacts of inflation and customer and product mix 

interest expense 

interest expense increased to 17 million in 2011 primarily reflecting interest related to the issuance of 12 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes issued in september 2011 refer to note 8 “credit facilities and longterm debt” for further details 

income tax expense 

the income tax provision for 2011 was 104 million at an effective tax rate of 274 compared to 59 million at an effective tax rate of 152 in 2010 the 2011 effective tax rate is higher than 2010 as a result of the unfavorable impact of recording a deferred tax liability on the excess of financial reporting over the tax basis of investments in certain foreign subsidiaries that has not been permanently reinvested non deductible separation costs increase in valuation allowances on certain foreign losses offset in part by tax examination settlements and increased tax exempt interest 

  

year ended december 31 2010 compared to year ended december 31 2009 

revenue 

revenue generated during the year ended december 31 2010 was 3202 million reflecting an increase of 353 million or 124 as compared to prior year our 2010 revenue was marked by growth from strategic acquisitions a level of economic recovery within the majority of our served markets and foreign currency translation 

the following table illustrates the impact from organic growth recent acquisitions and fluctuations in foreign currency in relation to revenue during 2010 

in millions 

 

 the following table summarizes revenue by segment for 2010 and 2009 

in millions 

 

 water infrastructure 

revenue generated by our water infrastructure segment for the year ended december 31 2010 was 1930 million reflecting an increase of 279 million or 169 as compared to the prior year this increase was primarily driven by incremental revenue from acquisitions including godwin and nova which in the aggregate contributed 247 million 

organic revenue increased 15 in 2010 reflecting mixed regional results market share gains and favorable economic conditions drove improved performance for treatment applications in northern europe and in emerging markets such as asia pacific eastern europe and latin america however unfavorable economic conditions and uncertainty within the region continued to negatively impact performance across our southern european markets 

foreign exchange translation was favorable by 8 million for 2010 as compared to 2009 

applied water 

applied water’s revenue increased 73 million or 58 for 2010 compared to 2009 as contributions from the 2009 laing acquisition of 19 million were partially offset by a decline in revenues from businesses divested of 3 million 

despite relatively weak market conditions throughout the year we recorded organic revenue growth of 72 million or 58 over 2009 this growth was primarily attributable to european and emerging market share gains as well as the impact from new product launches including energy efficient pumps and new beverage applications we also benefited from price realization initiatives organic revenue growth was partially offset by unfavorable weather conditions in north america which negatively impacted our sales of irrigation applications 

foreign exchange translation was unfavorable by 16 million for 2010 as compared to 2009 

  

gross margin 

gross margins as a percentage of revenue increased 150 basis points to 379 in 2010 compared to 364 in 2009 the increase includes gross profits driven by increased organic sales volume and benefits from productivity and price realization initiatives 

operating expenses 

in millions 

 

 selling general and administrative expenses 

sga increased by 70 million to 737 million or 23 of revenue in 2010 as compared to 667 million or 234 of revenue in 2009 the increase in sga expenses is principally due to additional costs of 55 million in each period related primarily to our newly acquired godwin and nova businesses as well as costs attributable to an increase in sales volumes and additional spending on various strategic investments 

research and development expenses 

rd spending increased 11 million to 74 million or 23 of revenue in 2010 as compared to 63 million or 22 in 2009 primarily due to our newly acquired nova business 

restructuring and asset impairment charges net 

during 2010 we recognized net restructuring charges of 15 million representing a 16 million or 516 decrease as compared to the prior year during 2009 we initiated several actions primarily within our applied water segment in response to declining market conditions the frequency and overall impact of such actions subsided and as a result we incurred less cost during 2010 

operating income 

we generated operating income of 388 million in 2010 which reflects an increase from the prior year of 406 operating margin increased to 121 a yearoveryear increase of 240 basis points the following table illustrates operating income results of our business segments including operating margin results for 2010 and 2009 

in millions 

 

   

water infrastructure 

operating income for our water infrastructure segment increased 49 million or 216 for 2010 compared with 2009 this increase is primarily attributable to contributions from the nova and godwin acquisitions which provided combined incremental operating income of 28 million during 2010 operating productivity and lower restructuring expense more than offset incremental strategic investments higher pension costs and unfavorable foreign currency impacts as a result we saw operating margin expansion of 60 basis points over 2009 

applied water 

operating income for our applied water segment increased 49 million or 450 for the year ended december 31 2010 compared with the prior year operating productivity including increased volume increased price benefits from our cost savings initiatives and lower restructuring charges of 12 million more than offset incremental costs associated with strategic initiatives operating margin expansion of 320 basis points over 2009 was largely attributable to these same factors 

income tax expense 

in 2010 and 2009 we recorded an income tax provision of 59 million and 14 million respectively which represents effective tax rates of 152 and 50 respectively for 2010 the effective tax rate is lower than the federal statutory rate of 35 due principally to a lower rate incurred on foreign earnings and the favorable impact of the repatriation of foreign earnings net of foreign tax credits for 2009 the effective tax rate is lower than the federal statutory rate of 35 due principally to a lower rate incurred on foreign earnings and the favorable impact of the restructuring of certain legal entities 

during 2009 the company implemented an international restructuring in which it transferred the ownership of its canadian operations to its luxembourg holding company the transfer will allow the company to recover in a more tax efficient manner the earnings and booktotax basis differences attributable to our canadian investment as a result the company reduced the deferred tax liability related to our investment in canada 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for the three years ended december 31 2011 

 

 sources and uses of liquidity 

operating activities 

during 2011 net cash provided by operating activities was 449 million compared to 395 million in 2010 the 54 million yearoveryear increase is primarily the result of lower tax and restructuring payments this increase was partially offset by net increased uses of cash in working capital driven by spending to support increased sales volumes 

during 2010 net cash provided by operating activities increased by 25 million as compared to 2009 primarily attributable to a 88 million increase in net income excluding noncash increases in depreciation and amortization partially offset by a reduced source of cash from working capital 

  

investing activities 

cash used in investing activities was 423 million for 2011 compared to 1093 million in 2010 and 84 million in 2009 we invested 309 million related to the acquisition of ysi in 2011 and 385 million and 580 million related to the acquisitions of nova and godwin pumps respectively in 2010 capital expenditures in 2011 were 126 million compared to 94 million in 2010 and 62 million in 2009 the 32 million yearoveryear increase in capital expenditures in 2011 is primarily due to investments to increase productivity and the expansion of the godwin business 

financing activities 

during 2011 cash provided by financing activities was 172 million compared to cash provided by financing activities of 745 million in 2010 and cash used in financing activities of 292 million in 2009 the decline in 2011 is due to net transfers to our former parent itt as the net proceeds from the issuance of 12 billion aggregate amount of senior notes described below funded a net cash transfer to itt that included the repayment of funds used in the acquisition of ysi in general the components of net transfers include i cash transfers from the company to parent ii cash investments from our parent used to fund operations capital expenditures and acquisitions iii charges benefits for income taxes and iv allocations of the parent company’s corporate expenses described in this report dividends of 19 million were paid in 2011 no dividends were paid in 2010 and 2009 

funding and liquidity strategy 

prior to the spinoff the majority of our operations participated in us and international cash management and funding arrangements managed by itt where cash was swept from our balance sheet daily and cash to meet our operating and investing needs was provided as needed from itt transfers of cash both to and from these arrangements are reflected as a component of “parent company investment” in the consolidated and combined balance sheets the cash presented on our balance sheet prior to the spinoff consists primarily of us and international cash from subsidiaries that do not participate in these arrangements 

as a result of the separation our capital structure and sources of liquidity changed significantly we no longer participate in cash management and funding arrangements with itt instead our ability to fund our capital needs depends on our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access to the bank and capital markets 

historically we have generated operating cash flow sufficient to fund our primary cash needs centered on operating activities working capital capital expenditures and strategic investments subsequent to the separation while our ability to forecast future cash flows is more limited we expect to fund our ongoing working capital capital expenditures and financing requirements through cash flows from operations via access to cash on hand and capital markets if our cash flows from operations are less than we expect we may need to incur debt or issue equity from time to time we may need to access the longterm and shortterm capital markets to obtain financing our access to and the availability of financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors including i our credit ratings or absence of a credit rating ii the liquidity of the overall capital markets and iii the current state of the economy there can be no assurance that we will continue to have access to the capital markets on terms acceptable to us we cannot assure that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or that such financing will be available at all 

we anticipate that our present sources of funds including funds from operations and additional borrowings will provide us with sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet our liquidity and capital needs in both the united states and outside of the united states over the next twelve months 

on september 20 2011 we issued 12 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes of which 600 million aggregate principal amount of 355 senior notes will mature on september 20 2016 and 600 million aggregate principal amount of 4875 senior notes will mature on october 1 2021 the net proceeds of which funded a net cash transfer to itt in connection with the spinoff with the balance used for general corporate 

  

purposes the senior notes are our senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all our existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness the notes were initially guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by itt the guarantee terminated and was automatically and unconditionally released upon the distribution of the common stock of xylem to the holders of itt’s common stock in connection with the separation 

our credit ratings as of december 31 2011 are as follows 

 

 in connection with the spinoff as of october 31 2011 xylem and its subsidiaries entered into a four year competitive advance and revolving credit facility with jpmorgan chase bank na as agent and a syndicate of lenders the credit facility provides for an aggregate principal amount of up to 600 million of i a competitive advance borrowing option which will be provided on an uncommitted competitive advance basis through an auction mechanism the “competitive loans” ii revolving extensions of credit the “revolving loans” outstanding at any time and iii the issuance of letters of credits in a face amount not in excess of 100 million outstanding at any time as of december 31 2011 there were no borrowings under the credit facility 

for the years ended 2011 and 2010 we generated approximately 64 and 65 respectively of our revenue from nonus operations as we continue to grow our operations in the emerging markets and elsewhere outside of the united states we expect to continue to generate significant revenue from nonus operations and we expect our cash will be predominately held by our foreign subsidiaries we expect to manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed we may transfer cash from certain international subsidiaries to the us and other international subsidiaries when it is cost effective to do so our intent is to indefinitely reinvest all but 100 million of these funds outside of the united states however we continually review our domestic and foreign cash profile expected future cash generation and investment opportunities which support our current designation of these funds as being indefinitely reinvested and reassess whether there is a demonstrated need to repatriate funds held internationally to support our us operations if as a result of our review it is determined that all or a portion of the funds may be needed for our operations in the united states we would be required to accrue us taxes related to future tax payments associated with the repatriation of these funds as of december 31 2011 our foreign subsidiaries were holding 279 million in cash or marketable securities 

as of december 31 2011 our excess of financial reporting over the tax basis of investments in certain foreign subsidiaries totaled 16 billion we have not asserted that 100 million of our excess basis difference will be permanently reinvested and have therefore provided for united states or additional foreign withholding taxes for that portion generally such amounts become subject to us taxation upon the remittance of dividends and under certain other circumstances 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual commitments as of december 31 2011 

 

   

in addition to the amounts presented in the table above we have recorded liabilities for uncertain tax positions of 5 million these amounts have been excluded from the contractual obligations table due to an inability to reasonably estimate the timing of such payments in individual years 

 

  

  

  

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2011 we have issued guarantees for the debt and other obligations of consolidated subsidiaries we do not consider the maximum exposure to be material either individually or in the aggregate 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 

significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are discussed in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they are inherently uncertain involve significant judgments include areas where different estimates reasonably could have been used and changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable however actual results in these areas could differ from management’s estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured for product sales delivery does not occur until the products have been shipped risk of loss has been transferred to the customer and the contractual terms have been fulfilled in instances where contractual terms include a provision for customer acceptance revenue is recognized when either i we have previously demonstrated that the product meets the specified criteria based on either seller or customerspecified objective criteria or ii upon formal acceptance received from the customer where the product has not been previously demonstrated to meet customerspecified objective criteria revenue on service and repair contracts is recognized after services have been agreed to by the customer and rendered 

 

we enter into contracts to sell our products and services and while the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions certain agreements contain multiple elements or nonstandard terms and conditions where sales agreements contain multiple elements or nonstandard terms and conditions 

  

judgment is required to determine the appropriate accounting including whether the deliverables specified in these agreements should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes and if so how the transaction price should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize revenue for each element when a sale involves multiple deliverables the total revenue from the arrangement is allocated to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price of the deliverable to all other deliverables in the contract revenue for multiple element arrangements is recognized when the appropriate revenue recognition criteria for the individual deliverable have been satisfied the allocation of sales price between elements may impact the timing of revenue recognition but will not change the total revenue recognized on the arrangement for delivered elements accounted for as separate units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement revenue is recognized only when the delivered elements have standalone value there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance and there are no customernegotiated refund or return rights affecting the sales recognized 

certain businesses enter into longterm constructiontype sales contracts for which revenue is recognized under the percentageofcompletion method based upon percentage of costs incurred to total costs 

we record a reduction in revenue at the time of sale for estimated product returns rebates and other allowances based on historical experience and known trends 

warranty accrual accruals for estimated expenses related to warranties are made at the time products are sold or services are rendered and are recorded as a component of cost of revenue these accruals are established using historical information on the nature frequency and average cost of warranty claims and consider any factors that may cause differences in expected future warranty costs as compared to historical claim experience while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes we base our estimated warranty obligation on product warranty terms offered to customers ongoing product failure rates material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure as well as specific product class failures outside of our baseline experience we assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities quarterly and adjust amounts as necessary 

income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities applying enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences will reverse based on the evaluation of available evidence we recognize future tax benefits such as net operating loss carryforwards to the extent that we believe it is more likely than not we will realize these benefits we periodically assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets and reflect any changes to our estimate of the amount we are more likely than not to realize in the valuation allowance with a corresponding adjustment to earnings or other comprehensive income as appropriate 

in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we look to the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences taxable income in carryback years and the feasibility of tax planning strategies and estimated future taxable income the valuation allowance can be affected by changes to tax laws changes to statutory tax rates and changes to future taxable income estimates 

our effective tax rate reflects the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which we have not provided us taxes because we plan to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside the united states we plan foreign earnings remittance amounts based on projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and longterm investment requirements of our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic operations based on these assumptions we estimate the amount we will distribute to the united states and provide the us federal taxes due on these amounts material changes in our estimates of cash working capital and longterm investment requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we do business could impact our effective tax rate 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and to the extent to which additional taxes will be due furthermore we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on 

  

examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

we adjust our liability for uncertain tax positions in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional tax expense would result if a payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 

goodwill and intangible assets we review goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable we also review the carrying value of our finitelived intangible assets for potential impairment when impairment indicators arise we conduct our annual impairment test as of the first day of the fourth quarter we perform a twostep impairment test for goodwill in the first step we compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds its fair value then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to measure the impairment loss to be recorded if the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value then we record an impairment loss equal to the difference in our annual impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets we compare the fair value of those assets to their carrying value we recognize an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying value we estimate the fair value of our reporting units and intangible assets with indefinite lives using an income approach under the income approach we calculate fair value based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinitelived intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions particularly related to future operating results and cash flows these estimates and assumptions include but are not limited to revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates assumed royalty rates future economic and market conditions and identification of appropriate market comparable data in addition the identification of reporting units and the allocation of assets and liabilities to the reporting units when determining the carrying value of each reporting unit also require judgment goodwill is tested for impairment at either the operating segment identified in note 15 “industry segment and geographic data” to our notes to the consolidated financial statements or one level below the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets are based on estimates and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable significant changes to these estimates and assumptions could adversely impact our conclusions actual future results may differ from those estimates 

our 2011 annual goodwill impairment analysis indicated the estimated fair value of our reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying value and accordingly no impairment charges were recorded in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value estimates on the goodwill impairment test we applied a hypothetical 100 basis point increase to the discount rates utilized a ten percent reduction in expected future cash flows and reduced the assumed future growth rates of each reporting unit by 100 basis points these hypothetical changes did not result in any reporting unit failing step one of the impairment test further our 2011 annual indefinitelived intangible asset impairment test did not result in an impairment charge as the estimated fair value of the assets exceeded their carrying value 

postretirement plans prior to the spinoff employees who met certain eligibility requirements participated in various retirement plans administered by itt in connection with the spinoff we entered into a benefit and compensation matters agreement with itt whereby xylem agreed to adopt or assume sponsorship of certain defined benefit plans and replicate certain itt defined contribution plans to allow for continuation of those benefits under this agreement assets and liabilities attributable to xylem employees were transferred from itt to our qualified defined benefit and defined contribution plans 

  

  

company employees around the world participate in numerous defined benefit pension plans the determination of projected benefit obligations and the recognition of expenses related to these pension plans are dependent on various assumptions these major assumptions primarily relate to discount rates expected longterm rates of return on plan assets rate of future compensation increases mortality health care inflation and termination some of which are disclosed in note 12 “postretirement benefit plans” in the notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements and other factors actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and are amortized generally over the estimated future working life of the plan participants or for plans with all or substantially all inactive participants over the average remaining life expectancy 

significant assumptions 

management develops each assumption using relevant company experience in conjunction with marketrelated data for each individual country in which such plans exist all assumptions are reviewed annually with thirdparty consultants and adjusted as necessary the table included below provides the weighted average assumptions used to estimate our defined benefit pension obligations and costs as of and for the years ended 2011 and 2010 

 

  

 we determine the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets by evaluating both historical returns and estimates of future returns specifically the company analyzes the estimated future returns based on independent estimates of asset class returns and evaluates historical broad market returns over longterm timeframes based on the strategic asset allocation which is detailed in note 12 “postretirement benefit plans” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

based on the approach described above the chart below shows weighted average actual returns versus the weighted average expected longterm rates of return for our pension plans that were utilized in the calculation of the net periodic pension cost for each respective year 

 

  

 for the recognition of net periodic pension cost the calculation of the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is generally derived using a marketrelated value of plan assets based on average asset values at the measurement date over the last five years the use of fair value rather than a calculated value could materially affect net periodic pension cost our weighted average expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for all pension plans effective january 1 2012 is 742 we estimate that every 25 basis point change in the expected return on plan assets impacts the expense by 1 million 

the discount rate reflects our expectation of the present value of expected future cash payments for benefits at the measurement date a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense we base the discount rate assumption on current investment yields of highquality 

  

fixed income investments during the retirement benefits maturity period the pension discount rate was determined by considering an interest rate yield curve comprising aaaaa bonds with maturities between zero and thirty years developed by the plan’s actuaries annual benefit payments are then discounted to present value using this yield curve to develop a singlepoint discount rate matching the plan’s characteristics our weighted average discount rate for all pension plans effective january 1 2012 is 477 we estimate that every 25 basis point change in the discount rate impacts the expense by 1 million 

the rate of future compensation increase assumption reflects our longterm actual experience and future and nearterm outlook effective january 1 2012 our expected rate of future compensation is 365 for all pension plans the estimated impact of a 25 basis point change in the expected rate of future compensation is less than 1 million 

the assumed rate of future increases in the per capita cost of health care the health care trend rate is 74 for 2012 decreasing ratably to 5 in 2019 an increase or decrease in the health care trend rates by one percent per year would not have a material effect on the benefit obligation or the aggregate annual service and interest components to the extent that actual experience differs from these assumptions the effect will be amortized over the average future service of the covered active employees 

funded status 

funded status is derived by subtracting the respective yearend values of the projected benefit obligations from the fair value of plan assets we estimate that every 25 basis point change in the discount rate impacts the funded status by approximately 20 million 

fair value of plan assets 

the plan assets of our pension plans comprise a broad range of investments including domestic and foreign equity securities interests in private equity and hedge funds fixed income investments insurance contracts real estate and cash and cash equivalents 

a portion of our pension benefit plan assets portfolio comprises investments in private equity and hedge funds the private equity and hedge fund investments are generally measured at net asset value however in certain instances the values reported by the asset managers were not current at the measurement date accordingly we made estimate adjustments to the last reported value where necessary to measure the assets at fair value at the measurement date these adjustments consider information received from the asset managers as well as general market information there were no adjustments recorded for these assets at december 31 2011 asset values for other positions were generally measured using market observable prices we estimate that a 5 change in asset values will impact funded status by approximately 19 million 

new accounting pronouncements 

see note 2 “recently issued accounting pronouncements” in the notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements for a complete discussion of recent accounting pronouncements there were no new pronouncements which we expect to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations in future periods

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we are exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign currency exchange and interest rates these exposures are actively monitored by management our exposure to foreign exchange rate risk is due to certain costs revenues and borrowings being denominated in currencies other than one of our subsidiary’s functional currency similarly we are exposed to market risk as the result of changes in interest rates which may affect the cost of our financing it is our policy and practice to use derivative financial instruments only to the extent necessary to manage exposures 

  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

our foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to receipts from customers payments to suppliers and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies we may use derivative financial instruments to offset risk related to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers when it is believed that the exposure will not be limited by our normal operating and financing activities in january 2012 we began to periodically enter into currency forward contracts in order to manage the exchange rate fluctuation risk on certain intercompany transactions our principal currency exposures relate to the euro swedish krona british pound australian dollar canadian dollar polish zloty and hungarian forint we estimate that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would not be material to xylem’s financial position results of operations or cash flows 

interest rate risk 

as of december 31 2011 we do not have a material exposure to interest rate risk as our debt portfolio entirely comprises longterm fixedrate instruments we do not account for our longterm debt using the fair value option 

commodity price exposures 

portions of our business are exposed to volatility in the prices of certain commodities such as copper nickel and aluminum among others our primary exposure to this volatility resides with the use of these materials in purchased component parts we generally maintain longterm fixed price contracts on raw materials and component parts however we are prone to exposure as these contracts expire we estimate that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in prices for raw metal commodities would not be material to our financial position results of operations or cash flows

 item 9a controls and procedures tableend this annual report does not include a report of management’s assessment regarding internal control over financial reporting or an attestation report of the company’s registered public accounting firm due to a transition period established by the rules of the securities and exchange commission for newly public companies under the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission we are not required to comply with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 until we file our annual report on form 10k for our fiscal year ending december 31 2012 so long as we continue to meet the definition of a nonaccelerated filer in our annual report on form 10k for the year ending december 31 2012 management and our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to provide an assessment as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of december 31 2012 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

our management with the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the company have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the exchange act as of the end of the period covered by this report any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives based on such evaluation such officers have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report the company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

before the spinoff the company relied on certain financial information and resources of itt to manage certain aspects of the company’s business and report results these included investor relations corporate communications accounting tax legal human resources benefit plan administration benefit plan reporting general management real estate treasury insurance and risk management and oversight functions such as board of directors and internal audit which includes sarbanes oxley compliance in conjunction with the company’s separation from itt the company enhanced its own financial administrative and other support systems the company expanded its internal accounting reporting legal and internal audit departments and reformed its policies and systems as needed to meet all regulatory requirements on a standalone basis while most of these changes in staffing policies and systems were accomplished prior to december 31 2011 we continue to review document and test our internal controls over financial reporting and may from time to time make changes aimed at enhancing their effectiveness and to ensure that our systems evolve with our business these efforts may lead to changes in our internal control over financial reporting 

other than those noted above there were no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting during the year ended december 31 2011 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting
