 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form 10k each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition as well as the value of an investment in our common stock these risk factors do not identify all risks that we face our operations could also be affected by factors events or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we do not currently consider to present significant risks to our operations 

risks related to the covid19 pandemic 

the coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 pandemic resulted in a significant decrease in demand for many of our products and has had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business any future widespread health crises could materially and adversely impact our business in the future 

our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises and outbreaks of epidemics pandemics or contagious diseases such as covid19 the covid19 pandemic and the associated containment efforts had a serious adverse impact on the economy and a material adverse effect on our business particularly our refining segment during 2020 demand for crude oil gasoline jet fuel diesel fuel and other refined products was significantly reduced in the event government authorities impose any new mandatory closures workfromhome orders and social distancing protocols or other restrictions to mitigate the further spread of covid19 it is likely that demand for our products will again be impacted and our business will be negatively affected 

even if a virus or other illness does not spread significantly the perceived risk of infection or health risk may result in reduced demand for our products and materially affect our business as we cannot predict the duration or scope of covid19 or any pandemic the negative financial impact to our results cannot be reasonably estimated and could be material factors that will influence the impact on our business and operations include the duration and extent of the pandemic including the virulence and spread of different strains of a virus and the level and timing of vaccine development and distribution across the world and their impact on economic recovery and growth the extent of imposed or recommended containment and mitigation measures and their impact on our operations and the general economic consequences of the pandemic 

to the extent the covid19 pandemic or other widespread public health crises adversely affected or affects our business and financial results it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks that could adversely affect our business described below such as risks associated with industry capacity utilization volatility in the price and availability of raw materials material adverse changes in customer relationships including any failure of a customer to perform its obligations under agreements with us and risks associated with worldwide or regional economic conditions

risks related to our manufacturing and operations 

our financial results are affected by changing commodity prices and margins for refined petroleum petrochemical and plastics products 

our financial results are largely affected by the relationship or margin between the prices at which we sell refined petroleum petrochemical and plastics products and the prices for crude oil and other feedstocks used in manufacturing these products historically margins have been volatile and we expect they will continue to be volatile in the future 

the costs of feedstocks and the prices at which we can ultimately sell our products depend on numerous factors beyond our control including regional and global supply and demand which are subject to among other things production levels levels of refined petroleum product inventories productivity and growth of economies and governmental regulation we do not produce crude oil and must purchase all of the crude we process the prices for crude oil and refined petroleum products can fluctuate based on global regional and local market conditions as well as by type and class of products which can reduce margins and have a significant impact on our refining wholesale marketing and retail operations revenues operating income and cash flows also crude oil supply contracts generally have marketbased pricing provisions we normally purchase our refinery feedstocks weeks before manufacturing and selling the refined petroleum products we also purchase refined petroleum products produced by others for sale to our customers changes in prices that occur between the time we purchase feedstocks or products and when we sell the refined petroleum products could have a significant effect on our financial results 

the price of crude oil also influences prices for petrochemical and plastics products and the feedstocks used to manufacture the products our chemicals segment uses feedstocks that are derivatively produced in the refining of crude oil and the processing of natural gas and those feedstock prices can fluctuate widely for a variety of reasons including changes in worldwide energy prices and the supply and availability of the feedstocks due to the highly competitive nature of most of the products sold by our chemicals segment market position cannot necessarily be protected by product differentiation or by passing on cost increases to customers as a result price increases in raw materials may not correlate with changes in the prices at which petrochemical and plastics products are sold thereby negatively affecting margins and the results of operations of our chemicals segment 

market conditions including commodity prices may impact the earnings financial condition and cash flows of our midstream business 

our midstream business is affected by the price of and demand for crude oil natural gas and ngl which have historically been volatile the prices for crude oil natural gas and ngl depend upon factors beyond our control including global and local demand production levels imports and exports seasonality and weather conditions economic and political conditions domestically and internationally and governmental regulations decreases in energy prices can decrease drilling activity production rates and investments by third parties in the development of new crude oil and natural gas reserves sustained periods of low prices can also cause producers to significantly curtail or limit their oil and gas drilling operations which could substantially delay the production and delivery of volumes of crude oil natural gas and ngl 

the volume of crude oil and refined petroleum products transported or stored in our pipelines and terminal facilities depends on the demand for and availability of crude oil and refined petroleum products in the areas serviced by our assets a period of sustained low demand or prices for crude oil could lead to a decline in drilling activity and production which would lead to a decrease in the volumes of crude oil transported through our pipelines and terminal facilities negatively affecting our earnings and cash flows likewise our earnings and cash flows would be negatively impacted by a period of sustained lower demand for refined petroleum products which could lead to lower refinery utilization and result in a decrease in the volumes of refined petroleum product transported through our pipelines and terminal facilities 

index to financial statements 

the natural gas gathered processed transported sold and stored by dcp midstream is delivered into pipelines for further delivery to endusers including fractionation facilities demand for these services may be substantially reduced due to lower rates of natural gas production as a result of declining commodity prices commodity prices including when ethane prices are low relative to natural gas prices can also negatively impact throughput volumes of ngl transported fractionated and stored by dcp midstream additionally dcp midstream’s revenues and cash flows can increase or decrease as the price of natural gas and ngl fluctuates because of certain contractual arrangements whereby natural gas is purchased for an agreed percentage of proceeds from the sale of the residue gas andor ngl resulting from its processing activities 

additionally the level of production from natural gas wells will naturally decline over time in order to maintain or increase throughput levels on its gathering and transportation pipeline systems and ngl pipelines and the asset utilization rates at its natural gas processing plants dcp midstream must continually obtain new supplies the level of successful drilling activity and prices of and demand for natural gas and crude oil as well as producers’ desire and ability to obtain necessary permits are some of the factors that may affect new supplies of natural gas and ngl if dcp midstream is not able to obtain new supplies of natural gas to replace the natural decline in volumes from existing wells or because of competition throughput on its pipelines and the utilization rates of its treating and processing facilities would decline this could have a material adverse effect on its business results of operations financial position and cash flows and its ability to make cash distributions to us 

our operations are subject to planned and unplanned downtime business interruptions and operational hazards any of which could adversely impact our ability to operate and could adversely impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our operating results are largely dependent on the continued operation of facilities and assets owned and operated by us and our equity affiliates interruptions may materially reduce productivity and thus the profitability of operations during and after downtime including for planned turnarounds and scheduled maintenance activities in the past we and certain of our equity affiliates also have temporarily shut down facilities due to the threat of severe weather such as hurricanes although we take precautions to ensure and enhance the safety of our operations and minimize the risk of disruptions our operations are also subject to hazards inherent in chemicals refining and midstream businesses such as explosions fires refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents power outages labor disputes or other natural or manmade disasters such as geopolitical conflicts and acts of terrorism including cyber intrusion the inability to operate facilities or assets due to any of these events could significantly impair our ability to manufacture process store or transport products 

any casualty occurrence involving our assets or operations could result in serious personal injury or loss of human life significant damage to property and equipment environmental pollution impairment of operations and substantial losses to us for assets located near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers industrial sites and other public gathering areas the level of damage resulting from these risks could be greater damages resulting from an incident involving any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially substantial claims or in our being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities should any of these risks materialize at any of our equity affiliates it could have a material adverse effect on the business and financial condition of the equity affiliate and negatively impact their ability to make future distributions to us 

we are subject to interruptions of supply and offtake as well as increased costs as a result of our reliance on thirdparty transportation of crude oil ngl and refined petroleum products 

we often utilize the services of third parties to transport crude oil ngl and refined petroleum products to and from our facilities in addition to our own operational risks we could experience interruptions of supply or increases in costs to deliver refined petroleum products to market if the ability of the pipelines or vessels to transport crude oil or refined petroleum products is disrupted because of weather events accidents governmental regulations or thirdparty actions a prolonged disruption of the ability of a pipeline or vessel to transport crude oil ngl or refined petroleum products to or from one or more of our refineries or other facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

competition risks 

refining and marketing competitors that produce their own feedstocks have more extensive retail outlets or have greater financial resources may have a competitive advantage 

the refining and marketing industry is highly competitive with respect to both feedstock supply and refined petroleum product markets we compete with many companies for available supplies of crude oil and other feedstocks and for outlets for our refined petroleum products we do not produce any of our crude oil feedstocks some of our competitors however obtain a portion of their feedstocks from their own production and some have more extensive retail outlets than we have competitors that have their own production or extensive retail outlets and greater brandname recognition are at times able to offset losses from refining operations with profits from producing or retailing operations and may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages 

some of our competitors also have materially greater financial and other resources than we have such competitors have a greater ability to bear the economic risks inherent in all aspects of our business in addition we compete with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel requirements of our industrial commercial and individual customers 

market demand for transportation and midstream services and the risk of overbuild could negatively impact the results of operations of our midstream business 

we and our midstream equity affiliates compete with other pipelines and terminals that provide similar services in the same markets as our assets we compete on the basis of many factors including but not limited to rates service levels and offerings geographic location connectivity and reliability our competitors could construct new assets or redeploy existing assets in a manner that would result in more intense competition additionally we could be required to increase our costs or reduce the fees we charge in order to retain our customers 

we and our equity affiliates have made and continue to make significant investments in new infrastructure projects to meet market demand similar investments have been made and additional investments may be made in the future by us our competitors or by new entrants to the markets we serve the success of these investments largely depends on the realization of anticipated market demand and these projects typically require significant development periods during which time demand for such infrastructure may change or additional investments by competitors may be made any of these or other competitive forces could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial position or cash flows as well as our ability to pay cash distributions 

strategic performance and future growth risks 

large capital projects can take many years to complete and market conditions could deteriorate significantly between the project approval date and the project startup date negatively impacting expected project returns 

our basis for approving a largescale capital project is the expectation that it will deliver an acceptable rate of return on the capital invested we base these forecasted project economics on our best estimate of future market conditions including the regulatory and operating environment most largescale projects take several years to complete during this multiyear period market conditions can change from those we forecast and these changes could be significant accordingly we may not be able to realize our expected returns from a large investment in a capital project and this could negatively impact our results of operations cash flows and our return on capital employed 

index to financial statements 

plans we or our joint ventures may have to expand or construct assets and plans for our future performance are subject to risks associated with societal and political pressures and other forms of opposition to the future development transportation and use of carbonbased fuels such risks could adversely impact our results of operations 

certain of our plans are based upon the assumption that societal sentiment will continue to enable and existing regulations will remain in place to allow for the future development transportation and use of carbonbased fuels a portion of our growth strategy is dependent on our and our joint ventures’ ability to capture growth opportunities in the midstream and chemicals segments policy decisions relating to the production refining transportation marketing and use of carbonbased fuels are subject to political pressures and the influence and protests of environmental and other special interest groups for example the construction or expansion of pipelines can involve numerous regulatory environmental political and legal uncertainties many of which are beyond our control we may not be able to identify or execute growth projects and those that are identified may not be completed on schedule or at the budgeted cost in addition our revenues may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs could negatively impact our results of operations cash flows and our return on capital employed 

political and economic developments could affect our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows 

actions of federal state local and international governments through legislation or regulation executive order permit or other review of infrastructure or facility development and commercial restrictions could delay projects increase costs limit development or otherwise reduce our profitability both in the united states and abroad any such actions may affect many aspects of our operations including 

• requiring permits or other approvals that may impose unforeseen or unduly burdensome conditions or potentially cause delays in our operations 

• further limiting or prohibiting construction or other activities in environmentally sensitive or other areas 

• requiring increased capital costs to construct maintain or upgrade equipment facilities or infrastructure 

• restricting the locations where we may construct facilities or requiring the relocation of facilities 

in addition the us government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries and from doing business with entities affiliated with foreign governments which can include state oil companies and us subsidiaries of those companies the office of foreign assets control ofac of the us department of the treasury administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on us foreign policy and national security matters the effect of any such ofac sanctions could disrupt transactions with or operations involving entities affiliated with sanctioned countries and could limit our ability to obtain optimum crude slates and other refinery feedstocks and effectively distribute refined petroleum products 

other political and economic risks include global pandemics financial market turmoil economic volatility and global economic slowdown currency exchange rate fluctuations shortterm and longterm inflationary pressures import or export restrictions and changes in trade regulations supply chain disruptions acts of terrorism war civil unrest and other political risks limitations in the availability of labor to develop staff and manage operations and potentially adverse tax developments if any of these events occur our businesses and results of operations may be adversely affected 

index to financial statements 

we may not be able to effectively identify whether through acquisition investment or development lowercarbon opportunities on favorable terms or at all and failure to do so could limit our growth our ability to participate in the energy transition and our ability to meet our environmental goals and targets 

part of our strategy includes capturing growth opportunities in our emerging energy business to further advance our participation in the energy transition and meet our greenhouse gas ghg emissions reduction targets this strategy depends on our ability to successfully identify and evaluate acquisition and investment opportunities or develop and commercialize new technologies the number of lowercarbon opportunities may be limited and we will compete with other energy companies for these limited opportunities which could make them more expensive and the returns for our business less attractive and possibly cause us to refrain from making them at all further certain lowercarbon opportunities will depend on technological and other advancements that may not be within our control and may not come to fruition or be economically feasible in the near term any new opportunities also may depend on the viability of new assets or businesses that are contingent on public policy mechanisms including investment tax credits subsidies renewable portfolio standards and carbon trading plans these mechanisms have been implemented at the state and federal levels to support the development of renewable energy demandside and other clean infrastructure technologies the availability and continuation of public policy support mechanisms will drive a significant part of the economics and viability of lowercarbon and clean energy investments generally as well as our participation in them if we are unable to identify and consummate acquisitions and investments our ability to execute a portion of our growth strategy and meet our environmental goals may be impeded 

regulatory and environmental climate and weather risks 

climate change and severe weather may adversely affect our and our joint ventures’ facilities and ongoing operations 

the potential physical effects of climate change and severe weather on our operations are highly uncertain and depend upon the unique geographic and environmental factors present we have systems in place to manage potential acute physical risks including those that may be caused by climate change but if any such events were to occur they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations examples of potential physical risks include floods hurricaneforce winds wildfires freezing temperatures and snowstorms as well as rising sea levels at our coastal facilities we have incurred and will continue to incur costs to protect our assets from physical risks and to employ processes to the extent available to mitigate such risks 

we operate facilities located in coastal regions of the united states which have been impacted by hurricanes that have required us to temporarily or even permanently shut down operations at those sites due to significant damages from hurricane ida we shut down the alliance refinery in connection with plans to convert it to a terminal cpchem also operates facilities on the gulf coast and has had to temporarily shut down sites as a result of hurricanes any extreme weather events or rising sea levels may disrupt the ability to operate any facilities located near coastal areas or to transport crude oil refined petroleum or petrochemical and plastics products in these areas extended periods of such disruption could have an adverse effect on our results of operations we could also incur substantial costs to prevent or repair damage to these facilities finally depending on the severity and duration of any extreme weather events or climate conditions our operations may need to be modified and material costs incurred which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

there are certain environmental hazards and risks inherent in our operations that could adversely affect those operations and our financial results 

the operation of refineries power plants fractionators pipelines terminals and vessels is inherently subject to the risks of spills discharges or other inadvertent releases of petroleum or hazardous substances if any of these events had previously occurred or occurs in the future in connection with any of our refineries pipelines or refined petroleum products terminals or in connection with any facilities that receive our wastes or byproducts for treatment or disposal other than events for which we are indemnified we could be liable for all costs and penalties associated with their remediation under federal state local and international environmental laws or common law and could be liable for property damage to third parties caused by contamination from releases and spills 

index to financial statements 

we expect to continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of our compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations 

our business is subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment these laws and regulations continue to increase in both number and complexity and affect our operations with respect to among other things 

• the discharge of pollutants into the environment 

• emissions into the atmosphere such as nitrogen oxides sulfur dioxide and mercury emissions and ghg emissions as they are or may become regulated 

• the quantity of renewable fuels that must be blended into motor fuels 

• the handling use storage transportation disposal and cleanup of hazardous materials and hazardous and nonhazardous wastes 

• the dismantlement and abandonment of our facilities and restoration of our properties at the end of their useful lives 

to the extent these expenditures as with all costs are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in future periods could be materially adversely affected 

the adoption of climate change legislation or regulation could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the refined petroleum products we produce 

currently multiple legislative and regulatory measures to address ghg and other emissions are in various phases of consideration promulgation or implementation these include actions to develop international federal regional or statewide programs which could require reductions in our ghg or other emissions establish a carbon tax and decrease the demand for our refined products requiring reductions in these emissions could result in increased costs to i operate and maintain our facilities ii install new emission controls at our facilities and iii administer and manage any emissions programs including acquiring emission credits or allotments 

for example in 2017 the california state legislature adopted assembly bill 398 which provides direction and parameters on utilizing cap and trade after 2020 to meet the 40 reduction target for ghg emissions from 1990 levels by 2030 specified in senate bill 32 compliance with the cap and trade program is demonstrated through a marketbased credit system additionally the california air resources board is now exploring the potential for additional ghg reductions by 2045 via a yet undefined carbon neutrality standard and california’s governor has issued an executive order calling for a ban on the instate sales of new cars containing internal combustion engines beginning in 2035 other states are proposing or have already promulgated low carbon fuel standards or similar initiatives to reduce emissions from the transportation sector if we are unable to pass the costs of compliance on to our customers sufficient credits are unavailable for purchase we have to pay a significantly higher price for credits or if we are otherwise unable to meet our compliance obligation our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

federal regional and state climate change and air emissions goals and regulatory programs are complex subject to change and impose considerable uncertainty due to a number of factors including technological feasibility legal challenges and potential changes in federal policy increasing concerns about climate change and carbon intensity have also resulted in heightened societal awareness and a number of international and national measures to limit ghg emissions additional stricter regulatory measures and investor pressure can be expected in the future and any of these changes may have a material adverse impact on our business or financial condition

international climate changerelated efforts such as the 2015 united nations conference on climate change which led to the creation of the paris agreement may impact the regulatory framework of states whose policies directly influence our present and future operations although the united states had previously withdrawn from the paris agreement it has since taken the steps necessary to rejoin which was effective in february 2021 the us climate change strategy and the impact to our industry and operations due to ghg regulation is unknown at this time 

increased regulation of the fossil fuel industry particularly with respect to hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in us production of crude oil and natural gas which could adversely impact our results of operations 

most of the crude oil and gas production of our midstream segment’s customers is being produced from unconventional oil shale reservoirs these reservoirs require hydraulic fracturing completion processes to release the hydrocarbons from the rock so they can flow through casing to the surface hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water sand and chemicals under pressure into a formation to stimulate hydrocarbon production the epa as well as several state agencies have commenced studies andor convened hearings regarding the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities at the same time certain environmental groups have suggested that additional laws may be needed to more closely and uniformly regulate the hydraulic fracturing process and legislation has been proposed to provide for such regulation in addition some communities have adopted measures to ban hydraulic fracturing in their communities 

in addition certain interest groups have also proposed ballot initiatives and constitutional amendments designed to restrict crude oil and natural gas development generally if ballot initiatives local state or national restrictions or prohibitions are adopted and result in more stringent limitations on the production and development of crude oil and natural gas producers may experience delays or curtailment in the permitting or pursuit of exploration development or production activities 

if legislative and regulatory initiatives cause a material decrease in the drilling of new wells and related servicing activities it may reduce crude oil natural gas and ngl supplies negatively affecting the volume of products available to our midstream segment and increasing feedstock prices for our chemicals and refining segments resulting in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

compliance with the epa’s renewable fuel standard rfs could adversely affect our financial results 

the epa has implemented the rfs pursuant to the energy policy act of 2005 and the energy independence and security act of 2007 the rfs program sets annual renewable volume obligation rvo requirements for the quantity of renewable fuels such as ethanol that must be blended into motor fuels consumed in the united states to provide certain flexibility in compliance options available to the industry a renewable identification number rin is assigned to each gallon of renewable fuel produced in or imported into the united states as a producer of petroleumbased motor fuels we are obligated to blend renewable fuels into the products we produce at a rate that is at least commensurate to the epa’s rvo requirements and to the extent we do not we must purchase rins in the open market to satisfy our obligation under the rfs program 

we are exposed to the volatility in the market price of rins we cannot predict the future prices of rins rins prices are dependent upon a variety of factors including epa regulations the availability of rins for purchase and levels of transportation fuels produced which can vary significantly from quarter to quarter if sufficient rins are unavailable for purchase if we have to pay a significantly higher price for rins or if we are otherwise unable to meet the epa’s rvo requirements including because the epa mandates a blending quantity of renewable fuel that exceeds the amount that is commercially feasible to blend into motor fuel a situation commonly referred to as “the blend wall” our operations could be materially adversely impacted up to and including a reduction in produced motor fuel for sale in the united states 

index to financial statements 

societal technological political and scientific developments around emissions and fuel efficiency may decrease demand for transportation fuels 

developments aimed at reducing ghg emissions may decrease the demand or increase the cost for our transportation fuels societal attitudes toward these products and their relationship to the environment may significantly affect our effectiveness in marketing our products government efforts to steer the public toward nonpetroleumbased fuel dependent modes of transportation may foster a negative perception toward transportation fuels or increase costs of our products thus affecting the public’s attitude toward our major product advanced technology and increased use of vehicles that do not use petroleumbased transportation fuels or that are powered by hybrid engines would reduce demand for motor fuel we may also incur increased production costs which we may not be able to pass along to our customers 

additionally renewable fuels alternative energy mandates and energy conservation efforts could reduce demand for refined petroleum products tax incentives and other subsidies can make renewable fuels and alternative energy more competitive with refined petroleum products than they otherwise might be which may reduce refined petroleum product margins and hinder the ability of refined petroleum products to compete with renewable fuels 

these developments could potentially have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

continuing political and social concerns about the issues of climate change may result in changes to our business and significant expenditures including litigationrelated expenses 

increasing attention to global climate change has resulted in increased investor attention and an increased risk of public and private litigation which could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business for example shareholder activism has recently been increasing in our industry and shareholders may attempt to effect changes to our business or governance whether by shareholder proposals public campaigns proxy solicitations or otherwise additionally cities counties and other governmental entities in several states in the us began filing lawsuits against energy companies in 2017 including phillips 66 the lawsuits seek damages allegedly associated with climate change and the plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and abatement under various tort theories similar lawsuits may be filed in other jurisdictions we believe these lawsuits are an inappropriate vehicle to address the challenges associated with climate change and will vigorously defend against them for lacking factual and legal merit the ultimate outcome and impact to us of any such litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and we could incur substantial legal costs associated with defending these and similar lawsuits in the future additionally any of these risks could result in unexpected costs negative sentiments about our company disruptions in our operations increases to our operating expenses and reduced demand for our products which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

increased concerns regarding plastic waste in the environment consumers selectively reducing their consumption of plastic products due to recycling concerns or new or more restrictive regulations and rules related to plastic waste could reduce demand for cpchem’s plastic products and could negatively impact our equity interest 

there is a growing concern with the accumulation of plastic including microplastics and other packaging waste in the environment additionally plastics have recently faced increased public backlash and scrutiny policy measures to address this concern are being discussed or implemented by governments at all levels in addition a host of singleuse plastic bans and taxes have been passed by countries around the world and counties and municipalities throughout the us increased regulation of or prohibition on the use of certain plastic products could reduce demand for certain of the products cpchem produces which could negatively impact its financial condition results of operations and cash flows thereby negatively impacting our equity earnings and cash distributions that we receive from cpchem

cybersecurity and data privacy risks 

security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability which would cause our business and reputation to suffer 

our information technology and infrastructure or information technology and infrastructure of our thirdparty service providers eg cloudbased service providers may be vulnerable to attacks by malicious actors or breached due to human error malfeasance or other disruptions any such breaches could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in one or more of the following outcomes i a loss of intellectual property proprietary information or employee customer or vendor data ii public disclosure of sensitive information iii increased costs to prevent respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events such as deploying additional personnel and protection technologies training employees and engaging thirdparty experts and consultants iv systems interruption v disruption of our business operations vi remediation costs for repairs of system damage vii reputational damage that adversely affects customer or investor confidence and viii damage to our competitiveness stock price and longterm stockholder value although we have experienced occasional actual or attempted breaches of our cybersecurity we do not believe that any of these breaches has had a material effect on our business operations or financial condition 

a breach may also result in legal claims or proceedings against us by our shareholders employees customers vendors and governmental authorities us and nonus our infrastructure protection technologies and disaster recovery plans may not be able to prevent a technology systems breach or systems failure which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations furthermore the continuing and evolving threat of cyberattacks has resulted in increased regulatory focus on prevention to the extent we face increased regulatory requirements we may be required to expend significant additional resources to meet such requirements 

increasing regulatory focus on privacy and cybersecurity issues and expanding laws could expose us to increased liability subject us to lawsuits investigations and other liabilities and restrictions on our operations that could significantly and adversely affect our business 

along with our own data and information collected in the normal course of our business we and our partners collect and retain certain data that is subject to specific laws and regulations the transfer and use of this data both domestically and across international borders is becoming increasingly complex this data is subject to governmental regulation at the federal state international national provincial and local levels in many areas of our business including data privacy and security laws such as the european union eu general data protection regulation gdpr and the california consumer privacy act ccpa 

the gdpr applies to activities related to personal data that are conducted from an establishment in the eu as interpretation and enforcement of the gdpr evolves it creates a range of new compliance obligations which could cause us to incur additional costs failure to comply could result in significant penalties that may materially adversely affect our business reputation results of operations and cash flows 

the ccpa which came into effect on january 1 2020 gives california residents specific rights in relation to their personal information requires that companies take certain actions including notifications for security incidents and may apply to activities regarding personal information that is collected by us directly or indirectly from california residents as interpretation and enforcement of the ccpa evolves it creates a range of new compliance obligations with the possibility for significant financial penalties for noncompliance that may materially adversely affect our business reputation results of operations and cash flows 

the gdpr and ccpa as well as other data privacy laws that may become applicable to our business pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and potentially elevate our costs any failure by us to comply with these laws and regulations including as a result of a security or privacy breach could result in significant penalties and liabilities for us additionally if we acquire a company that has violated or is not in compliance with applicable data protection laws we may incur significant liabilities and penalties as a result

risks related to our joint ventures and our mlp 

our investments in joint ventures decrease our ability to manage risk 

we conduct some of our operations including parts of our midstream refining and marketing and specialities ms segments and our entire chemicals segment through joint ventures in which we share control with our joint venture partners our joint venture partners may have economic business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours or those of the joint venture or our joint venture participants may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone failure by us or an entity in which we have a joint venture interest to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisitions or joint ventures could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our joint ventures and in turn our business and operations 

one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of a publicly traded mlp phillips 66 partners which may involve a greater exposure to legal liability than our historic business operations including with respect to the pending acquisition by us of all of the publicly held limited partner interests in phillips 66 partners the merger 

one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of phillips 66 partners a publicly traded mlp our control of the general partner of phillips 66 partners may increase the possibility that we could be subject to claims of breach of fiduciary duties including claims of conflicts of interest related to phillips 66 partners 

additionally our directors and officers as well as the directors and officers of the general partner of phillips 66 partners could be subject to lawsuits relating to the merger such litigation is very common in connection with acquisitions of public companies regardless of the merits related to the underlying acquisition while we will evaluate and defend against any actions vigorously the costs of the defense of such lawsuits and other effects of such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our future business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

indebtedness capital markets and financial risks 

uncertainty and illiquidity in credit and capital markets can impair our ability to obtain credit and financing on acceptable terms and can adversely affect the financial strength of our business partners 

our ability to obtain credit and capital depends in large measure on the state of the credit and capital markets which is beyond our control our ability to access credit and capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like or need access to those markets which could constrain our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions in addition the cost and availability of debt and equity financing may be adversely impacted by unstable or illiquid market conditions protracted uncertainty and illiquidity in these markets also could have an adverse impact on our lenders commodity transaction counterparties or our customers preventing them from meeting their obligations to us 

from time to time our cash needs may exceed our cash from our consolidated operations and joint venture distributions and our business could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to obtain necessary funds from financing activities from time to time we may need to supplement cash generated from operations with proceeds from financing activities uncertainty and illiquidity in financial markets may materially impact the ability of the participating financial institutions to fund their commitments to us under our liquidity facilities that are supported by a broad syndicate of financial institutions accordingly we may not be able to obtain the full amount of the funds available under our liquidity facilities to satisfy our cash requirements and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position

investor sentiment towards climate change fossil fuels and sustainability could adversely affect our business the market price for our common stock and our access to capital markets 

there have been efforts in recent years aimed at the investment community including investment advisors sovereign wealth funds public pension funds universities and other groups to promote the divestment of energy companies as well as to pressure lenders and other financial services companies to limit or curtail activities with energy companies if these efforts are successful our stock price and our ability to access capital markets may be negatively impacted 

members of the investment community are also increasing their focus on sustainability practices including practices related to ghg and climate change in the energy industry as a result we may face increasing pressure regarding our sustainability disclosures and practices additionally members of the investment community may screen companies such as ours for sustainability performance before investing in our stock or participating in our financing activities 

if we are unable to meet the sustainability standards set by these investors we may lose investors our stock price may be negatively impacted our access to capital markets and lenders may be curtailed and our reputation may be negatively affected 

we do not fully insure against all potential losses including those from extreme weather events and therefore our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by unexpected or underinsured liabilities and increased costs 

we maintain insurance coverage in amounts we believe to be prudent including against many but not all potential liabilities arising from operating hazards uninsured or underinsured liabilities arising from operating hazards including but not limited to explosions fires refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents involving our assets or operations including climaterelated weather events could reduce the funds available to us for capital and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

deterioration in our credit profile could increase our costs of borrowing money limit our access to the capital markets and commercial credit and could trigger coventurer rights under joint venture arrangements 

our or phillips 66 partners’ credit ratings could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment the circumstances warrant if a rating agency were to downgrade our rating below investment grade our or phillips 66 partners’ borrowing costs would increase and our funding sources could decrease in addition a failure by us to maintain an investment grade rating could affect our business relationships with suppliers and operating partners for example our agreement with chevron corporation chevron regarding cpchem permits chevron to buy our 50 interest in cpchem for fair market value if we experience a change in control or if both standard  poor’s financial services llc and moody’s investors service inc lower our credit ratings below investment grade and the credit rating from either rating agency remains below investment grade for 365 days thereafter with fair market value determined by agreement or by nationally recognized investment banks as a result of these factors a downgrade of credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our future operations and financial position 

the level of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the expected return on plan assets for our pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans are evaluated by us based on a variety of independent sources of market information and in consultation with outside actuaries if we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected longterm rate of return or health care cost trend rate our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses and funding requirements could increase in addition several factors could cause actual results to differ significantly from the actuarial assumptions that we use funding obligations are determined based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date as required under relevant regulations future pension funding requirements and the timing of funding payments could be affected by legislation enacted by governmental authorities

we may incur losses as a result of our forward contracts and derivative transactions 

we currently use commodity derivative instruments and we expect to use them in the future if the instruments we utilize to hedge our exposure to various types of risk are not effective we may incur losses derivative transactions involve the risk that counterparties may be unable to satisfy their obligations to us the risk of counterparty default is heightened in a poor economic environment 

continuing risks related to spinoff from conocophillips 

we are subject to continuing contingent liabilities of conocophillips following the separation further conocophillips has indemnified us for certain matters but may not be able to satisfy its obligations to us in the future 

in connection with our separation from conocophillips we entered into an indemnification and release agreement and certain other agreements pursuant to which conocophillips agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities and we agreed to indemnify conocophillips for certain liabilities indemnities that we may be required to provide are not subject to any cap and may be significant third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that conocophillips has agreed to retain further the indemnity from conocophillips may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities and conocophillips may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations each of these risks could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition

executive overview and business environment 

phillips 66 is an energy manufacturing and logistics company with midstream chemicals refining and marketing and specialties businesses at december 31 2021 we had total assets of 556 billion 

executive overview 

we reported earnings of 13 billion and generated 60 billion in cash from operating activities for the full year of 2021 during 2021 we used available cash to fund capital expenditures and investments of 19 billion pay dividends on our common stock of 16 billion and pay down 15 billion in debt we ended 2021 with 31 billion of cash and cash equivalents and approximately 57 billion of total committed capacity available under our credit facilities 

our reported earnings for 2021 continued to reflect the ongoing impacts of the disruption to global economic activities caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 pandemic primarily on our refining segment however through 2021 global refined petroleum product demand steadily recovered due to the easing of pandemic restrictions and the administration of covid19 vaccines consequently margins and utilization for our refining segment margins and sales volumes for our marketing and specialities ms segment and throughput volumes for our transportation business improved in addition equity earnings from our chemicals segment increased significantly due to higher margins driven by strong demand and tight product supply however as uncertainty remains regarding the ongoing impact of the pandemic on the global economy we will continue to be disciplined in our allocation of capital and monitor the performance of our portfolio 

in 2021 we progressed strategic initiatives to position phillips 66 for a lowercarbon future as a part of our commitment to play an important role in addressing climate change in september 2021 we announced a set of companywide greenhouse gas ghg emission intensity reduction targets that we consider to be impactful attainable and measurable by 2030 we expect to reduce ghg emission intensity by 30 for scope 1 and 2 emissions from our operations and by 15 for scope 3 emissions from our energy products below 2019 levels also in september 2021 we acquired a 16 interest in novonix limited novonix a company that develops technology and supplies materials for lithiumion batteries 

in october 2021 we entered into a definitive merger agreement with phillips 66 partners to acquire all of the limited partner interests in phillips 66 partners not already owned by us on the closing date of the transaction the agreement provides for an allstock transaction in which each outstanding phillips 66 partners common unitholder would receive 050 shares of phillips 66 common stock for each phillips 66 partners common unit phillips 66 partners’ perpetual convertible preferred units would be converted into common units at a premium to the original issuance price prior to exchange for phillips 66 common stock this merger is expected to close in march 2022 subject to customary closing conditions upon closing phillips 66 partners will become a wholly owned subsidiary of phillips 66 and will no longer be a publicly traded partnership see note 27—phillips 66 partners lp in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the pending merger transaction 

index to financial statements 

we continue to focus on the following strategic priorities

• growth a disciplined capital allocation process ensures we invest in projects that are expected to generate competitive returns our strategy primarily focuses on investing in returnsfocused growth opportunities in the midstream and chemicals segments as well as our investments in renewable fuels projects to advance a lowercarbon future in 2022 we have budgeted 426 million in growth capital for our midstream segment which includes construction completion of frac 4 at the sweeny hub in chemicals our share of expected selffunded growth capital spending by chevron phillips chemical company llc cpchem is 502 million cpchem plans to use its growth capital to fund expansion of its normal alpha olefins production optimization and debottleneck opportunities in the olefins and polyolefins chains as well as continuing development of petrochemicals projects in the us gulf coast and qatar in refining we have budgeted 408 million of growth capital primarily for the reconfiguration of the san francisco refinery in rodeo california to a renewable fuels production facility as part of the rodeo renewed project 

• returns we plan to enhance refining returns by increasing throughput of advantaged feedstocks improving yields optimizing our portfolio and remaining committed to operating excellence for 2022 our ms segment will continue to develop and enhance our retail network including energy transition opportunities 

• distributions we believe shareholder value is enhanced through among other things a secure competitive and growing dividend complemented by share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2021 we increased our quarterly dividend by 2 to 092 per common share regular dividends demonstrate the confidence our board of directors and management have in our capital structure and operations’ capability to generate free cash flow throughout the business cycle we suspended our share repurchase program in march 2020 to preserve liquidity as operating cash flows improve further we will prioritize shareholder returns and debt repayment

business environment 

the midstream segment includes our transportation and ngl businesses our transportation business contains feebased operations not directly exposed to commodity price risk our ngl business contains both feebased operations and operations directly impacted by ngl prices the midstream segment also includes our 50 equity investment in dcp midstream during 2021 ngl prices increased significantly compared with 2020 due to strong demand as economic activities gradually recovered following the administration of covid19 vaccines and the easing of pandemic restrictions 

the chemicals segment consists of our 50 equity investment in cpchem the chemicals and plastics industry is mainly a commoditybased industry where the margins for key products are based on supply and demand as well as cost factors compared with 2020 the benchmark highdensity polyethylene chain margin increased significantly in 2021 due to continued strong demand and tight supply 

our refining segment results are driven by several factors including market crack spreads refinery throughput feedstock costs product yields turnaround activity and other operating costs the price of us benchmark crude oil west texas intermediate wti at cushing oklahoma increased to an average of 6796 per barrel during 2021 compared with an average of 3931 per barrel in 2020 market crack spreads are used as indicators of refining margins and measure the difference between market prices for refined petroleum products and crude oil worldwide market crack spreads increased to an average of 1709 per barrel during 2021 compared with an average of 833 per barrel in 2020 the increases in crude oil prices and market crack spreads were primarily driven by a significant increase in demand for refined petroleum products as economic activities gradually recovered following the administration of covid19 vaccines and the easing of pandemic restrictions as well as tightening supply in 2021 renewable identification number rin prices increased significantly compared with 2020 

results for our ms segment depend largely on marketing fuel and lubricant margins and sales volumes of our refined petroleum and other specialty products while marketing fuel and lubricant margins are primarily driven by market factors largely determined by the relationship between supply and demand marketing fuel margins in particular are influenced by trends in spot prices and where applicable retail prices for refined petroleum products in the regions and countries where we operate in general a downward trend of spot prices has a favorable impact on marketing fuel margins while an upward trend of spot prices has an unfavorable impact on marketing fuel margins the global disruption caused by the covid19 pandemic resulted in reduced demand for refined petroleum and specialty products since march 2020 following the administration of covid19 vaccines in 2021 and the easing of pandemic restrictions demand for refined petroleum and specialty products improved in 2021 compared with 2020

net loss attributable to phillips 66 for the year ended december 31 2020 was 3975 million compared with net income attributable to phillips 66 of 3076 million for the year ended december 31 2019 the decrease was mainly attributable to

• a longlived asset impairment associated with our plan to reconfigure the san francisco refinery into a renewable fuels production facility which impacted our refining and midstream segments 

• higher impairments of equity investments in our midstream segment

the refining segment refines crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products such as gasoline distillates and aviation fuels as well as renewable fuels at 12 refineries in the united states and europe our alliance refinery sustained significant impacts from hurricane ida in august 2021 and in the fourth quarter of 2021 we announced the shutdown of the refinery in connection with plans to convert it to a terminal 

2021 vs 2020 

results from the refining segment increased 3606 million in 2021 compared with 2020 the improved results in 2021 were primarily due to higher realized refining margins and lower asset impairments partially offset by increased utility expenses and higher costs related to the shutdown of our alliance refinery the improved realized refining margins in 2021 were mainly attributable to increased market crack spreads partially offset by higher rin costs lower clean product differentials and decreased secondary products margins 

our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 84 and 76 in 2021 and 2020 respectively the increase in 2021 was primarily driven by improved market demand for refined petroleum products following the administration of covid19 vaccines and the easing of pandemic restrictions 

see note 9—impairments in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding impairments recorded in our refining segment during 2021 and 2020

index to financial statements 

2020 vs 2019 

results from the refining segment decreased 8141 million in 2020 compared with 2019 the decreased results in 2020 were due to 

• lower realized refining margins and decreased refinery production a sharp decline in demand for refined petroleum products resulting from global economic disruption caused by the covid19 pandemic led to lower market crack spreads and reduced refinery production in 2020 in addition hurricane impacts contributed to the lower refinery production in the gulf coast region in 2020 

• a beforetax longlived asset impairment of 910 million in the third quarter of 2020 associated with our plan to reconfigure the san francisco refinery into a renewable fuels production facility 

• a beforetax goodwill impairment of 1845 million in the first quarter of 2020 

our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 76 and 94 in 2020 and 2019 respectively the lower utilization rate in 2020 was primarily due to reduced refining runs driven by lower demand for refined petroleum products as a result of the covid19 pandemic as well as hurricane impacts in the gulf coast region

2021 vs 2020 

beforetax income from the ms segment increased 363 million in 2021 compared with 2020 the increase in 2021 was primarily driven by higher realized us marketing fuel margins and increased equity earnings from excel due to improved base oil margins partially offset by lower realized international marketing fuel margins 

see the “executive overview and business environment” section for information on marketing fuel margins and other market factors impacting 2021 results 

2020 vs 2019 

beforetax income from the ms segment increased 13 million in 2020 compared with 2019 the increase was primarily attributable to higher realized marketing fuel margins partially offset by lower sales volumes for refined petroleum and specialty products driven by decreased demand

2021 vs 2020 

net interest expense increased 98 million in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily driven by lower capitalized interest due to the completion of capital projects and the placement of assets into service and higher average debt principal balances reflecting debt issuances in the second and fourth quarters of 2020 as well as costs associated with early debt retirement in 2021 see note 12—debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the debt issuances in 2020 and debt repayment in 2021

capital resources and liquidity 

financial indicators 



to meet our short and longterm liquidity requirements we use a variety of funding sources but rely primarily on cash generated from operating activities and debt financing during 2021 we generated 60 billion in cash from operations we used available cash to fund capital expenditures and investments of 19 billion pay dividends on our common stock of 16 billion pay down 15 billion in debt and fund an additional member loan to an equity affiliate of 310 million during 2021 cash and cash equivalents increased 633 million to 31 billion 

significant sources of capital 

operating activities 

during 2021 cash generated by operating activities was 60 billion a 39 billion increase compared with 2020 the increase was primarily due to improved realized refining margins a us federal income tax refund of 11 billion received in the second quarter of 2021 and higher cash distributions from our equity affiliates partially offset by higher operating expenses 

during 2020 cash generated by operating activities was 21 billion a 56 decrease compared with 2019 the decrease was primarily due to lower realized refining margins driven by the global economic disruption caused by the covid19 pandemic partially offset by lower cash income taxes paid 

our short and longterm operating cash flows are highly dependent upon refining and marketing margins ngl prices and chemicals margins prices and margins in our industry are typically volatile and are driven by market conditions over which we have little or no control absent other mitigating factors as these prices and margins fluctuate we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows 

the level and quality of output from our refineries also impact our cash flows factors such as operating efficiency maintenance turnarounds market conditions feedstock availability and weather conditions can affect output we actively manage the operations of our refineries and any variability in their operations typically has not been as significant to cash flows as that caused by margins and prices our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization was 84 76 and 94 in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively our worldwide refining clean product yield was 83 84 and 84 in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

equity affiliate operating distributions 

our operating cash flows are also impacted by distribution decisions made by our equity affiliates including cpchem over the three years ended december 31 2021 our operating cash flows included aggregate distributions from our equity affiliates of 6285 million including 3101 million from cpchem we cannot control the amount or timing of future distributions from equity affiliates therefore future distributions are not assured

contingencies 

a number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims that arose in the ordinary course of business have been filed against us or are subject to indemnifications provided by us we also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement storage disposal or release of certain chemical mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites we regularly assess the need for financial recognition or disclosure of these contingencies in the case of all known contingencies other than those related to income taxes we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable if a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount then the minimum of the range is accrued we do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or thirdparty recoveries if applicable we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other thirdparty recoveries in the case of income taxrelated contingencies we use a cumulative probabilityweighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is uncertain 

based on currently available information we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements as we learn new facts concerning contingencies we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include contingent liabilities recorded for environmental remediation tax and legal matters estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other potentially responsible parties estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes 

legal and tax matters 

our legal and tax matters are handled by our legal and tax organizations these organizations apply their knowledge experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases and uncertain tax positions we employ a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases and enables the tracking of those cases that have been scheduled for trial andor mediation based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals or establishment of new accruals is required in the case of income taxrelated contingencies we monitor tax legislation and court decisions the status of tax audits and the statute of limitations within which a taxing authority can assert a liability see note 21—income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about income taxrelated contingencies

• us federal clean water act which governs discharges into water bodies 

• european union regulation for registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals reach which governs production marketing and use of chemicals 

• us federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla which imposes liability on generators transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur 

• us federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra which governs the treatment storage and disposal of solid waste 

• us federal emergency planning and community righttoknow act epcra which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories to local emergency planning committees and response departments 

• us federal oil pollution act of 1990 opa90 under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines as well as owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of crude oil into navigable waters of the united states 

• european union trading directive resulting in the european union emissions trading scheme eu ets which uses a marketbased mechanism to incentivize the reduction of greenhouse gas ghg emissions as well as the united kingdom emissions trading scheme uk ets which replaced the eu ets in the united kingdom on january 1 2021 but the united kingdom had the obligation and retained the ability to enforce the eu ets obligations until april 30 2021 

these laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and in the case of discharges to water establish water quality limits they also in most cases require permits in association with new or modified operations these permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process which can be expensive and time consuming in addition there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency’s processing of the application many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant 

other foreign countries and many states where we operate also have or are developing similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities while similar in some cases these regulations may impose additional or more stringent requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of developing infrastructure and marketing and transporting products across state and international borders for example in california the south coast air quality management district scaqmd approved amendments to the regional clean air incentives market reclaim that became effective in 2016 which require a phased reduction of nitrogen oxide emissions through 2022 affecting refineries in the los angeles metropolitan area in 2017 scaqmd required additional nitrogen dioxide emissions reductions through 2025 and on november 5 2021 promulgated new regulations to replace the reclaim program with a traditional command and control regulatory regime 

the ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards such as air emission standards water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations continue to evolve however environmental laws and regulations including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the united states and in other countries in which we operate notable areas of potential impacts include air emissions compliance and remediation obligations in the united states

an example of this in the fuels area is the energy independence and security act of 2007 eisa it requires fuel producers and importers to provide additional renewable fuels for transportation motor fuels and stipulates a mix of various types rins form the mechanism used by the epa to record compliance with the renewable fuel standard rfs if an obligated party has more rins than it needs to meet its obligation it may sell or trade the extra rins or instead choose to “bank” them for use the following year we have met the requirements to date while establishing implementation operating and capital strategies along with advanced technology development to address projected future renewable volume obligation rvo requirements on december 7 2021 the epa proposed rvo for the 2021 and 2022 compliance years which essentially holds the 2021 rvo to actual volumes of biofuel consumption while increasing the volumes in 2022 the epa also reproposed the compliance year 2020 rvo also holding them to actual volumes it is uncertain how various future rvo requirements contained in eisa and the regulations promulgated thereunder may be implemented and what their full impact may be on our operations additionally we may experience a decrease in demand for refined petroleum products due to the regulatory program as currently promulgated this program continues to be the subject of possible congressional review and repromulgation in revised form and the epa’s final regulations establishing rvo requirements have been and continue to be subject to legal challenge further creating uncertainty regarding rvo requirements compliance with the regulation has been further complicated as the market for rins has been the subject of fraudulent thirdparty activity and it is possible that some rins that we have purchased may be determined to be invalid should that occur we could incur costs to replace those fraudulent rins although the cost for replacing any fraudulently marketed rins is not reasonably estimable at this time we would not expect such costs to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

we are required to purchase rins in the open market to satisfy the portion of our obligation under the rfs that is not fulfilled by blending renewable fuels into the motor fuels we produce for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 we incurred expenses of 441 million 342 million and 111 million respectively associated with our obligation to purchase rins in the open market to comply with the rfs for our wholly owned refineries these expenses are included in the “purchased crude oil and products” line item on our consolidated statement of operations our jointly owned refineries also incurred expenses associated with the purchase of rins in the open market of which our share was 351 million 133 million and 74 million for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively these expenses are included in the “equity in earnings of affiliates” line item on our consolidated statement of operations the amount of these expenses and fluctuations between periods is primarily driven by the market price of rins refinery production blending activities and rvo requirements 

we also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations such laws and regulations include cercla and rcra and their state equivalents remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility arising from petroleum releases from underground storage tanks located at numerous previously and currently owned andor operated petroleummarketing outlets throughout the united states federal and state laws require contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards in addition to other cleanup standards many states have adopted cleanup criteria for methyl tertiarybutyl ether mtbe for both soil and groundwater and both the epa and many states may adopt cleanup standards for per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas which may have been a constituent in certain firefighting foams used or stored at or near some of our facilities 

at rcrapermitted facilities we are required to assess environmental conditions if conditions warrant we may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations in contrast to cercla which is often referred to as “superfund” the cost of corrective action activities under rcra corrective action programs typically is borne solely by us we anticipate increased expenditures for rcra remediation activities may be required but such annual expenditures for the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures we have experienced over the past few years longerterm expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly 

we occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the epa and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under cercla or an equivalent state statute on occasion we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties these requests notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations as of december 31 2020 we reported that we had been notified of potential liability under cercla and comparable state laws at 25 sites within the united states during 2021 there were no new sites for which we received notice of potential liability nor were any existing sites deemed resolved and closed leaving 25 unresolved sites with potential liability at december 31 2021 

index to financial statements 

for the majority of superfund sites our potential liability will be less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties is relatively low although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations and where they have not or where potentially responsible parties could not be located our share of liability has not increased materially many of the sites for which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the epa or the state agencies concerned prior to actual cleanup those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation in some instances we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain the epa or equivalent state agency approval of a remediation plan there are relatively few sites where we are a major participant and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all cercla sites in the aggregate is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition 

we incur costs related to the prevention control abatement or elimination of environmental pollution expensed environmental costs were 726 million in 2021 and are expected to be approximately 725 million and 775 million in 2022 and 2023 respectively capitalized environmental costs were 96 million in 2021 and are expected to be approximately 115 million and 165 million in 2022 and 2023 respectively these amounts do not include capital expenditures made for other purposes that have an indirect benefit on environmental compliance 

accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted except those assumed in a business combination which we record on a discounted basis 

many of these liabilities result from cercla rcra and similar state laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct or once conducted operations or at sites where our generated waste was disposed we also have accrued for a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation but which are not currently the subject of cercla rcra or state enforcement activities if applicable we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other thirdparty recoveries in the future we may incur significant costs under both cercla and rcra remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site depending on the mix of unique site characteristics evolving remediation technologies diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties therefore it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs 

notwithstanding any of the foregoing and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in certain of our operations and products and there can be no assurance that those costs and liabilities will not be material however we currently do not expect any material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations 

climate change 

there has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state national and international laws focusing on ghg emissions reduction including various regulations proposed or issued by the epa these proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in states andor countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future laws regulating ghg emissions continue to evolve and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation such laws potentially could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition as a result of increasing costs of compliance lengthening project implementation and agency reviews or reducing demand for certain hydrocarbon products examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include 

  

• eu ets which is part of the european union’s policy to combat climate change and is a key tool for reducing industrial ghg emissions eu ets impacts factories power stations and other installations across all eu member states as a result of the united kingdom’s exit from the european union brexit those types of entities in the united kingdom became subject to the uk ets rather than the eu ets after the eu ets 2020 scheme year ended on april 30 2021

• california’s senate bill no 32 which requires reduction of californias ghg emissions to 40 below the 1990 emission level by 2030 and assembly bill 398 which extends the california ghg emission cap and trade program through 2030 other ghg emissions programs in the western us states have been enacted or are under consideration or development including amendments to californias low carbon fuel standard oregons low carbon fuel standard and climate protection plan and washingtons carbon reduction programs 

• the us supreme court decision in massachusetts v epa  549 us 497 127 s ct 1438 2007 confirming that the epa has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an “air pollutant” under the federal clean air act 

• the epa’s announcement on march 29 2010 published as “interpretation of regulations that determine pollutants covered by clean air act permitting programs” 75 fed reg 17004 april 2 2010 and the epa’s and us department of transportation’s joint promulgation of a final rule on april 1 2010 that triggers regulation of ghgs under the clean air act these collectively may lead to more climatebased claims for damages and may result in longer agency review time for development projects to determine the extent of potential climate change 

• the epas 2015 final rule regulating ghg emissions from existing fossil fuelfired electrical generating units under the federal clean air act commonly referred to as the clean power plan the epa commenced rulemaking in 2017 to rescind the clean power plan and in august 2018 the epa proposed the affordable clean energy ace rule as its replacement on january 19 2021 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia invalidated the ace rule and remanded the matter to the epa essentially restarting this rulemaking process 

• carbon taxes in certain jurisdictions 

• ghg emission cap and trade programs in certain jurisdictions 

in the eu the first phase of the eu ets completed at the end of 2007 phase ii was undertaken from 2008 through 2012 and phase iii ran from 2013 through to 2020 phase iv runs from january 1 2021 through 2030 and sectors covered under the ets must reduce their ghg emissions by 43 compared to 2005 levels since january 1 2021 the united kingdom is no longer part of the eu ets and instead has been under the uk ets however the united kingdom had the obligation and retained the ability to enforce the eu ets obligations until april 30 2021 phillips 66 has assets that are subject to the eu ets and assets that are subject to the uk ets 

from november 30 to december 12 2015 more than 190 countries including the united states participated in the united nations climate change conference in paris france the conference culminated in what is known as the “paris agreement” which upon certain conditions being met entered into force on november 4 2016 the paris agreement establishes a commitment by signatory parties to pursue domestic ghg emission reductions in 2017 president trump announced his intention to withdraw the united states from the paris agreement and that withdrawal became effective on november 4 2020 on january 20 2021 president biden signed the “acceptance on behalf of the united states of america” which allows the united states to rejoin the paris agreement the united states officially rejoined the paris agreement in february 2021 which could lead to additional ghg emission reduction requirements for sources in the united states 

in the united states some additional form of regulation is likely to be forthcoming at the state or federal levels with respect to ghg emissions such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in additional financial burden in the form of taxes the restriction of output investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances 

compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a ghg emission trading program ghg reduction requirements or carbon taxes could significantly increase our costs reduce demand for fossil energy derived products impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources 

index to financial statements 

an example of one such program is california’s cap and trade program which was promulgated pursuant to the state’s global warming solutions act the program had been limited to certain stationary sources which include our refineries in california but beginning in january 2015 was expanded to include emissions from transportation fuels distributed in california inclusion of transportation fuels in california’s cap and trade program as currently promulgated has increased our cap and trade program compliance costs the ultimate impact on our financial performance either positive or negative from this and similar programs will depend on a number of factors including but not limited to 

• whether and to what extent legislation or regulation is enacted 

• the nature of the legislation or regulation such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions 

• the ghg reductions required 

• the price and availability of offsets 

• the demand for and amount and allocation of allowances 

• technological and scientific developments leading to new products or services 

• any potential significant physical effects of climate change such as increased severe weather events changes in sea levels and changes in temperature 

• whether and the extent to which increased compliance costs are ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services 

we consider and take into account anticipated future ghg emissions in designing and developing major facilities and projects and implement energy efficiency initiatives to reduce ghg emissions data on our ghg emissions legal requirements regulating such emissions and the possible physical effects of climate change on our coastal assets are incorporated into our planning investment and risk management decisionmaking we are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations 

in september 2021 we announced a set of companywide ghg emission intensity reduction targets that we consider to be impactful attainable and measurable by 2030 we expect to reduce ghg emission intensity by 30 for scope 1 and 2 emissions from our operations and by 15 for scope 3 emissions from our energy products below 2019 levels 

in addition to the disclosures above we have issued our 2021 sustainability report that is accessible on our website and provides more detailed information on our environmental social and corporate governance esg initiatives including detailed information on environmental metrics

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses see note 1—summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for descriptions of our major accounting policies some of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions or if different assumptions had been used the following discussion of critical accounting estimates along with the discussion of contingencies in this report addresses all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions could be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change 

impairment of longlived assets and equity method investments 

longlived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future expected cash flows if the sum of the undiscounted expected future beforetax cash flows of an asset group is less than the carrying value including applicable liabilities the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for longlived assets the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined using one or more of the following methods the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants a market multiple for similar assets historical market transactions including similar assets adjusted using principal market participant assumptions when necessary or replacement cost adjusted for physical deterioration and economic obsolescence the expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments including future volumes commodity prices operating costs margins discount rates and capital project decisions considering all available information at the date of review 

investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are assessed for impairment when there are indicators of a loss in value such as a lack of sustained earnings capacity or a current fair value less than the investment’s carrying amount when it is determined that an indicated impairment is other than temporary a charge is recognized for the difference between the investment’s carrying value and its estimated fair value when determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary management considers factors such as the duration and extent of the decline the investee’s financial condition and nearterm prospects and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that allows for recovery when quoted market prices are not available the fair value is usually based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants and observed market earnings multiples of comparable companies if appropriate different assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period 

see note 9—impairments in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information about significant impairments recorded in 2021 2020 and 2019 

asset retirement obligations 

under various contracts permits and regulations we have legal obligations to remove tangible longlived assets and restore the land at the end of operations at certain operational sites estimating the timing and cost of future asset removals is difficult our recognized asset retirement obligations primarily involve asbestos abatement at our refineries decommissioning removal or dismantlement of certain assets at refineries that have or will be shut down and dismantlement or removal of assets at certain leased international marketing sites many of these removal obligations are many years or decades in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs asset removal technologies and costs regulatory and other compliance considerations expenditure timing and other inputs into valuation of the obligation including discount and inflation rates are also subject to change 

index to financial statements 

environmental costs 

in addition to asset retirement obligations discussed above we have certain obligations to complete environmentalrelated projects these projects are primarily related to cleanup at domestic refineries underground storage sites and nonoperated sites future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs timing and extent of such remedial actions that may be required and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties 

intangible assets and goodwill 

at december 31 2021 we had 715 million of intangible assets that we have determined to have indefinite useful lives and therefore do not amortize the judgmental determination that an intangible asset has an indefinite useful life is continuously evaluated if due to changes in facts and circumstances management determines these intangible assets have finite useful lives amortization will commence at that time on a prospective basis as long as these intangible assets are determined to have indefinite lives they will be subject to at least annual impairment tests that require management’s judgment of their estimated fair value 

at december 31 2021 we had 15 billion of goodwill primarily related to past business combinations goodwill is not amortized instead goodwill is subject to at least annual tests for impairment at a reporting unit level a reporting unit is an operating segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment and it is determined primarily based on the manner in which the business is managed 

we perform our annual goodwill impairment test using a qualitative assessment and a quantitative assessment if one is deemed necessary as part of our qualitative assessment we evaluate relevant events and circumstances that could affect the fair value of our reporting units including macroeconomic conditions overall industry and market considerations and regulatory changes as well as companyspecific market metrics performance and events the evaluation of companyspecific events and circumstances includes evaluating changes in our stock price and cost of capital actual and forecasted financial performance as well as the effect of significant asset dispositions if our qualitative assessment indicates it is likely the fair value of a reporting unit has declined below its carrying value including goodwill a quantitative assessment is performed 

when a quantitative assessment is performed management applies judgment in determining the estimated fair values of the reporting units because quoted market prices for our reporting units are not available management uses available information to make this fair value determination including estimated future cash flows cost of capital observed market earnings multiples of comparable companies our common stock price and associated total company market capitalization 

we completed our annual qualitative assessment of goodwill as of october 1 2021 and concluded that the fair values of our reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values including goodwill a decline in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units in the future could result in an impairment as such we continue to monitor for indicators of impairment until our next annual impairment assessment is performed 

see note 9—impairments and note 16—fair value measurements in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the goodwill impairment we recorded in the first quarter of 2020

tax assets and liabilities 

our operations are subject to various taxes including federal state and foreign income taxes property taxes and transactional taxes such as excise sales and use valueadded and payroll taxes we record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations the recording of tax liabilities requires significant judgment and estimates we recognize the financial statement effects of an income tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority a contingent liability related to a transactional tax claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and reasonably estimable actual incurred tax liabilities can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons including different interpretations of tax laws and regulations and different assessments of the amount of tax due 

in determining our income tax expense benefit we assess the likelihood our deferred tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income valuation allowances reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized judgment is required in estimating the amount of valuation allowance if any that should be recorded against our deferred tax assets based on our historical taxable income our expectations for the future and available taxplanning strategies we expect our net deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as reductions to future taxable income if our actual results of operations differ from such estimates or our estimates of future taxable income change the valuation allowance may need to be revised 

new tax laws and regulations as well as changes to existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being proposed or promulgated the implementation of future legislative and regulatory tax initiatives could result in increased income tax liabilities that cannot be predicted at this time 

projected benefit obligations 

calculation of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans impacts the obligations on the balance sheet and the amount of benefit expense in the statement of operations the actuarial calculation of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events including estimated retirement dates salary levels at retirement mortality rates lumpsum election rates rates of return on plan assets future interest rates future health care costtrend rates and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the calculation of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements due to the specialized nature of these calculations as financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies have different objectives and requirements the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects ultimately we will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions a one percentagepoint decrease in the discount rate assumption used for the plan obligation would increase annual benefit expense by an estimated 60 million while a one percentagepoint decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by an estimated 40 million in determining the discount rate we use yields on highquality fixed income investments with payments matched to the estimated distributions of benefits from our plans 

the expected weightedaverage longterm rate of return for worldwide pension plan assets was approximately 6 for both 2021 and 2020 while the actual weightedaverage rate of return was 10 in 2021 and 12 in 2020 for the past ten years our actual weightedaverage rate of return for worldwide pension plan assets was 10

the gaap performance measure most directly comparable to realized refining margin per barrel is the refining segment’s “income loss before income taxes per barrel” realized refining margin per barrel excludes items that are typically included in a manufacturer’s gross margin such as depreciation and operating expenses and other items used to determine income loss before income taxes such as general and administrative expenses it also includes our proportional share of joint venture refineries’ realized refining margins and excludes special items because realized refining margin per barrel is calculated in this manner and because realized refining margin per barrel may be defined differently by other companies in our industry it has limitations as an analytical tool following are reconciliations of income loss before income taxes to realized refining margins

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial instrument market risk 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are exposed to market risks produced by changes in the prices of crude oil refined petroleum product ngl natural gas renewable feedstock and electric power as well as fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we and certain of our subsidiaries may hold and use derivative contracts to manage these risks 

commodity price risk 

generally our policy is to remain exposed to the market prices of commodities consistent with this policy we use derivative contracts to convert our exposure from fixedprice sales or purchase contracts often specified in contracts with refined petroleum product customers back to floating market prices we also use futures forwards swaps and options in various markets to accomplish the following objectives 

• balance physical systems or meet our refinery requirements and market demand in addition to cash settlement prior to contract expiration certain exchangetraded futures may be settled by physical delivery of the underlying commodity 

• enable us to use the market knowledge gained from our physical commodity market activities to capture market opportunities such as moving physical commodities to more profitable locations storing commodities to capture seasonal or time premiums and blending commodities to capture quality upgrades derivatives may be utilized to optimize these activities 

• manage the risk to our cash flows from price exposures on specific crude oil refined petroleum product ngl renewable feedstock and natural gas transactions 

these objectives optimize the value of our supply chain and may reduce our exposure to fluctuations in market prices 

our use of derivative instruments is governed by an “authority limitations” document approved by our board of directors this document prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient market liquidity for comparable valuations and establishes value at risk var limits compliance with these limits is monitored daily by our global risk group 

we use a var model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative commodity instruments held or issued using monte carlo simulation a 95 confidence level and a oneday holding period the var for derivative commodity instruments issued or held at december 31 2021 and 2020 was immaterial to our cash flows and results of operations 

index to financial statements 

interest rate risk 

our use of fixed or variablerate debt directly exposes us to interest rate risk fixedrate debt such as our senior notes exposes us to changes in the fair value of our debt due to changes in market interest rates fixedrate debt also exposes us to the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at higher rates or that we may be obligated to pay rates higher than the current market variablerate debt such as our floatingrate notes or borrowings under our revolving credit facility exposes us to shortterm changes in market rates that impact our interest expense the following tables provide information about our debt instruments that are sensitive to changes in us interest rates these tables present principal cash flows and related weightedaverage interest rates by expected maturity dates weightedaverage variable rates are based on effective rates at each reporting date the carrying amount of our floatingrate debt approximates its fair value the fair value of the fixedrate financial instruments is estimated based on observable market prices 





foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to our international operations generally we do not enter into any derivative contracts to hedge our foreign currency risk 

our chief executive officer and chief financial officer monitor risks resulting from commodity prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form 10k each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition as well as the value of an investment in our common stock these risk factors do not identify all risks that we face our operations could also be affected by factors events or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we do not currently consider to present significant risks to our operations 

risks related to the covid19 pandemic 

the coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 pandemic has resulted in a significant decrease in demand for many of our products which has had and is expected to continue to have an adverse and potentially materially adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

the economic business and oil and gas industry impacts from the covid19 pandemic have continued to be far reaching within the past year crude oil prices have fallen dramatically to historic lows even briefly going negative due in part to severely reduced demand for crude oil gasoline jet fuel diesel fuel and other refined products resulting from governmentmandated travel restrictions and the curtailment of economic activity the reduced demand and resulting oversupply of products continue to negatively impact refinery utilization rates and operating margins in our refining business any prolonged period of economic stagnation as well as depressed oil prices may also adversely impact the financial results of our midstream chemicals and marketing and specialties businesses the company’s equity affiliates customers and other counterparties have also been negatively impacted by the covid19 pandemic and they may be unable to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely manner or at all which also could negatively affect our financial condition and cash flows 

the extent to which our business and operations and those of our equity affiliates customers and counterparties will continue to be negatively impacted depends on the duration and scope of any existing or new travel restrictions business and school closures and stay at home orders the extent of the negative impact also will depend on how quickly and to what extent economic conditions improve and normal business and operating conditions including demand for refined petroleum products resume 

additionally depending on future movements of market prices for products held in inventories we or certain of our equity affiliates could be required to make future inventory valuation adjustments which could affect our financial results any of the foregoing events or conditions or other consequences of the covid19 pandemic could significantly adversely affect our business and financial condition and the business and financial condition of our equity affiliates as well as our customers and other counterparties

risks related to our manufacturing and operations 

our financial results are affected by changing commodity prices and margins for refined petroleum petrochemical and plastics products 

our financial results are largely affected by the relationship or margin between the prices at which we sell refined petroleum petrochemical and plastics products and the prices for crude oil and other feedstocks used in manufacturing these products historically margins have been volatile and we expect they will continue to be volatile in the future 

the costs of feedstocks and the prices at which we can ultimately sell our products depend on numerous factors beyond our control including regional and global supply and demand which are subject to among other things production levels levels of refined petroleum product inventories productivity and growth of economies and governmental regulation we do not produce crude oil and must purchase all of the crude we process the prices for crude oil and refined petroleum products can fluctuate based on global regional and local market conditions as well as by type and class of products which can reduce margins and have a significant impact on our refining wholesale marketing and retail operations revenues operating income and cash flows also crude oil supply contracts generally have marketbased pricing provisions we normally purchase our refinery feedstocks weeks before manufacturing and selling the refined petroleum products we also purchase refined petroleum products produced by others for sale to our customers changes in prices that occur between the time we purchase feedstocks or products and when we sell the refined petroleum products could have a significant effect on our financial results 

the price of crude oil also influences prices for petrochemical and plastics products and the feedstocks used to manufacture the products our chemical segment uses feedstocks that are derivatively produced in the refining of crude oil and the processing of natural gas and those feedstock prices can fluctuate widely for a variety of reasons including changes in worldwide energy prices and the supply and availability of the feedstocks due to the highly competitive nature of most of the products sold by our chemicals segment market position cannot necessarily be protected by product differentiation or by passing on cost increases to customers as a result price increases in raw materials may not correlate with changes in the prices at which petrochemical and plastics products are sold thereby negatively affecting margins and the results of operations of our chemicals segment 

market conditions including commodity prices may impact the earnings financial condition and cash flows of our midstream business including phillips 66 partners and dcp midstream 

our midstream business is affected by the price of and demand for crude oil natural gas and ngl which have historically been volatile the prices for oil natural gas and ngl depend upon factors beyond our control including global and local demand production levels imports and exports seasonality and weather conditions economic and political conditions domestically and internationally and governmental regulations decreases in energy prices can decrease drilling activity production rates and investments by third parties in the development of new oil and natural gas reserves sustained periods of low prices can also cause producers to significantly curtail or limit their oil and gas drilling operations which could substantially delay the production and delivery of volumes of oil natural gas and ngl 

the volume of crude oil and refined petroleum products transported or stored in our pipelines and terminal facilities depends on the demand for and availability of attractively priced crude oil and products in the areas serviced by our assets a period of sustained low prices for crude oil or products could lead to a decline in drilling activity production and refining of crude oil which would lead to a decrease in the volumes of crude oil or petroleum products transported in our pipelines and terminal facilities negatively affecting our earnings and cash flows 

index to financial statements 

the natural gas gathered processed transported sold and stored by dcp midstream is delivered into pipelines for further delivery to endusers including fractionation facilities demand for these services may be substantially reduced due to lower rates of natural gas production as a result of declining commodity prices commodity prices including when ethane prices are low relative to natural gas prices can also negatively impact throughput volumes of ngl transported fractionated and stored by dcp midstream additionally dcp midstream’s revenues and cash flows can increase or decrease as the price of natural gas and ngl fluctuate because of certain contractual arrangements whereby natural gas is purchased for an agreed percentage of proceeds from the sale of the residue gas andor ngl resulting from its processing activities 

additionally the level of production from natural gas wells will naturally decline over time in order to maintain or increase throughput levels on its gathering and transportation pipeline systems and ngl pipelines and the asset utilization rates at its natural gas processing plants dcp midstream must continually obtain new supplies the level of successful drilling activity and prices of and demand for natural gas and crude oil as well as producers’ desire and ability to obtain necessary permits are some of the factors that may affect new supplies of natural gas and ngl if dcp midstream is not able to obtain new supplies of natural gas to replace the natural decline in volumes from existing wells or because of competition throughput on its pipelines and the utilization rates of its treating and processing facilities would decline this could have a material adverse effect on its business results of operations financial position and cash flows and its ability to make cash distributions to us 

our operations are subject to planned and unplanned downtime business interruptions and operational hazards any of which could adversely impact our ability to operate and could adversely impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our operating results are largely dependent on the continued operation of facilities and assets owned and operated by us and our equity affiliates interruptions may materially reduce productivity and thus the profitability of operations during and after downtime including for planned turnarounds and scheduled maintenance activities in the past we and certain of our equity affiliates also have temporarily shut down facilities due to the threat of severe weather such as hurricanes although we take precautions to ensure and enhance the safety of our operations and minimize the risk of disruptions our operations are also subject to hazards inherent in chemicals refining and midstream businesses such as explosions fires refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents power outages labor disputes or other natural or manmade disasters such as acts of terrorism including cyber intrusion the inability to operate facilities or assets due to any of these events could significantly impair our ability to manufacture process store or transport products 

any casualty occurrence involving our assets or operations could result in serious personal injury or loss of human life significant damage to property and equipment environmental pollution impairment of operations and substantial losses to us for assets located near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers industrial sites and other public gathering areas the level of damage resulting from these risks could be greater damages resulting from an incident involving any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially substantial claims or in our being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities should any of these risks materialize at any of our equity affiliates it could have a material adverse effect on the business and financial condition of the equity affiliate and negatively impact their ability to make future distributions to us 

we are subject to interruptions of supply and offtake as well as increased costs as a result of our reliance on thirdparty transportation of crude oil ngl and refined petroleum products 

we often utilize the services of third parties to transport crude oil ngl and refined petroleum products to and from our facilities in addition to our own operational risks we could experience interruptions of supply or increases in costs to deliver refined petroleum products to market if the ability of the pipelines or vessels to transport crude oil or refined petroleum products is disrupted because of weather events accidents governmental regulations or thirdparty actions a prolonged disruption of the ability of a pipeline or vessel to transport crude oil ngl or refined petroleum products to or from one or more of our refineries or other facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

index to financial statements 

competition risks 

refining and marketing competitors that produce their own feedstocks have more extensive retail outlets or have greater financial resources may have a competitive advantage 

the refining and marketing industry is highly competitive with respect to both feedstock supply and refined petroleum product markets we compete with many companies for available supplies of crude oil and other feedstocks and for outlets for our refined petroleum products we do not produce any of our crude oil feedstocks some of our competitors however obtain a portion of their feedstocks from their own production and some have more extensive retail outlets than we have competitors that have their own production or extensive retail outlets and greater brandname recognition are at times able to offset losses from refining operations with profits from producing or retailing operations and may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages 

some of our competitors also have materially greater financial and other resources than we have such competitors have a greater ability to bear the economic risks inherent in all aspects of our business in addition we compete with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel requirements of our industrial commercial and individual customers 

market demand for transportation and midstream services and the risk of overbuild could negatively impact the results of operations of our midstream business 

we and our midstream equity affiliates compete with other pipelines and terminals that provide similar services in the same markets as our assets we compete on the basis of many factors including but not limited to rates service levels and offerings geographic location connectivity and reliability our competitors could construct new assets or redeploy existing assets in a manner that would result in more intense competition additionally we could be required to increase our costs or reduce the fees we charge in order to retain our customers 

we and our equity affiliates have made and continue to make significant investments in new infrastructure projects to meet market demand similar investments have been made and additional investments may be made in the future by us our competitors or by new entrants to the markets we serve the success of these investments largely depends on the realization of anticipated market demand and these projects typically require significant development periods during which time demand for such infrastructure may change or additional investments by competitors may be made any of these or other competitive forces could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial position or cash flows as well as our ability to pay cash distributions 

strategic performance and future growth risks 

large capital projects can take many years to complete and market conditions could deteriorate significantly between the project approval date and the project startup date negatively impacting expected project returns 

our basis for approving a largescale capital project is the expectation that it will deliver an acceptable rate of return on the capital invested we base these forecasted project economics on our best estimate of future market conditions including the regulatory and operating environment most largescale projects take several years to complete during this multiyear period market conditions can change from those we forecast and these changes could be significant accordingly we may not be able to realize our expected returns from a large investment in a capital project and this could negatively impact our results of operations cash flows and our return on capital employed 

index to financial statements 

plans we may have to expand existing assets or construct new assets particularly in our midstream segment are subject to risks associated with societal and political pressures and other forms of opposition to the future development transportation and use of carbonbased fuels such risks could adversely impact our ability to realize certain growth strategies 

certain of our planned expenditures are based upon the assumption that societal sentiment will continue to enable and existing regulations will remain intact to allow for the future development transportation and use of carbonbased fuels a portion of our growth strategy is dependent on our ability to expand existing assets and to construct additional assets policy decisions relating to the production refining transportation and marketing of carbonbased fuels are subject to political pressures and the influence and protests of environmental and other special interest groups for example our midstream segment’s growth plans include the construction or expansion of pipelines which can involve numerous regulatory environmental political and legal uncertainties many of which are beyond our control our growth projects may not be completed on schedule or at the budgeted cost in addition our revenues may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs could negatively impact our results of operations cash flows and our return on capital employed 

political and economic developments could affect our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows 

actions of federal state local and international governments through legislation or regulation executive order permit or other review of infrastructure or facility development and commercial restrictions could delay projects increase costs limit development or otherwise reduce our profitability both in the united states and abroad any such actions may affect many aspects of our operations including 

• requiring permits or other approvals that may impose unforeseen or unduly burdensome conditions or potentially cause delays in our operations 

• further limiting or prohibiting construction or other activities in environmentally sensitive or other areas 

• requiring increased capital costs to construct maintain or upgrade equipment facilities or infrastructure 

• restricting the locations where we may construct facilities or requiring the relocation of facilities 

in addition the us government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries and from doing business with entities affiliated with foreign governments which can include state oil companies and us subsidiaries of those companies the office of foreign assets control ofac of the us department of the treasury administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on us foreign policy and national security matters the effect of any such ofac sanctions could disrupt transactions with or operations involving entities affiliated with sanctioned countries and could limit our ability to obtain optimum crude slates and other refinery feedstocks and effectively distribute refined petroleum products 

other political and economic risks include global pandemics financial market turmoil economic volatility and global economic slowdown currency exchange rate fluctuations and inflationary pressures import or export restrictions and changes in trade regulations acts of terrorism war civil unrest and other political risks difficulties in developing staffing and managing operations and potentially adverse tax developments if any of these events occur our businesses and results of operations may be adversely affected

regulatory and environmental climate and weather risks 

climate change and severe weather may adversely affect our and our joint ventures’ facilities and ongoing operations 

the potential physical effects of climate change and severe weather on our operations are highly uncertain and depend upon the unique geographic and environmental factors present we have systems in place to manage potential acute physical risks including those that may be caused by climate change but if any such events were to occur they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations examples of potential physical risks include floods hurricaneforce winds wildfires freezing temperatures and snowstorms as well as rising sea levels at our coastal facilities we have incurred and will continue to incur costs to protect our assets from physical risks and to employ processes to the extent available to mitigate such risks 

many of our facilities are located near coastal areas as are many of cpchem’s facilities as a result extreme weather and rising sea levels may disrupt the ability to operate these facilities or transport crude oil refined petroleum or petrochemical and plastics products extended periods of such disruption could have an adverse effect on our results of operations we could also incur substantial costs to prevent or repair damage to these facilities finally depending on the severity and duration of any extreme weather events or climate conditions our operations may need to be modified and material costs incurred which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

there are certain environmental hazards and risks inherent in our operations that could adversely affect those operations and our financial results 

the operation of refineries power plants fractionators pipelines terminals and vessels is inherently subject to the risks of spills discharges or other inadvertent releases of petroleum or hazardous substances if any of these events had previously occurred or occurs in the future in connection with any of our refineries pipelines or refined petroleum products terminals or in connection with any facilities that receive our wastes or byproducts for treatment or disposal other than events for which we are indemnified we could be liable for all costs and penalties associated with their remediation under federal state local and international environmental laws or common law and could be liable for property damage to third parties caused by contamination from releases and spills 

we expect to continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of our compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations 

our business is subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment these laws and regulations continue to increase in both number and complexity and affect our operations with respect to among other things 

• the discharge of pollutants into the environment 

• emissions into the atmosphere such as nitrogen oxides sulfur dioxide and mercury emissions and greenhouse gas ghg emissions as they are or may become regulated 

• the quantity of renewable fuels that must be blended into motor fuels 

• the handling use storage transportation disposal and cleanup of hazardous materials and hazardous and nonhazardous wastes 

• the dismantlement and abandonment of our facilities and restoration of our properties at the end of their useful lives 

to the extent these expenditures as with all costs are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in future periods could be materially adversely affected 

index to financial statements 

the adoption of climate change legislation or regulation could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the refined petroleum products we produce 

currently multiple legislative and regulatory measures to address ghg and other emissions are in various phases of consideration promulgation or implementation these include actions to develop international federal regional or statewide programs which could require reductions in our ghg or other emissions establish a carbon tax and decrease the demand for our refined products requiring reductions in these emissions could result in increased costs to i operate and maintain our facilities ii install new emission controls at our facilities and iii administer and manage any emissions programs including acquiring emission credits or allotments 

for example in 2017 the california state legislature adopted assembly bill 398 which provides direction and parameters on utilizing cap and trade after 2020 to meet the 40 reduction target from 1990 levels by 2030 specified in senate bill 32 compliance with the cap and trade program is demonstrated through a marketbased credit system additionally the california air resources board is now exploring the potential for additional ghg reductions by 2045 via a yet undefined carbon neutrality standard and california’s governor has issued an executive order calling for a ban on the instate sales of new cars containing internal combustion engines beginning in 2035 other states are proposing or have already promulgated low carbon fuel standards or similar initiatives to reduce emissions from the transportation sector if we are unable to pass the costs of compliance on to our customers sufficient credits are unavailable for purchase we have to pay a significantly higher price for credits or if we are otherwise unable to meet our compliance obligation our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

regional and state climate change and air emissions goals and regulatory programs are complex subject to change and considerable uncertainty due to a number of factors including technological feasibility legal challenges and potential changes in federal policy increasing concerns about climate change and carbon intensity have also resulted in societal concerns and a number of international and national measures to limit ghg emissions additional stricter measures and investor pressure can be expected in the future and any of these changes may have a material adverse impact on our business or financial condition 

international climate changerelated efforts such as the 2015 united nations conference on climate change which led to the creation of the paris agreement may impact the regulatory framework of states whose policies directly influence our present and future operations although the united states had previously withdrawn from the paris agreement it has since taken the steps necessary to rejoin which was effective in february 2021 the us climate change strategy and the impact to our industry and operations due to ghg regulation is unknown at this time 

increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in us production of crude oil and natural gas which could adversely impact our results of operations 

an increasing percentage of crude oil supplied to our refineries and the crude oil and gas production of our midstream segment’s customers is being produced from unconventional oil shale reservoirs these reservoirs require hydraulic fracturing completion processes to release the hydrocarbons from the rock so they can flow through casing to the surface hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water sand and chemicals under pressure into a formation to stimulate hydrocarbon production the epa as well as several state agencies have commenced studies andor convened hearings regarding the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities at the same time certain environmental groups have suggested that additional laws may be needed to more closely and uniformly regulate the hydraulic fracturing process and legislation has been proposed to provide for such regulation in addition some communities have adopted measures to ban hydraulic fracturing in their communities we cannot predict whether any such legislation will ever be enacted and if so what its provisions would be 

any additional levels of regulation and permits required with the adoption of new laws and regulations at the federal or state level could result in our having to rely on higher priced crude oil for our refineries the resulting increased operating costs process prohibitions and delays could also reduce natural gas and ngl supplies negatively affecting midstream and chemicals operations 

index to financial statements 

compliance with the epa’s renewable fuel standard rfs could adversely affect our financial results 

the epa has implemented the rfs pursuant to the energy policy act of 2005 and the energy independence and security act of 2007 the rfs program sets annual quotas for the quantity of renewable fuels such as ethanol that must be blended into motor fuels consumed in the united states to provide certain flexibility in compliance options available to the industry a renewable identification number rin is assigned to each gallon of renewable fuel produced in or imported into the united states as a producer of petroleumbased motor fuels we are obligated to blend renewable fuels into the products we produce at a rate that is at least commensurate to the epa’s quota and to the extent we do not we must purchase rins in the open market to satisfy our obligation under the rfs program 

we are exposed to the volatility in the market price of rins we cannot predict the future prices of rins rins prices are dependent upon a variety of factors including epa regulations the availability of rins for purchase and levels of transportation fuels produced which can vary significantly from quarter to quarter if sufficient rins are unavailable for purchase if we have to pay a significantly higher price for rins or if we are otherwise unable to meet the epa’s rfs mandates including because the epa mandates a blending quantity of renewable fuel that exceeds the amount that is commercially feasible to blend into motor fuel a situation commonly referred to as “the blend wall” our operations could be materially adversely impacted up to and including a reduction in produced motor fuel 

societal technological political and scientific developments around emissions and fuel efficiency may decrease demand for transportation fuels 

developments aimed at reducing ghg emissions may decrease the demand or increase the cost for our transportation fuels attitudes toward these products and their relationship to the environment may significantly affect our effectiveness in marketing our products government efforts to steer the public toward nonpetroleumbased fuel dependent modes of transportation may foster a negative perception toward transportation fuels or increase costs of our products thus affecting the public’s attitude toward our major product advanced technology and increased use of vehicles that do not use petroleumbased transportation fuels or that are powered by hybrid engines would reduce demand for motor fuel we may also incur increased production costs which we may not be able to pass along to our customers 

additionally renewable fuels alternative energy mandates and energy conservation efforts could reduce demand for refined petroleum products tax incentives and other subsidies can make renewable fuels and alternative energy more competitive with refined petroleum products than they otherwise might be which may reduce refined petroleum product margins and hinder the ability of refined petroleum products to compete with renewable fuels 

these developments could potentially have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

cybersecurity and data privacy risks 

security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability which would cause our business and reputation to suffer 

our information technology and infrastructure or information technology and infrastructure of our thirdparty service providers eg cloudbased service providers may be vulnerable to attacks by malicious actors or breached due to human error malfeasance or other disruptions any such breaches could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in one or more of the following outcomes i a loss of intellectual property proprietary information or employee customer or vendor data ii public disclosure of sensitive information iii increased costs to prevent respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events such as deploying additional personnel and protection technologies training employees and engaging thirdparty experts and consultants iv systems interruption v disruption of our business operations vi remediation costs for repairs of system damage vii reputational damage that adversely affects customer or investor confidence and viii damage to our competitiveness stock price and longterm stockholder value although we have experienced occasional actual or attempted breaches of our cybersecurity we do not believe that any of these breaches has had a material effect on our business operations or financial condition 

index to financial statements 

a breach may also result in legal claims or proceedings against us by our shareholders employees customers vendors and governmental authorities us and nonus our infrastructure protection technologies and disaster recovery plans may not be able to prevent a technology systems breach or systems failure which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations furthermore the continuing and evolving threat of cyberattacks has resulted in increased regulatory focus on prevention to the extent we face increased regulatory requirements we may be required to expend significant additional resources to meet such requirements 

increasing regulatory focus on privacy and cybersecurity issues and expanding laws could expose us to increased liability subject us to lawsuits investigations and other liabilities and restrictions on our operations that could significantly and adversely affect our business 

along with our own data and information collected in the normal course of our business we and our partners collect and retain certain data that is subject to specific laws and regulations the transfer and use of this data both domestically and across international borders is becoming increasingly complex this data is subject to governmental regulation at the federal state international national provincial and local levels in many areas of our business including data privacy and security laws such as the european union eu general data protection regulation gdpr and the california consumer privacy act ccpa 

the gdpr applies to activities related to personal data that are conducted from an establishment in the eu as interpretation and enforcement of the gdpr evolves it creates a range of new compliance obligations which could cause us to incur additional costs failure to comply could result in significant penalties that may materially adversely affect our business reputation results of operations and cash flows 

the ccpa which came into effect on january 1 2020 gives california residents specific rights in relation to their personal information requires that companies take certain actions including notifications for security incidents and may apply to activities regarding personal information that is collected by us directly or indirectly from california residents as interpretation and enforcement of the ccpa evolves it creates a range of new compliance obligations with the possibility for significant financial penalties for noncompliance that may materially adversely affect our business reputation results of operations and cash flows 

the gdpr and ccpa as well as other data privacy laws that may become applicable to our business pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and potentially elevate our costs any failure by us to comply with these laws and regulations including as a result of a security or privacy breach could result in significant penalties and liabilities for us additionally if we acquire a company that has violated or is not in compliance with applicable data protection laws we may incur significant liabilities and penalties as a result 

risks related to our joint ventures and our mlp 

our investments in joint ventures decrease our ability to manage risk 

we conduct some of our operations including parts of our midstream refining and ms segments and our entire chemicals segment through joint ventures in which we share control with our joint venture partners our joint venture partners may have economic business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours or those of the joint venture or our joint venture participants may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone failure by us or an entity in which we have a joint venture interest to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisitions or joint ventures could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our joint ventures and in turn our business and operations 

one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of a publicly traded mlp phillips 66 partners which may involve a greater exposure to legal liability than our historic business operations 

one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of phillips 66 partners a publicly traded mlp our control of the general partner of phillips 66 partners may increase the possibility that we could be subject to claims of breach of fiduciary duties including claims of conflicts of interest related to phillips 66 partners any liability resulting from such claims could have a material adverse effect on our future business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

our ability to obtain credit and capital depends in large measure on the state of the credit and capital markets which is beyond our control our ability to access credit and capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like or need access to those markets which could constrain our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions in addition the cost and availability of debt and equity financing may be adversely impacted by unstable or illiquid market conditions protracted uncertainty and illiquidity in these markets also could have an adverse impact on our lenders commodity transaction counterparties or our customers preventing them from meeting their obligations to us 

from time to time our cash needs may exceed our cash from our consolidated operations and joint venture distributions and our business could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to obtain necessary funds from financing activities from time to time we may need to supplement cash generated from operations with proceeds from financing activities uncertainty and illiquidity in financial markets may materially impact the ability of the participating financial institutions to fund their commitments to us under our liquidity facilities that are supported by a broad syndicate of financial institutions accordingly we may not be able to obtain the full amount of the funds available under our liquidity facilities to satisfy our cash requirements and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position 

investor sentiment towards climate change fossil fuels and sustainability could adversely affect our business and the market price for our common stock 

there have been efforts in recent years aimed at the investment community including investment advisors sovereign wealth funds public pension funds universities and other groups to promote the divestment of shares of energy companies as well as to pressure lenders and other financial services companies to limit or curtail activities with energy companies if these efforts are successful our stock price and our ability to access capital markets may be negatively impacted 

members of the investment community are also increasing their focus on sustainability practices including practices related to ghg and climate change in the energy industry as a result we may face increasing pressure regarding our sustainability disclosures and practices additionally members of the investment community may screen companies such as ours for sustainability performance before investing in our stock 

if we are unable to meet the sustainability standards set by these investors we may lose investors our stock price may be negatively impacted and our reputation may be negatively affected 

we do not insure against all potential losses and therefore our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by unexpected liabilities and increased costs 

we maintain insurance coverage in amounts we believe to be prudent against many but not all potential liabilities arising from operating hazards uninsured liabilities arising from operating hazards including but not limited to explosions fires refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents involving our assets or operations could reduce the funds available to us for capital and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

deterioration in our credit profile could increase our costs of borrowing money limit our access to the capital markets and commercial credit and could trigger coventurer rights under joint venture arrangements 

our or phillips 66 partners’ credit ratings could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment the circumstances warrant if a rating agency were to downgrade our rating below investment grade our or phillips 66 partners’ borrowing costs would increase and our funding sources could decrease in addition a failure by us to maintain an investment grade rating could affect our business relationships with suppliers and operating partners for example our agreement with chevron corporation chevron regarding cpchem permits chevron to buy our 50 interest in cpchem for fair market value if we experience a change in control or if both standard  poor’s financial services llc and moody’s investors service inc lower our credit ratings below investment grade and the credit rating from either rating agency remains below investment grade for 365 days thereafter with fair market value determined by agreement or by nationally recognized investment banks as a result of these factors a downgrade of credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our future operations and financial position 

the level of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the expected return on plan assets for our pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans are evaluated by us based on a variety of independent sources of market information and in consultation with outside actuaries if we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected longterm rate of return or health care cost trend rate our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses and funding requirements could increase in addition several factors could cause actual results to differ significantly from the actuarial assumptions that we use funding obligations are determined based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date as required under relevant regulations future pension funding requirements and the timing of funding payments could be affected by legislation enacted by governmental authorities 

we may incur losses as a result of our forward contracts and derivative transactions 

we currently use commodity derivative instruments and we expect to use them in the future if the instruments we utilize to hedge our exposure to various types of risk are not effective we may incur losses derivative transactions involve the risk that counterparties may be unable to satisfy their obligations to us the risk of counterparty default is heightened in a poor economic environment 

continuing risks related to spinoff from conocophillips 

we are subject to continuing contingent liabilities of conocophillips following the separation further conocophillips has indemnified us for certain matters but may not be able to satisfy its obligations to us in the future 

in connection with our separation from conocophillips we entered into a tax sharing agreement that allocates the responsibility for prior period taxes of the conocophillips consolidated tax reporting group between us and conocophillips conocophillips may be unable to pay any prior period taxes for which it is responsible and we could be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes other provisions of federal law establish similar liability for other matters including laws governing taxqualified pension plans as well as other contingent liabilities additionally the tax sharing agreement provides that if the separation and certain related transactions fail to qualify as taxfree transactions we may be responsible for any resulting tax liabilities our indemnification obligations under the tax sharing agreement are not subject to any cap and could be significant we also entered into an indemnification and release agreement and certain other agreements in connection with the separation pursuant to which conocophillips agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities and we agreed to indemnify conocophillips for certain liabilities indemnities that we may be required to provide are not subject to any cap and may be significant third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that conocophillips has agreed to retain further the indemnity from conocophillips may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities and conocophillips may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations each of these risks could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition

executive overview and business environment 

phillips 66 is an energy manufacturing and logistics company with midstream chemicals refining and marketing and specialties businesses at december 31 2020 we had total assets of 547 billion 

executive overview 

the covid19 pandemic continues to disrupt economic activities globally actions taken by governments to prevent the spread of the disease including travel and business restrictions have resulted in substantial decreases in the demand for many refined petroleum products particularly gasoline and jet fuel the lack of demand for petroleum products has resulted in low crude oil prices and refining margins accordingly crude oil producers have shut in high cost production and refiners have reduced crude oil processing rates 

during 2020 we took the following significant steps to enhance our liquidity in this challenged margin environment 

• issued 375 billion of senior unsecured notes and borrowed a net 500 million under a term loan facility 

• temporarily suspended our share repurchase program 

• reduced consolidated capital spending in 2020 by more than 700 million compared with our original budget 

• exceeded our 500 million cost reduction target in 2020 

in 2020 we reported a loss of 40 billion and generated 21 billion in cash from operating activities we used available cash and the debt financing noted above to fund capital expenditures and investments of 29 billion pay dividends of 16 billion and repurchase 04 billion of our common stock we ended 2020 with 25 billion of cash and cash equivalents and approximately 53 billion of total committed capacity available under our credit facilities 

our results in 2020 reflect the adverse effects of the covid19 pandemic including asset and investment impairments these adverse effects may continue to be significant in the near term the depth and duration of the economic consequences of the covid19 pandemic remain unknown we continuously monitor our asset and investment portfolio for impairments as well as optimization opportunities in this challenging business environment as such additional impairments may be required in the future 

index to financial statements 

we continue to focus on the following strategic priorities 

• operating excellence our commitment to operating excellence guides everything we do we are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations and the communities in which we operate continuous improvement in safety environmental stewardship reliability and cost efficiency is a fundamental requirement for our company and employees we employ rigorous training and audit programs to drive ongoing improvement in both personal and process safety as we strive for zero incidents in 2020 we achieved a 011 total recordable incident rate—the lowest since our inception since we cannot control commodity prices controlling operating expenses and overhead costs within the context of our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship is a high priority senior management actively monitors these costs we are committed to protecting the environment and strive to reduce our environmental footprint throughout our operations optimizing utilization rates at our refineries through reliable and safe operations enables us to capture the value available in the market in terms of prices and margins during 2020 our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 76 mainly driven by the decrease in market demand for refined petroleum products due to negative impacts from the covid19 pandemic 

• growth a disciplined capital allocation process ensures we invest in projects that are expected to generate competitive returns our strategy primarily focuses on investing in growth opportunities in the midstream and chemicals segments in response to the challenging market conditions caused by the covid19 pandemic we reduced our 2021 capital budget to 17 billion we are prioritizing sustaining capital spending and completion of inprogress growth projects as well as advancing our investments in renewable fuels in the third quarter of 2020 we announced rodeo renewed a project to reconfigure our san francisco refinery in rodeo california to produce renewable fuels in 2021 we have budgeted 615 million for midstream capital expenditures and investments including 305 million for phillips 66 partners capital will be used to complete nearterm committed and optimization projects and to maintain our integrated logistics infrastructure network in chemicals our share of expected selffunded capital spending by cpchem is 410 million cpchem plans to use its growth capital to fund expansion of its normal alpha olefins production optimization and debottleneck opportunities in the olefins and polyolefins chains as well as continuing development of petrochemical projects on the us gulf coast and in qatar we recently formed an emerging energy organization this group is charged with establishing a lowercarbon business platform that delivers attractive returns it will focus on opportunities within our portfolio such as rodeo renewed as well as commercializing emerging energy technologies for a sustainable future 

• returns we plan to enhance refining returns by increasing throughput of advantaged feedstocks improving yields portfolio optimization and an ongoing commitment to operating excellence for 2021 capital in refining will be directed toward highreturn projects to enhance the yield of highervalue products and other highreturn quickpayout projects as well as investments to competitively position the company for a lowercarbon future ms will continue to develop and enhance our retail network and brands in the united states and europe 

• distributions we believe shareholder value is enhanced through among other things consistent growth of regular dividends complemented by share repurchases regular dividends demonstrate the confidence our board of directors and management have in our capital structure and operations’ capability to generate free cash flow throughout the business cycle in 2020 despite the challenging business environment we maintained stable quarterly dividend distributions to shareholders and repurchased 443 million of common stock before suspending our share repurchase program in march 2020 to preserve liquidity 

• highperforming organization we strive to attract develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business strategy and who support our values and culture throughout the company we focus on getting results in the right way embrace our values as a common bond and believe success is both what we do and how we do it we encourage collaboration throughout our company while valuing differences respecting diversity and creating a great place to work we foster an environment of learning and development through structured programs focused on enhancing functional and technical skills where employees are engaged in our business and committed to their own as well as the company’s success

business environment 

the midstream segment includes our transportation and ngl businesses our transportation business contains feebased operations that are not directly exposed to commodity price risk our ngl business contains both feebased operations and operations that are directly impacted by ngl prices the midstream segment also includes our 50 equity investment in dcp midstream ngl prices were significantly lower in 2020 compared with 2019 due to negative economic impacts caused by the covid19 pandemic 

the chemicals segment consists of our 50 equity investment in cpchem the chemicals and plastics industry is mainly a commoditybased industry where the margins for key products are based on supply and demand as well as cost factors compared with 2019 the benchmark highdensity polyethylene chain margin was lower in the first three quarters of 2020 before rebounding strongly in the fourth quarter of 2020 the lower margin in the first three quarters of 2020 was mainly due to lower polyethylene sales prices the significant margin increase in the fourth quarter of 2020 was primarily driven by tight supply caused by hurricane impacts in the gulf coast region and a strong global market demand 

our refining segment results are driven by several factors including refining margins refinery throughput feedstock costs product yields turnaround activity and other operating costs the price of us benchmark crude oil west texas intermediate wti at cushing oklahoma decreased to an average of 3931 per barrel during 2020 compared with an average of 5702 per barrel in 2019 due to a significant decline in global demand driven by the adverse impacts of the covid19 pandemic market crack spreads are used as indicators of refining margins and measure the difference between market prices for refined petroleum products and crude oil during 2020 the worldwide market crack spreads were significantly lower compared with 2019 mainly driven by a sharp decline in demand for refined petroleum products resulting from the covid19 global pandemic 

results for our ms segment depend largely on marketing fuel and lubricant margins and sales volumes of our refined petroleum and other specialty products while ms margins are primarily driven by market factors largely determined by the relationship between supply and demand marketing fuel margins in particular are influenced by the trend in spot prices for refined petroleum products generally speaking a downward trend of spot prices has a favorable impact on marketing fuel margins while an upward trend of spot prices has an unfavorable impact on marketing fuel margins the global disruption caused by the covid19 pandemic significantly reduced demand for our refined petroleum and specialty products in 2020 compared with 2019

a summary of income loss before income taxes by business segment with a reconciliation to net income loss attributable to phillips 66 follows 

  



2020 vs 2019 

our results decreased 7051 million in 2020 mainly reflecting

• a longlived asset impairment associated with our plan to reconfigure the san francisco refinery into a renewable fuels facility which impacted our refining and midstream segments 

• higher impairments of equity investments in our midstream segment 

these decreases were partially offset by an income tax benefit recognized in 2020 compared with income tax expense recognized in 2019 

2019 vs 2018 

our earnings decreased 2519 million in 2019 mainly reflecting 

• lower realized refining and marketing margins 

• impairments associated with our equity investment in dcp midstream 

• decreased equity in earnings of affiliates in our refining and chemicals segments 

these decreases were partially offset by 

• lower income tax expense 

• improved results from our ngl and transportation businesses

statement of operations analysis 

2020 vs 2019 

sales and other operating revenues and purchased crude oil and products both decreased 40 in 2020 the decreases were mainly due to lower prices and volumes for refined petroleum products and crude oil reflecting the impact of the covid19 pandemic 

equity in earnings of affiliates decreased 44 in 2020 the decrease was primarily due to lower realized refining margins and decreased refinery production at wrb and lower margins partially offset by higher sales volumes at cpchem see chemicals segment analysis in the “segment results” section for additional information on cpchem 

net gain on dispositions increased 88 million in 2020 the increase was mainly due to a gain of 84 million associated with a coventurer’s prioryear acquisition of a 35 interest in phillips 66 partners’ consolidated holding company that owns an interest in gray oak pipeline llc see note 27—phillips 66 partners lp in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

operating expenses decreased 10 in 2020 primarily driven by our companywide cost reduction initiatives in response to the covid19 pandemic lower utility costs and decreased refinery turnaround activities 

impairments increased 3391 million in 2020 see note 9—impairments and note 16—fair value measurements in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information associated with impairments 

we had an income tax benefit of 1250 million in 2020 compared with income tax expense of 801 million in 2019 primarily due to a net loss in 2020 versus net income in 2019 see note 21—income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our income taxes 

2019 vs 2018 

sales and other operating revenues and purchased crude oil and products decreased 4 and 2 respectively in 2019 the decreases were mainly driven by lower prices for refined petroleum products crude oil and ngl 

equity in earnings of affiliates decreased 21 in 2019 the decrease was mainly due to lower margins at wrb and cpchem partially offset by improved results from our transportation and ngl joint venture assets lower equity earnings in 2019 also reflected higher goodwill and other asset impairments at dcp midstream see the “segment results” section for additional information 

other income increased 58 million in 2019 the increase was mainly driven by trading activities not directly related to our physical business see note 15—derivatives and financial instruments in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information associated with our commodity derivatives 

impairments increased 853 million in 2019 the increase was driven by an 853 million beforetax impairment associated with our investment in dcp midstream recognized in the third quarter of 2019 see note 9—impairments and note 16—fair value measurements in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information associated with this impairment 

income tax expense benefit decreased 49 in 2019 the decrease in income tax expense was primarily attributable to lower income before income taxes see note 21—income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our income taxes

midstream’s results decreased 693 million in 2020 compared with 2019 

results from our transportation business decreased 438 million in 2020 compared with 2019 the decrease was primarily attributable to beforetax impairments of 300 million decreased equity earnings lower pipeline and terminal throughput volumes and higher operating costs partially offset by an 84 million beforetax gain recognized in the second quarter of 2020 associated with the gray oak pipeline joint venture 

the 300 million beforetax impairments consisted of a 120 million impairment of the pipeline and terminal assets associated with the planned reconfiguration of our san francisco refinery into a renewable fuels facility a 96 million impairment of phillips 66 partners’ equity investments in two crude oil logistics joint ventures and an 84 million impairment of our equity investment in the canceled red oak pipeline project

results from our ngl and other business decreased 81 million in 2020 compared with 2019 the decrease was mainly due to lower results from our trading activities and decreased margins partially offset by higher export cargos and increased fractionation volumes from the startup of frac 2 and frac 3 in late 2020 as well as the startup of a new isomerization unit at our lake charles refinery in the second half of 2019 

results from our investment in dcp midstream decreased 174 million in 2020 compared with 2019 the decrease was primarily due to higher impairment charges partially offset by the recognition of a larger benefit to our equity earnings from the amortization of the basis difference associated with the impairments and dcp midstream’s cost reduction initiatives in response to the challenging business environment see note 6—investments loans and longterm receivables and note 9—impairments in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the impairments and the associated basis difference amortization related to our investment in dcp midstream

beforetax income from our transportation business increased 176 million in 2019 compared with 2018 the increase was mainly driven by higher volumes and pipeline tariffs from our portfolio of consolidated and joint venture assets 

beforetax income from our ngl and other business increased 217 million in 2019 compared with 2018 the increase was mainly due to improved margins and volumes primarily at the sweeny hub and higher equity earnings from certain pipeline affiliates driven by higher volumes 

beforetax income from our investment in dcp midstream decreased 890 million in 2019 compared with 2018 the decrease was primarily due to an 853 million beforetax impairment associated with our investment in dcp midstream and lower equity earnings driven by higher goodwill and other asset impairments at dcp partners in 2019 see note 6—investments loans and longterm receivables note 9—impairments and note 16—fair value measurements in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our investment in dcp midstream

2020 vs 2019 

beforetax income from the chemicals segment decreased 244 million in 2020 compared with 2019 the decrease was mainly due to lower margins and decreased earnings from cpchem’s equity affiliates partially offset by higher sales volumes and a favorable impact from lowerofcostormarket adjustments of inventories valued on the lastinfirstout lifo basis attributable to petrochemical product price recovery in 2020

2020 vs 2019 

results from the refining segment decreased 8141 million in 2020 compared with 2019 the decreased results in 2020 were due to 

• lower realized refining margins and decreased refinery production a sharp decline in demand for refined petroleum products resulting from global economic disruption caused by the covid19 pandemic led to lower market crack spreads and reduced refinery production in 2020 in addition hurricane impacts contributed to the lower refinery production in the gulf coast region in 2020 

• a beforetax longlived asset impairment of 910 million in the third quarter of 2020 associated with our plan to reconfigure the san francisco refinery into a renewable fuels facility 

• a beforetax goodwill impairment of 1845 million in the first quarter of 2020

capital resources and liquidity 

financial indicators 



to meet our short and longterm liquidity requirements we use a variety of funding sources but rely primarily on cash generated from operating activities and debt financing during 2020 we generated 21 billion in cash from operations and had net borrowings of 41 billion we used available cash primarily for capital expenditures and investments of 29 billion and dividend payments on our common stock of 16 billion during the first quarter of 2020 we repurchased 443 million of common stock before suspending our share repurchase program in march 2020 during 2020 cash and cash equivalents increased 900 million to 25 billion 

significant sources of capital 

operating activities 

during 2020 cash generated by operating activities was 2111 million a 56 decrease compared with 2019 the decrease was primarily due to lower realized refining margins driven by the global economic disruption caused by the covid19 pandemic partially offset by lower cash income taxes paid 

during 2019 cash generated by operating activities was 4808 million a 37 decrease compared with 2018 the decrease was mainly driven by lower realized refining margins and decreased distributions from our equity affiliates along with unfavorable working capital impacts partially offset by improved results from our transportation and ngl and other businesses 

our short and longterm operating cash flows are highly dependent upon refining and marketing margins ngl prices and chemicals margins prices and margins in our industry are typically volatile and are driven by market conditions over which we have little or no control absent other mitigating factors as these prices and margins fluctuate we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows the recent decline in demand for refined petroleum products has led to a decrease in refining margins if the global economic disruption associated with the covid19 pandemic sustains we expect refining margins to remain challenged in the near term all of which could have an unfavorable impact on our future operating cash flows 

the level and quality of output from our refineries also impacts our cash flows factors such as operating efficiency maintenance turnarounds market conditions feedstock availability and weather conditions can affect output we actively manage the operations of our refineries and any variability in their operations typically has not been as significant to cash flows as that caused by margins and prices however the recent decline in demand for refined petroleum products has led to a reduction of our refinery production if the global economic disruption associated with the covid19 pandemic sustains we expect refinery production along with marketing transportation and terminaling volumes to remain challenged in the near term which could have an unfavorable impact on our future operating cash flows our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization was 76 94 and 95 in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

index to financial statements 

equity affiliate operating distributions 

our operating cash flows are also impacted by distribution decisions made by our equity affiliates including cpchem dcp midstream and wrb over the three years ended december 31 2020 our operating cash flows included aggregate distributions from our equity affiliates of 6406 million including 290 million from dcp midstream 2490 million from cpchem and 1230 million from wrb we cannot control the amount or timing of future distributions from equity affiliates therefore future distributions are not assured

our legal and tax matters are handled by our legal and tax organizations these organizations apply their knowledge experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases and uncertain tax positions we employ a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases and enables the tracking of those cases that have been scheduled for trial andor mediation based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals or establishment of new accruals is required in the case of income taxrelated contingencies we monitor tax legislation and court decisions the status of tax audits and the statute of limitations within which a taxing authority can assert a liability see note 21—income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about income taxrelated contingencies 

environmental 

we are subject to international federal state and local environmental laws and regulations among the most significant of these international and federal environmental laws and regulations are the 

  

• us federal clean air act which governs air emissions 

• us federal clean water act which governs discharges into water bodies 

• european union regulation for registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals reach which governs production marketing and use of chemicals 

• us federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla which imposes liability on generators transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur 

• us federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra which governs the treatment storage and disposal of solid waste 

• us federal emergency planning and community righttoknow act epcra which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories to local emergency planning committees and response departments 

index to financial statements 

• us federal oil pollution act of 1990 opa90 under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines as well as owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the united states 

• european union trading directive resulting in the european union emissions trading scheme eu ets which uses a marketbased mechanism to incentivize the reduction of greenhouse gas ghg emissions as well as the united kingdom emissions trading scheme uk ets which will replace the eu ets in the united kingdom beginning april 30 2021 

these laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and in the case of discharges to water establish water quality limits they also in most cases require permits in association with new or modified operations these permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process which can be expensive and time consuming in addition there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency’s processing of the application many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant 

other foreign countries and many states where we operate also have or are developing similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities while similar in some cases these regulations may impose additional or more stringent requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of developing infrastructure and marketing and transporting products across state and international borders for example in california the south coast air quality management district scaqmd approved amendments to the regional clean air incentives market reclaim that became effective in 2016 which require a phased reduction of nitrogen oxide emissions through 2022 affecting refineries in the los angeles metropolitan area in 2017 scaqmd required additional nitrogen dioxide emissions reductions through 2025 and is now promulgating new regulations to replace the reclaim program with a traditional command and control regulatory regime 

the ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards such as air emission standards water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations continue to evolve however environmental laws and regulations including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the united states and in other countries in which we operate notable areas of potential impacts include air emissions compliance and remediation obligations in the united states 

an example of this in the fuels area is the energy independence and security act of 2007 eisa it requires fuel producers and importers to provide additional renewable fuels for transportation motor fuels and stipulates a mix of various types rins form the mechanism used by the epa to record compliance with the renewable fuel standard if an obligated party has more rins than it needs to meet its obligation it may sell or trade the extra rins or instead choose to “bank” them for use the following year we have met the stringent requirements to date while establishing implementation operating and capital strategies along with advanced technology development to address projected future requirements it is uncertain how various future requirements contained in eisa and the regulations promulgated thereunder may be implemented and what their full impact may be on our operations for the 2020 compliance year the epa set volumes of advanced and total renewable fuels required to be blended into transportation fuels at higher levels than in previous years it is uncertain if these increased obligations will be achievable by fuel producers and shippers without drawing on the rin bank additionally we may experience a decrease in demand for refined petroleum products due to the regulatory program as currently promulgated this program continues to be the subject of possible congressional review and repromulgation in revised form and the epa’s regulations pertaining to the 2019 and 2020 compliance years are subject to legal challenge further creating uncertainty regarding renewable fuel volume requirements and obligations uncertainty also exists surrounding compliance year 2021 as the epa has not yet promulgated standards for that compliance year although we expect the epa to follow its past practice of using its authority to reduce the statutorily required volumes under eisa of advanced and total renewable fuels required to be blended into transportation fuels compliance with the regulation has been further complicated as the market for rins has been the subject of fraudulent thirdparty activity and it is possible that some rins that we have purchased may be determined to be invalid should that occur we could incur costs to replace those fraudulent rins although the cost for replacing any fraudulently marketed rins is not reasonably estimable at this time we would not expect such costs to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

index to financial statements 

we also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations such laws and regulations include cercla and rcra and their state equivalents remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility arising from petroleum releases from underground storage tanks located at numerous previously and currently owned andor operated petroleummarketing outlets throughout the united states federal and state laws require contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards in addition to other cleanup standards many states have adopted cleanup criteria for methyl tertiarybutyl ether mtbe for both soil and groundwater 

at rcrapermitted facilities we are required to assess environmental conditions if conditions warrant we may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations in contrast to cercla which is often referred to as “superfund” the cost of corrective action activities under rcra corrective action programs typically is borne solely by us we anticipate increased expenditures for rcra remediation activities may be required but such annual expenditures for the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures we have experienced over the past few years longerterm expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly 

we occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the epa and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under cercla or an equivalent state statute on occasion we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties these requests notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations as of december 31 2019 we reported that we had been notified of potential liability under cercla and comparable state laws at 27 sites within the united states during 2020 we were notified of one previously resolved site that was returned to active status and three sites that were deemed resolved and closed leaving 25 unresolved sites with potential liability at december 31 2020 

for the majority of superfund sites our potential liability will be less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties is relatively low although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations and where they have not or where potentially responsible parties could not be located our share of liability has not increased materially many of the sites for which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the epa or the state agencies concerned prior to actual cleanup those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation in some instances we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain the epa or equivalent state agency approval of a remediation plan there are relatively few sites where we are a major participant and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all cercla sites in the aggregate is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition 

expensed environmental costs were 610 million in 2020 and are expected to be approximately 720 million per year in 2021 and 2022 capitalized environmental costs were 131 million in 2020 and are expected to be approximately 105 million and 140 million in 2021 and 2022 respectively these amounts do not include capital expenditures made for other purposes that have an indirect benefit on environmental compliance 

accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted except those assumed in a business combination which we record on a discounted basis 

many of these liabilities result from cercla rcra and similar state laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct or once conducted operations or at sites where our generated waste was disposed we also have accrued for a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation but which are not currently the subject of cercla rcra or state enforcement activities if applicable we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other thirdparty recoveries in the future we may incur significant costs under both cercla and rcra remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site depending on the mix of unique site characteristics evolving remediation technologies diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties therefore it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs 

index to financial statements 

notwithstanding any of the foregoing and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in certain of our operations and products and there can be no assurance that those costs and liabilities will not be material however we currently do not expect any material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations 

climate change 

there has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state national and international laws focusing on ghg emissions reduction including various regulations proposed or issued by the epa these proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in states andor countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future laws regulating ghg emissions continue to evolve and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation such laws potentially could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition as a result of increasing costs of compliance lengthening project implementation and agency reviews or reducing demand for certain hydrocarbon products examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include 

  

• eu ets which is part of the european union’s policy to combat climate change and is a key tool for reducing industrial ghg emissions eu ets impacts factories power stations and other installations across all eu member states as a result of the united kingdom’s exit from the european union brexit those types of entities in the united kingdom will be subject to the uk ets rather than the eu ets beginning april 30 2021 

• california’s senate bill no 32 which requires reduction of californias ghg emissions to 40 below the 1990 emission level by 2030 and assembly bill 398 which extends the california ghg emission cap and trade program through 2030 other ghg emissions programs in the western us states have been enacted or are under consideration or development including amendments to californias low carbon fuel standard oregons low carbon fuel standard and washingtons carbon reduction programs 

• the us supreme court decision in massachusetts v epa  549 us 497 127 s ct 1438 2007 confirming that the epa has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an “air pollutant” under the federal clean air act 

• the epa’s announcement on march 29 2010 published as “interpretation of regulations that determine pollutants covered by clean air act permitting programs” 75 fed reg 17004 april 2 2010 and the epa’s and us department of transportation’s joint promulgation of a final rule on april 1 2010 that triggers regulation of ghgs under the clean air act these collectively may lead to more climatebased claims for damages and may result in longer agency review time for development projects to determine the extent of potential climate change 

• the epas 2015 final rule regulating ghg emissions from existing fossil fuelfired electrical generating units under the federal clean air act commonly referred to as the clean power plan the epa commenced rulemaking in 2017 to rescind the clean power plan and in august 2018 the epa proposed the affordable clean energy ace rule as its replacement on january 19 2021 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia invalidated the ace rule and remanded the matter to the epa essentially restarting this rulemaking process 

• carbon taxes in certain jurisdictions 

• ghg emission cap and trade programs in certain jurisdictions 

in the eu the first phase of the eu ets completed at the end of 2007 phase ii was undertaken from 2008 through 2012 and phase iii ran from 2013 through to 2020 phase iv runs from january 1 2021 through 2030 and sectors covered under the ets must reduce their ghg emissions by 43 compared to 2005 levels from april 30 2021 the united kingdom will no longer be part of the eu ets and has launched the uk ets phillips 66 has assets that are subject to the eu ets and assets that will be subject to the uk ets

from november 30 to december 12 2015 more than 190 countries including the united states participated in the united nations climate change conference in paris france the conference culminated in what is known as the “paris agreement” which upon certain conditions being met entered into force on november 4 2016 the paris agreement establishes a commitment by signatory parties to pursue domestic ghg emission reductions in 2017 president trump announced his intention to withdraw the united states from the paris agreement and that withdrawal became effective on november 4 2020 on january 20 2021 president biden signed the “acceptance on behalf of the united states of america” which allows the united states to rejoin the paris agreement the united states officially rejoined the paris agreement in february 2021 which could lead to additional ghg emission reduction requirements for sources in the united states 

in the united states some additional form of regulation is likely to be forthcoming in the future at the state or federal levels with respect to ghg emissions such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in additional financial burden in the form of taxes the restriction of output investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances 

compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a ghg emission trading program ghg reduction requirements or carbon taxes could significantly increase our costs reduce demand for fossil energy derived products impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources 

an example of one such program is california’s cap and trade program which was promulgated pursuant to the state’s global warming solutions act the program had been limited to certain stationary sources which include our refineries in california but beginning in january 2015 was expanded to include emissions from transportation fuels distributed in california inclusion of transportation fuels in california’s cap and trade program as currently promulgated has increased our cap and trade program compliance costs the ultimate impact on our financial performance either positive or negative from this and similar programs will depend on a number of factors including but not limited to 

  

• whether and to what extent legislation or regulation is enacted 

• the nature of the legislation or regulation such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions 

• the ghg reductions required 

• the price and availability of offsets 

• the demand for and amount and allocation of allowances 

• technological and scientific developments leading to new products or services 

• any potential significant physical effects of climate change such as increased severe weather events changes in sea levels and changes in temperature 

• whether and the extent to which increased compliance costs are ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services 

we consider and take into account anticipated future ghg emissions in designing and developing major facilities and projects and implement energy efficiency initiatives to reduce ghg emissions data on our ghg emissions legal requirements regulating such emissions and the possible physical effects of climate change on our coastal assets are incorporated into our planning investment and risk management decisionmaking we are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses see note 1—summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for descriptions of our major accounting policies some of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions or if different assumptions had been used the following discussion of critical accounting estimates along with the discussion of contingencies in this report address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions could be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change 

impairment of longlived assets and equity method investments 

longlived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future expected cash flows if the sum of the undiscounted expected future beforetax cash flows of an asset group is less than the carrying value including applicable liabilities the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for longlived assets the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined using one or more of the following methods the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants a market multiple for similar assets historical market transactions including similar assets adjusted using principal market participant assumptions when necessary or replacement cost adjusted for physical deterioration and economic obsolescence the expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments including future volumes commodity prices operating costs margins discount rates and capital project decisions considering all available information at the date of review 

investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are assessed for impairment when there are indicators of a loss in value such as a lack of sustained earnings capacity or a current fair value less than the investment’s carrying amount when it is determined that an indicated impairment is other than temporary a charge is recognized for the difference between the investment’s carrying value and its estimated fair value when determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary management considers factors such as the duration and extent of the decline the investee’s financial condition and nearterm prospects and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that allows for recovery when quoted market prices are not available the fair value is usually based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants and observed market earnings multiples of comparable companies if appropriate different assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period 

see note 9—impairments in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information about significant impairments recorded in 2020 and 2019 

asset retirement obligations 

under various contracts permits and regulations we have legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land at the end of operations at certain operational sites our largest asset removal obligations involve asbestos abatement at refineries estimating the timing and cost of future asset removals is difficult most of these removal obligations are many years or decades in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs asset removal technologies and costs regulatory and other compliance considerations expenditure timing and other inputs into valuation of the obligation including discount and inflation rates are also subject to change 

index to financial statements 

environmental costs 

in addition to asset retirement obligations discussed above we have certain obligations to complete environmentalrelated projects these projects are primarily related to cleanup at domestic refineries underground storage sites and nonoperated sites future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs timing and extent of such remedial actions that may be required and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties 

intangible assets and goodwill 

at december 31 2020 we had 725 million of intangible assets that we have determined to have indefinite useful lives and therefore do not amortize the judgmental determination that an intangible asset has an indefinite useful life is continuously evaluated if due to changes in facts and circumstances management determines these intangible assets have finite useful lives amortization will commence at that time on a prospective basis as long as these intangible assets are determined to have indefinite lives they will be subject to at least annual impairment tests that require management’s judgment of their estimated fair value 

at december 31 2020 we had 14 billion of goodwill recorded in conjunction with past business combinations goodwill is not amortized instead goodwill is subject to at least annual tests for impairment at a reporting unit level a reporting unit is an operating segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment and it is determined primarily based on the manner in which the business is managed 

we perform our annual goodwill impairment test using a qualitative assessment and a quantitative assessment if one is deemed necessary as part of our qualitative assessment we evaluate relevant events and circumstances that could affect the fair value of our reporting units including macroeconomic conditions overall industry and market considerations and regulatory changes as well as companyspecific market metrics performance and events the evaluation of companyspecific events and circumstances includes evaluating changes in our stock price and cost of capital actual and forecasted financial performance as well as the effect of significant asset dispositions if our qualitative assessment indicates it is likely the fair value of a reporting unit has declined below its carrying value including goodwill a quantitative assessment is performed 

when a quantitative assessment is performed management applies judgment in determining the estimated fair values of the reporting units because quoted market prices for our reporting units are not available management uses available information to make this fair value determination including estimated future cash flows cost of capital observed market earnings multiples of comparable companies our common stock price and associated total company market capitalization 

see note 9—impairments and note 16—fair value measurements in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the goodwill impairment we recorded in the first quarter of 2020 

we completed our annual qualitative assessment of goodwill as of october 1 2020 and concluded that the fair values of our reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values including goodwill a decline in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units in the future could result in an impairment as such we continue to monitor for indicators of impairment until our next annual impairment assessment is performed

tax assets and liabilities 

our operations are subject to various taxes including federal state and foreign income taxes property taxes and transactional taxes such as excise sales and use valueadded and payroll taxes we record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations the recording of tax liabilities requires significant judgment and estimates we recognize the financial statement effects of an income tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority a contingent liability related to a transactional tax claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and reasonably estimable actual incurred tax liabilities can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons including different interpretations of tax laws and regulations and different assessments of the amount of tax due 

in determining our income tax expense benefit we assess the likelihood our deferred tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income valuation allowances reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized judgment is required in estimating the amount of valuation allowance if any that should be recorded against our deferred tax assets based on our historical taxable income our expectations for the future and available taxplanning strategies we expect our net deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as reductions to future taxable income if our actual results of operations differ from such estimates or our estimates of future taxable income change the valuation allowance may need to be revised 

new tax laws and regulations as well as changes to existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being proposed or promulgated the implementation of future legislative and regulatory tax initiatives could result in increased income tax liabilities that cannot be predicted at this time 

projected benefit obligations 

calculation of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans impacts the obligations on the balance sheet and the amount of benefit expense in the statement of operations the actuarial calculation of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events including estimated retirement dates salary levels at retirement mortality rates lumpsum election rates rates of return on plan assets future interest rates future health care costtrend rates and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the calculation of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements due to the specialized nature of these calculations as financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies have different objectives and requirements the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects ultimately we will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions a one percentagepoint decrease in the discount rate assumption used for the plan obligation would increase annual benefit expense by an estimated 70 million while a one percentagepoint decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by an estimated 40 million in determining the discount rate we use yields on highquality fixed income investments with payments matched to the estimated distributions of benefits from our plans 

the expected weightedaverage longterm rate of return for worldwide pension plan assets was approximately 6 for both 2020 and 2019 while the actual weightedaverage rate of return was 12 in 2020 and 18 in 2019 for the past ten years our actual weightedaverage rate of return for worldwide pension plan assets was 9

refining 

our realized refining margins measure the difference between a sales and other operating revenues derived from the sale of petroleum products manufactured at our refineries and b costs of feedstocks primarily crude oil used to produce the petroleum products the realized refining margins are adjusted to include our proportional share of our joint venture refineries’ realized margins as well as to exclude those items that are not representative of the underlying operating performance of a period which we call “special items” the realized refining margins are converted to a perbarrel basis by dividing them by total refinery processed inputs primarily crude oil measured on a barrel basis including our share of inputs processed by our joint venture refineries our realized refining margin per barrel is intended to be comparable with industry refining margins which are known as “crack spreads” as discussed in “business environment” industry crack spreads measure the difference between market prices for refined petroleum products and crude oil we believe realized refining margin per barrel calculated on a similar basis as industry crack spreads provides a useful measure of how well we performed relative to benchmark industry refining margins 

the gaap performance measure most directly comparable to realized refining margin per barrel is the refining segment’s “income loss before income taxes per barrel” realized refining margin per barrel excludes items that are typically included in a manufacturer’s gross margin such as depreciation and operating expenses and other items used to determine income loss before income taxes such as general and administrative expenses it also includes our proportional share of joint venture refineries’ realized refining margins and excludes special items because realized refining margin per barrel is calculated in this manner and because realized refining margin per barrel may be defined differently by other companies in our industry it has limitations as an analytical tool following are reconciliations of income loss before income taxes to realized refining margins

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial instrument market risk 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are exposed to market risks produced by changes in the prices of crude oil refined petroleum products natural gas ngl and electric power as well as fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we and certain of our subsidiaries may hold and use derivative contracts to manage these risks 

commodity price risk 

generally our policy is to remain exposed to the market prices of commodities consistent with this policy we use derivative contracts to convert our exposure from fixedprice sales or purchase contracts often specified in contracts with refined petroleum product customers back to floating market prices we also use futures forwards swaps and options in various markets to accomplish the following objectives 

• balance physical systems or meet our refinery requirements and market demand in addition to cash settlement prior to contract expiration certain exchangetraded futures may be settled by physical delivery of the underlying commodity 

• enable us to use the market knowledge gained from our physical commodity market activities to capture market opportunities such as moving physical commodities to more profitable locations storing commodities to capture seasonal or time premiums and blending commodities to capture quality upgrades derivatives may be utilized to optimize these activities 

• manage the risk to our cash flows from price exposures on specific crude oil refined petroleum product natural gas and ngl transactions 

these objectives optimize the value of our supply chain and may reduce our exposure to fluctuations in market prices 

our use of derivative instruments is governed by an “authority limitations” document approved by our board of directors this document prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient market liquidity for comparable valuations and establishes value at risk var limits compliance with these limits is monitored daily by our global risk group 

we use a var model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative commodity instruments held or issued using monte carlo simulation a 95 confidence level and a oneday holding period the var for derivative commodity instruments issued or held at december 31 2020 and 2019 was immaterial to our cash flows and results of operations 

index to financial statements 

interest rate risk 

our use of fixed or variablerate debt directly exposes us to interest rate risk fixedrate debt such as our senior notes exposes us to changes in the fair value of our debt due to changes in market interest rates fixedrate debt also exposes us to the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at higher rates or that we may be obligated to pay rates higher than the current market variablerate debt such as our floatingrate notes or borrowings under our revolving credit facility exposes us to shortterm changes in market rates that impact our interest expense the following tables provide information about our debt instruments that are sensitive to changes in us interest rates these tables present principal cash flows and related weightedaverage interest rates by expected maturity dates weightedaverage variable rates are based on effective rates at each reporting date the carrying amount of our floatingrate debt approximates its fair value the fair value of the fixedrate financial instruments is estimated based on observable market prices 





our chief executive officer and chief financial officer monitor risks resulting from commodity prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates

cautionary statement for the purposes of the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

this report includes forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 you can normally identify our forwardlooking statements by the words “anticipate” “estimate” “believe” “budget” “continue” “could” “intend” “may” “plan” “potential” “predict” “seek” “should” “will” “would” “expect” “objective” “projection” “forecast” “goal” “guidance” “outlook” “effort” “target” and similar expressions but the absence of such words does not mean a statement is not forwardlooking 

we based the forwardlooking statements on our current expectations estimates and projections about us our operations our joint ventures and entities in which we have equity interests as well as the industries in which we and they operate in general we caution you these statements are not guarantees of future performance as they involve assumptions that while made in good faith may prove to be incorrect and involve risks and uncertainties we cannot predict in addition we based many of these forwardlooking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate accordingly our actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what we have expressed or forecast in the forwardlooking statements any differences could result from a variety of factors including the following 

• the continuing effects of the covid19 pandemic and its negative impact on commercial activity and demand for refined petroleum products as well as the extent and duration of recovery of economies and demand for our products after the pandemic subsides 

• fluctuations in ngl crude oil refined petroleum product and natural gas prices and refining marketing and petrochemical margins 

• changes in governmental policies relating to ngl crude oil natural gas or refined petroleum products pricing regulation or taxation including exports 

• actions taken by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec and other countries impacting supply and demand and correspondingly commodity prices

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form 10k each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition as well as the value of an investment in our common stock 

our operating results and future rate of growth are exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices and refining marketing and petrochemical margins 

our revenues operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent on a number of factors including fixed and variable expenses including the cost of crude oil ngl and other refining and petrochemical feedstocks and the margin we can derive from selling refined petroleum petrochemical and plastics products the prices of feedstocks and our products fluctuate substantially these prices depend on numerous factors beyond our control including the global supply and demand for feedstocks and our products which are subject to among other things 

  

 

the price of crude oil influences prices for refined petroleum products we do not produce crude oil and must purchase all of the crude oil we process many crude oils available on the world market will not meet the quality restrictions for use in our refineries others are not economical to use due to high transportation costs or for other reasons the prices for crude oil and refined petroleum products can fluctuate differently based on global regional and local market conditions as well as by type and class of products which can reduce refining margins and could have a significant impact on our refining wholesale marketing and retail operations revenues operating income and cash flows also crude oil supply contracts generally have marketresponsive pricing provisions we normally purchase our refinery feedstocks weeks before manufacturing and selling the refined petroleum products changes in prices that occur between when we purchase feedstocks and when we sell the refined petroleum products produced from these feedstocks could have a significant effect on our financial results we also purchase refined petroleum products produced by others for sale to our customers price changes that occur between when we purchase and sell these refined petroleum products also could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the price of feedstocks also influences prices for petrochemical and plastics products although our chemicals segment transports and fractionates feedstocks to meet a portion of their demand and has certain longterm feedstock supply contracts with others it is still subject to volatile feedstock prices in addition the petrochemicals industry is both cyclical and volatile cyclicality occurs when periods of tight supply resulting in increased prices and profit margins are followed by periods of capacity expansion resulting in oversupply and declining prices and profit margins volatility occurs as a result of changes in supply and demand for products changes in energy prices and changes in various other economic conditions around the world

we expect to continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of our compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations likewise future environmental laws and regulations may impact or limit our current business plans and reduce demand for our products 

our business is subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment these laws and regulations continue to increase in both number and complexity and affect our operations with respect to among other things 

  

 

we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital operating and maintenance and remediation expenditures as a result of these laws and regulations to the extent these expenditures as with all costs are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in future periods could be materially adversely affected 

the us environmental protection agency epa has implemented a renewable fuel standard rfs pursuant to the energy policy act of 2005 and the energy independence and security act of 2007 the rfs program sets annual quotas for the quantity of renewable fuels such as ethanol that must be blended into motor fuels consumed in the united states to provide certain flexibility in compliance options available to the industry a renewable identification number rin is assigned to each gallon of renewable fuel produced in or imported into the united states as a producer of petroleumbased motor fuels we are obligated to blend renewable fuels into the products we produce at a rate that is at least commensurate to the epa’s quota and to the extent we do not we must purchase rins in the open market to satisfy our obligation under the rfs program to the extent the epa mandates a blending quantity of renewable fuel that exceeds the amount that is commercially feasible to blend into motor fuel a situation commonly referred to as “the blend wall” our operations could be materially adversely impacted up to and including a reduction in produced motor fuel 

the adoption of climate change legislation or regulation could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the refined petroleum products we produce 

the us government including the epa as well as several state and international governments have either considered or adopted legislation or regulations in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas ghg emissions these proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in states andor countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future in addition various groups suggest that additional laws may be needed in an effort to address climate change as illustrated by the paris agreement which entered into force on november 4 2016 and establishes a commitment by signatory parties to pursue domestic ghg emission reductions although the united states submitted formal notification of its withdrawal from the paris agreement to the united nations in november 2019 a future presidential administration could reverse the withdrawal we cannot predict the extent to which any such legislation or regulation will be enacted and if so what its provisions would be to the extent we incur additional costs required to comply with the adoption of new laws and regulations that are not ultimately recovered in the prices of our products and services our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in future periods could be materially adversely affected in addition demand for the refined petroleum products we produce could be adversely affected

climate change may adversely affect our and our joint ventures’ facilities and ongoing operations 

the potential physical effects of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and depend upon the unique geographic and environmental factors present we have systems in place to manage potential acute physical risks but if any such events were to occur they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations examples of potential physical risks include floods hurricaneforce winds wildfires and snowstorms as well as rising sea levels at our coastal facilities we and our joint ventures have incurred and will continue to incur costs to protect our assets from physical risks and to employ processes to the extent available to mitigate such risks many of our facilities as well as facilities of our joint ventures are located near coastal areas as a result extreme weather and rising sea levels may disrupt our or our joint ventures’ ability to operate those facilities or transport crude oil and refined petroleum products extended periods of such disruption could have an adverse effect on our results of operations we could also incur substantial costs to prevent or repair damage to these facilities finally depending on the severity and duration of any extreme weather events or climate conditions we or our joint ventures could be required to modify operations and incur costs that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

political and economic developments could affect our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows 

actions of federal state local and international governments through legislation or regulation executive order permit or other review of infrastructure or facility development and commercial restrictions could delay projects increase costs limit development or otherwise reduce our operating profitability both in the united states and abroad any such actions may affect many aspects of our operations including 

 

in addition the us government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries and from doing business with entities affiliated with foreign governments which can include state oil companies and us subsidiaries of those companies the office of foreign assets control ofac of the us department of the treasury administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on us foreign policy and national security matters for example sanctions are currently in effect against venezuela and certain entities affiliated with it the effect of any such ofac sanctions could disrupt transactions with or operations involving entities affiliated with sanctioned countries and could limit our ability to obtain optimum crude slates and other refinery feedstocks and effectively distribute refined petroleum products 

other risks inherent in doing business internationally include global financial market turmoil economic volatility and global economic slowdown currency exchange rate fluctuations and inflationary pressures import or export restrictions and changes in trade regulations acts of terrorism war civil unrest and other political risks difficulties in developing staffing and managing foreign operations and potentially adverse tax developments if any of these events occur our businesses and those of our joint ventures may be adversely affected 

additionally renewable fuels alternative energy mandates and energy conservation efforts could reduce demand for refined petroleum products tax incentives and other subsidies can make renewable fuels and alternative energy more competitive with refined petroleum products than they otherwise might be which may reduce refined petroleum product margins and hinder the ability of refined petroleum products to compete with renewable fuels

large capital projects can take many years to complete and market conditions could deteriorate significantly between the project approval date and the project startup date negatively impacting expected project returns 

our basis for approving a largescale capital project is the expectation that it will deliver an acceptable level of return on the capital invested we base these forecasted project economics on our best estimate of future market conditions most largescale projects take several years to complete during this multiyear period market conditions can change from those we forecast and these changes could be significant accordingly we may not be able to realize our expected returns from a large investment in a capital project and this could negatively impact our results of operations cash flows and our return on capital employed 

plans we may have to expand existing assets or construct new assets particularly in our midstream segment are subject to risks associated with societal and political pressures and other forms of opposition to the future development transportation and use of carbonbased fuels such risks could adversely impact our ability to realize certain growth strategies 

certain of our planned expenditures are based upon the assumption that societal sentiment will continue to enable and existing regulations will remain intact to allow for the future development transportation and use of carbonbased fuels a portion of our growth strategy is dependent on our ability to expand existing assets and to construct additional assets policy decisions relating to the production refining transportation and marketing of carbonbased fuels are subject to political pressures and the influence and protests of environmental and other special interest groups for example our midstream segment’s growth plans include the construction or expansion of pipelines which can involve numerous regulatory environmental political and legal uncertainties many of which are beyond our control our growth projects may not be completed on schedule or at the budgeted cost in addition our revenues may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs could negatively impact our results of operations cash flows and our return on capital employed 

our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses failure to manage risks associated with business interruptions could adversely impact our operations financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our operations are subject to business interruptions due to scheduled refinery turnarounds unplanned maintenance or unplanned events such as explosions fires refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents power outages severe weather labor disputes or other natural or manmade disasters such as acts of terrorism including cyber intrusion the inability to operate one or more of our facilities due to any of these events could significantly impair our ability to manufacture our products additionally our manufacturing equipment is becoming increasingly dependent on our information technology systems a disruption in our information technology systems due to a catastrophic event or security breach could interrupt or damage our operations 

explosions fires refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents involving our assets or operations could result in serious personal injury or loss of human life significant damage to property and equipment environmental pollution impairment of operations and substantial losses to us for assets located near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers industrial sites and other public gathering areas the level of damage resulting from these risks could be greater damages resulting from an incident involving any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially substantial claims or in our being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities should any of these risks materialize at any of our equity affiliates it could have a material adverse effect on the business and financial condition of the equity affiliate and negatively impact their ability to make future distributions to us 

index to financial statements 

there are certain hazards and risks inherent in our operations that could adversely affect those operations and our financial results 

the operation of refineries power plants fractionators pipelines terminals and vessels is inherently subject to the risks of spills discharges or other inadvertent releases of petroleum or hazardous substances if any of these events had previously occurred or occurs in the future in connection with any of our refineries pipelines or refined petroleum products terminals or in connection with any facilities that receive our wastes or byproducts for treatment or disposal other than events for which we are indemnified we could be liable for all costs and penalties associated with their remediation under federal state local and international environmental laws or common law and could be liable for property damage to third parties caused by contamination from releases and spills 

we do not insure against all potential losses and therefore our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by unexpected liabilities and increased costs 

we maintain insurance coverage in amounts we believe to be prudent against many but not all potential liabilities arising from operating hazards uninsured liabilities arising from operating hazards including but not limited to explosions fires refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents involving our assets or operations could reduce the funds available to us for capital and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our investments in joint ventures decrease our ability to manage risk 

we conduct some of our operations including parts of our midstream refining and ms segments and our entire chemicals segment through joint ventures in which we share control with our joint venture participants our joint venture participants may have economic business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours or those of the joint venture or our joint venture participants may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone failure by us or an entity in which we have a joint venture interest to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisitions or joint ventures could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our joint ventures and in turn our business and operations 

we are subject to interruptions of supply and increased costs as a result of our reliance on thirdparty transportation of crude oil ngl and refined petroleum products 

we often utilize the services of third parties to transport crude oil ngl and refined petroleum products to and from our facilities in addition to our own operational risks discussed above we could experience interruptions of supply or increases in costs to deliver refined petroleum products to market if the ability of the pipelines or vessels to transport crude oil or refined petroleum products is disrupted because of weather events accidents governmental regulations or thirdparty actions a prolonged disruption of the ability of a pipeline or vessel to transport crude oil ngl or refined petroleum products to or from one or more of our refineries or other facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in us production of crude oil and natural gas which could adversely impact our results of operations 

an increasing percentage of crude oil supplied to our refineries and the crude oil and gas production of our midstream segment’s customers is being produced from unconventional oil shale reservoirs these reservoirs require hydraulic fracturing completion processes to release the hydrocarbons from the rock so they can flow through casing to the surface hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water sand and chemicals under pressure into a formation to stimulate hydrocarbon production the epa as well as several state agencies have commenced studies andor convened hearings regarding the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities at the same time certain environmental groups have suggested that additional laws may be needed to more closely and uniformly regulate the hydraulic fracturing process and legislation has been proposed to provide for such regulation in addition some communities have adopted measures to ban hydraulic fracturing in their communities we cannot predict whether any such legislation will ever be enacted and if so what its provisions would be any additional levels of regulation and permits required with the adoption of new laws and regulations at the federal or state level could result in our having to rely on higher priced crude oil for our refineries this could lead to delays increased operating costs and process prohibitions that could reduce the volumes of natural gas that move through dcp midstream’s gathering systems and could reduce supplies and increase costs of ngl feedstocks to cpchem’s facilities this could materially adversely affect our results of operations and the ability of dcp midstream and cpchem to make cash distributions to us 

dcp midstream’s success depends on its ability to obtain new sources of natural gas and ngl any decrease in the volumes of natural gas dcp midstream gathers could adversely affect its business and operating results 

dcp midstream’s gathering and transportation pipeline systems are connected to or dependent on the level of production from natural gas wells which naturally declines over time as a result its cash flows associated with these wells will also decline over time in order to maintain or increase throughput levels on its gathering and transportation pipeline systems and ngl pipelines and the asset utilization rates at its natural gas processing plants dcp midstream must continually obtain new supplies the primary factors affecting dcp midstream’s ability to obtain new supplies of natural gas and ngl and to attract new customers to its assets include the level of successful drilling activity near these assets prices of and the demand for natural gas and crude oil producers’ desire and ability to obtain necessary permits in an efficient manner natural gas field characteristics and production performance surface access and infrastructure issues and its ability to compete for volumes from successful new wells if dcp midstream is not able to obtain new supplies of natural gas to replace the natural decline in volumes from existing wells or because of competition throughput on its pipelines and the utilization rates of its treating and processing facilities would decline this could have a material adverse effect on its business results of operations financial position and cash flows and its ability to make cash distributions to us 

competitors that produce their own supply of feedstocks have more extensive retail outlets or have greater financial resources may have a competitive advantage 

the refining and marketing industry is highly competitive with respect to both feedstock supply and refined petroleum product markets we compete with many companies for available supplies of crude oil and other feedstocks and for outlets for our refined petroleum products we do not produce any of our crude oil feedstocks some of our competitors however obtain a portion of their feedstocks from their own production and some have more extensive retail outlets than we have competitors that have their own production or extensive retail outlets and greater brandname recognition are at times able to offset losses from refining operations with profits from producing or retailing operations and may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages 

some of our competitors also have materially greater financial and other resources than we have such competitors have a greater ability to bear the economic risks inherent in all phases of our business in addition we compete with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel requirements of our industrial commercial and individual customers 

index to financial statements 

we may incur losses as a result of our forward contracts and derivative transactions 

we currently use commodity derivative instruments and we expect to use them in the future if the instruments we utilize to hedge our exposure to various types of risk are not effective we may incur losses derivative transactions involve the risk that counterparties may be unable to satisfy their obligations to us the risk of counterparty default is heightened in a poor economic environment 

one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of a publicly traded master limited partnership phillips 66 partners which may involve a greater exposure to legal liability than our historic business operations 

one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of phillips 66 partners a publicly traded master limited partnership our control of the general partner of phillips 66 partners may increase the possibility that we could be subject to claims of breach of fiduciary duties including claims of conflicts of interest related to phillips 66 partners any liability resulting from such claims could have a material adverse effect on our future business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability which would cause our business and reputation to suffer 

in the ordinary course of our business we collect sensitive data including personally identifiable information of our customers and employees despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure  or information technology and infrastructure of our thirdparty service providers eg cloudbased service providers may be vulnerable to attacks by malicious actors or breached due to human error malfeasance or other disruptions although we have experienced occasional actual or attempted breaches of our cybersecurity none of these breaches has had a material effect on our business operations or reputation or compromised any customer data any such breaches could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability under laws that protect the privacy of customer information including the european union’s general data protection regulation disrupt the services we provide to customers and damage our reputation any of which could adversely affect our business 

uncertainty and illiquidity in credit and capital markets can impair our ability to obtain credit and financing on acceptable terms and can adversely affect the financial strength of our business partners 

our ability to obtain credit and capital depends in large measure on the state of the credit and capital markets which is beyond our control our ability to access credit and capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like or need access to those markets which could constrain our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions in addition the cost and availability of debt and equity financing may be adversely impacted by unstable or illiquid market conditions protracted uncertainty and illiquidity in these markets also could have an adverse impact on our lenders commodity transaction counterparties or our customers preventing them from meeting their obligations to us 

from time to time our cash needs may exceed our internally generated cash flow and our business could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to obtain necessary funds from financing activities from time to time we may need to supplement cash generated from operations with proceeds from financing activities uncertainty and illiquidity in financial markets may materially impact the ability of the participating financial institutions to fund their commitments to us under our liquidity facilities that are supported by a broad syndicate of financial institutions accordingly we may not be able to obtain the full amount of the funds available under our liquidity facilities to satisfy our cash requirements and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position 

index to financial statements 

deterioration in our credit profile could increase our costs of borrowing money and limit our access to the capital markets and commercial credit and could trigger coventurer rights under joint venture arrangements 

our or phillips 66 partners’ credit ratings could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment the circumstances warrant if a rating agency were to downgrade our rating below investment grade our or phillips 66 partners’ borrowing costs would increase and our funding sources could decrease in addition a failure by us to maintain an investment grade rating could affect our business relationships with suppliers and operating partners for example our agreement with chevron regarding cpchem permits chevron to buy our 50 interest in cpchem for fair market value if we experience a change in control or if both standard  poor’s financial services llc and moody’s investors service inc lower our credit ratings below investment grade and the credit rating from either rating agency remains below investment grade for 365 days thereafter with fair market value determined by agreement or by nationally recognized investment banks as a result of these factors a downgrade of credit ratings could have a materially adverse impact on our future operations and financial position 

the level of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the expected return on plan assets for our pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans are evaluated by us based on a variety of independent sources of market information and in consultation with outside actuaries if we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected longterm rate of return or health care cost trend rate our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses and funding requirements could increase in addition several factors could cause actual results to differ significantly from the actuarial assumptions that we use funding obligations are determined based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date as required under relevant regulations future pension funding requirements and the timing of funding payments could be affected by legislation enacted by governmental authorities 

we are subject to continuing contingent liabilities of conocophillips following the separation relating to taxes and other matters if we become obligated we may need to use cash to meet these obligations and our financial results could be negatively impacted further conocophillips has indemnified us for certain matters but may not be able to satisfy its obligations to us in the future 

notwithstanding the separation there are several significant areas where the liabilities of conocophillips may become our obligations for example under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code and the related rules and regulations each corporation that was a member of the conocophillips consolidated us federal income tax reporting group during any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the effective time of the separation is jointly and severally liable for the us federal income tax liability of the entire conocophillips consolidated tax reporting group for that taxable period in connection with the separation we entered into the tax sharing agreement with conocophillips that allocates the responsibility for prior period taxes of the conocophillips consolidated tax reporting group between us and conocophillips conocophillips may be unable to pay any prior period taxes for which it is responsible and we could be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes other provisions of federal law establish similar liability for other matters including laws governing taxqualified pension plans as well as other contingent liabilities 

also pursuant to the tax sharing agreement we agreed to be responsible for and indemnify conocophillips with respect to all taxes arising as a result of the separation and certain related transactions failing to qualify under sections 368a and 355 of the code for us federal income tax purposes to the extent such tax liability arises as a result of any breach of any representation warranty covenant or other obligation by us or certain affiliates made in connection with the issuance of the private letter ruling relating to the separation or in the tax sharing agreement our indemnification obligations to conocophillips and its subsidiaries officers and directors are not limited by any maximum amount if we are required to indemnify conocophillips or such other persons under the circumstances set forth in the tax sharing agreement we may be subject to substantial liabilities 

index to financial statements 

pursuant to an indemnification and release agreement and certain other agreements with conocophillips entered into in connection with the separation conocophillips agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities and we agreed to indemnify conocophillips for certain liabilities indemnities that we may be required to provide conocophillips are not subject to any cap may be significant and could negatively impact our business particularly indemnities relating to our actions that could impact the taxfree nature of the distribution of phillips 66 stock third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that conocophillips has agreed to retain further the indemnity from conocophillips may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities and conocophillips may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations moreover even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from conocophillips any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves each of these risks could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition

 item 3 legal proceedings 

item 103 of regulation sk promulgated by the us securities and exchange commission sec requires disclosure of certain environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and such proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions unless we reasonably believe that the matter will result in no monetary sanctions or in monetary sanctions exclusive of interest and costs of less than 100000 the following matters are disclosed in accordance with that requirement we do not currently believe that the eventual outcome of any such matters individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

our us refineries are implementing two separate consent decrees regarding alleged violations of the federal clean air act with the us environmental protection agency epa three states and one local air pollution agency some of the requirements and limitations contained in the decrees provide for stipulated penalties for violations stipulated penalties under the decrees are not automatic but must be requested by one of the agency signatories as part of periodic reports under the decrees or other reports required by permits or regulations we occasionally report matters that could be subject to a request for stipulated penalties if a specific request for stipulated penalties meeting the sec reporting threshold described above is made pursuant to these decrees based on a given reported exceedance we will separately report that matter and the amount of the proposed penalty 

new matters 

on january 6 2020 the california state water resources control water board issued a penalty demand of 558300 to resolve the rodeo refinery’s national pollutant discharge elimination system permit requirement exceedance for total suspended solids that occurred following heavy rains on february 14 2019 we are working with the water board to resolve this matter 

matters previously reported unresolved or resolved since the quarterly report on form 10q for the quarterly period ended september 30 2019

business environment 

the midstream segment includes our transportation and natural gas liquids ngl businesses our transportation business contains feebased operations that are not directly exposed to commodity price risk our ngl business is directly linked to ngl prices the midstream segment also includes our 50 equity investment in dcp midstream llc dcp midstream ngl prices were significantly lower in 2019 compared with 2018 due to higher inventory levels resulting from supply growth and weak winter demand 

  

the chemicals segment consists of our 50 equity investment in cpchem the chemicals and plastics industry is mainly a commoditybased industry where the margins for key products are based on supply and demand as well as cost factors during 2019  the benchmark highdensity polyethylene chain margin further decreased compared with 2018 due to recent capacity additions the continued trade policy uncertainty and slower demand growth in asia 

our refining segment results are driven by several factors including refining margins refinery throughput feedstock costs product yields turnaround activity and other operating costs the price of us benchmark crude oil west texas intermediate wti at cushing oklahoma decreased to an average of 5702 per barrel during 2019  compared with an average of 6492 per barrel in 2018  due to continued growth in permian basin production and higher inventories as exports failed to keep pace with production growth in addition heavy canadian crude differentials narrowed in 2019 compared with 2018 due primarily to production curtailments implemented by the alberta provincial government market crack spreads are used as indicators of refining margins and measure the difference between market prices for refined petroleum products and crude oil during 2019  the market crack spreads slightly decreased in the atlantic basineurope gulf coast and central corridor regions but increased in the west coast region compared with 2018  

results for our ms segment depend largely on marketing fuel margins lubricant margins and other specialty product margins while ms margins are primarily driven by market factors largely determined by the relationship between supply and demand marketing fuel margins in particular are influenced by the trend in spot prices for refined petroleum products generally speaking a downward trend of spot prices has a favorable impact on marketing fuel margins while an upward trend of spot prices has an unfavorable impact on marketing fuel margins

2019 vs 2018 

sales and other operating revenues and purchased crude oil and products decreased 4 and 2  respectively in 2019  the decreases were mainly driven by lower prices for refined petroleum products crude oil and ngl 

equity in earnings of affiliates decreased 21 in 2019  the decrease was mainly due to lower margins at wrb refining lp wrb and cpchem partially offset by improved results from our transportation and ngl joint venture assets lower equity earnings in 2019 also reflected lowerofcostormarket inventory writedowns at cpchem and higher goodwill and other asset impairments at dcp midstream see the “segment results” section for additional information 

other income increased 58 million in 2019  the increase was mainly driven by trading activities not directly related to our physical business see note 15—derivatives and financial instruments  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information associated with our commodity derivatives 

  

impairments increased 853 million in 2019 the increase was driven by an 853 million pretax impairment associated with our investment in dcp midstream recognized in the third quarter of 2019 see note 7—investments loans and longterm receivables  and note 16—fair value measurements  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information associated with this impairment 

interest and debt expense decreased 9 in 2019  the decrease was primarily attributable to higher capitalized interest associated with capital projects under development in our midstream segment partially offset by higher debt balances in 2019 

income tax expense benefit decreased 49 in 2019 the decrease in income tax expense was primarily attributable to lower income before income taxes see note 21—income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our income taxes 

index to financial statements 

2018 vs 2017 

sales and other operating revenues and purchased crude oil and products increased 9 and 23  respectively in 2018  the increases were mainly due to higher prices for refined petroleum products crude oil and ngl the increase in sales and other operating revenues was partially offset by a change in the presentation of excise taxes on sales of refined petroleum products resulting from our adoption of financial accounting standard board fasb accounting standards update asu no 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers topic 606” on january 1 2018 as part of our adoption of this asu prospectively from january 1 2018 our presentation of excise taxes on sales of refined petroleum products changed to a net basis from a gross basis as a result the “sales and other operating revenues” and “taxes other than income taxes” line items on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december 31 2018  are not presented on a comparable basis to the year ended december 31 2017  see note 1—summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our presentation of excise taxes on sales of refined petroleum products and our adoption of this asu respectively 

equity in earnings of affiliates increased 55 in 2018  primarily resulting from higher equity in earnings from wrb cpchem and affiliates in our midstream segment 

 

other income decreased 460 million in 2018  we recognized a noncash pretax gain of 423 million in february 2017 related to the consolidation of merey sweeny see note 6—business combinations  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

taxes other than income taxes decreased 97 in 2018  the decrease was primarily attributable to the change in our presentation of excise taxes on sales of refined petroleum products resulting from our adoption of asu no 201409 on january 1 2018 see the “sales and other operating revenues” section above for further discussion 

interest and debt expense increased 15 in 2018  the increase was due to higher average debt principal balances resulting from our issuance of senior notes totaling 1500 million in march 2018 and phillips 66 partners’ issuance of senior notes totaling 650 million in october 2017 

income tax expense benefit was an expense in 2018  compared with a benefit in 2017  the benefit in 2017 was due to the recognition of a provisional income tax benefit of 2735 million from the enactment of the tax act in december 2017 the benefit from the tax act was primarily due to the revaluation of deferred income taxes excluding this benefit income tax expense increased in 2018 due to higher income before income taxes partially offset by the reduction of the us federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 beginning january 1 2018 as a result of the tax act see note 21—income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our income taxes 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased 136 million in 2018  primarily due to the contribution of assets in the fourth quarter of 2017 in october 2017 we contributed to phillips 66 partners our 25 ownership interest in both dakota access llc dakota access and energy transfer crude oil company llc etco and our 100 ownership interest in merey sweeny

 based on index prices from the mont belvieu market hub which are weighted by ngl component mix 

the midstream segment provides crude oil and refined petroleum product transportation terminaling and processing services as well as natural gas and ngl transportation storage fractionation processing and marketing services mainly in the united states this segment includes our master limited partnership mlp phillips 66 partners as well as our 50 equity investment in dcp midstream which includes the operations of its mlp dcp midstream lp dcp partners 

2019 vs 2018 

pretax income from the midstream segment decreased 497 million in 2019  compared with 2018  mainly driven by an 853 million pretax impairment associated with our investment in dcp midstream and lower equity earnings from dcp midstream partially offset by improved results from our transportation and ngl and other businesses 

pretax income from our transportation business increased 176 million in 2019  compared with 2018  the increase was mainly driven by higher volumes and pipeline tariffs from our portfolio of consolidated and joint venture assets 

pretax income from our ngl and other business increased 217 million in 2019  compared with 2018  the increase was mainly due to improved margins and volumes primarily at the sweeny hub and higher equity earnings from certain pipeline affiliates driven by higher volumes 

index to financial statements 

pretax income from our investment in dcp midstream decreased 890 million in 2019  compared with 2018  the decrease was primarily due to an 853 million pretax impairment associated with our investment in dcp midstream and lower equity earnings driven by higher goodwill and other asset impairments at dcp partners in 2019 as described below 

in the third quarter of 2019 dcp partners performed goodwill and other asset impairment assessments based on internal discounted cash flow models that reflected various observable and nonobservable factors such as prices volumes expenses and discount rates as a result of these assessments dcp partners recorded goodwill and other asset impairments that reduced our equity earnings by 47 million included in the “equity in earnings of affiliates” line item on our consolidated statement of income 

the fair value of our investment in dcp midstream at september 30 2019 depended on the market value of dcp midstream’s general partner interest in dcp partners and the market value of dcp partners’ common units at june 30 2019 we estimated the fair value of our investment in dcp midstream was below our book value but we believed the condition was temporary the fair value of our investment in dcp midstream further deteriorated in the third quarter as the market value of dcp midstream’s general partner interest in dcp partners and the market value of dcp partners’ common units declined further at that time we concluded the decline in fair value was no longer temporary due to the duration and magnitude of the decline accordingly we recorded an 853 million impairment in the third quarter of 2019  the impairment is included in the “impairments” line item on our consolidated statement of income and results in our investment in dcp midstream having a book value of 1374 million at december 31 2019  

the majority of the difference between the book value of our investment in dcp midstream and our 50 share of the net assets reported by dcp midstream is amortized over a 22year estimated useful life as an annual increase of approximately 40 million to equity earnings see note 7—investments loans and longterm receivables  and note 16—fair value measurements  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on our investment in dcp midstream

2018 vs 2017 

pretax income from the midstream segment increased 543 million in 2018  compared with 2017  due to improved results across all business lines 

pretax income from our transportation business increased 240 million in 2018  compared with 2017  the increase was mainly driven by higher volumes tariffs and storage rates from our portfolio of consolidated and joint venture assets these increases were partially offset by a decrease in equity earnings from rockies express pipeline llc rex due to a favorable settlement recorded in 2017 

pretax income from our ngl and other business increased 273 million in 2018  compared with 2017  the increase was primarily due to the contribution of merey sweeny to phillips 66 partners in october 2017 inventory impacts improved cargo margins and volumes and higher equity earnings from pipeline affiliates due to increased volumes 

pretax income from our investment in dcp midstream increased 30 million in 2018  compared with 2017  the increase was primarily due to higher equity earnings from affiliates as a result of increased volumes timing of incentive distribution income allocations from dcp partners and favorable hedging results these increases were partially offset by higher asset impairments and operating costs in 2018

chemicals 

  



the chemicals segment consists of our 50 interest in cpchem which we account for under the equity method cpchem uses ngl and other feedstocks to produce petrochemicals these products are then marketed and sold or used as feedstocks to produce plastics and other chemicals we structure our reporting of cpchem’s operations around two primary business lines olefins and polyolefins op and specialties aromatics and styrenics sas the op business line produces and markets ethylene and other olefin products ethylene produced is primarily consumed within cpchem for the production of polyethylene normal alpha olefins and polyethylene pipe the sas business line manufactures and markets aromatics and styrenics products such as benzene cyclohexane styrene and polystyrene sas also manufactures andor markets a variety of specialty chemical products unless otherwise noted amounts referenced below reflect our net 50 interest in cpchem 

2019 vs 2018 

pretax income from the chemicals segment decreased 146 million in 2019  compared with 2018  the decrease was mainly due to lower polyethylene margins attributable to additional industry capacity and slower demand growth in asia in addition cpchem recorded lowerofcostormarket writedowns of lifovalued inventories during 2019 and our portion of the writedowns reduced our equity earnings from cpchem by 65 million  pretax the decreases were partially offset by higher polyethylene sales volumes and lower turnaround and maintenance activity during 2019 

see the “executive overview and business environment” section for information on market factors impacting cpchem’s 2019 results 

2018 vs 2017 

pretax income from the chemicals segment increased 309 million in 2018  compared with 2017  the increased results reflected the commencement of full operations at cpchem’s new us gulf coast petrochemicals assets in the second quarter of 2018 which resulted in higher production and sales of polyethylene and ethylene partially offset by lower capitalized interest additionally lower hurricanerelated costs and downtime as well as lower impairment charges contributed to the increased results in 2018

the refining segment refines crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products such as gasoline distillates and aviation fuels at 13 refineries in the united states and europe 

2019 vs 2018 

pretax income for the refining segment decreased 2549 million in 2019  compared with 2018  the decrease was primarily driven by lower realized refining margins and lower refinery production at certain refineries due to turnaround activities and unplanned downtime in 2019  the decrease in realized refining margins was primarily due to lower feedstock advantage driven by narrowing heavy crude differentials 

see the “executive overview and business environment” section for information on industry crack spreads and other market factors impacting this year’s results 

our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 94 and 95 in 2019 and 2018  respectively

2018 vs 2017 

pretax income for the refining segment increased 2459 million in 2018  compared with 2017  the increase was primarily due to higher realized refining margins partially offset by a noncash gain of 423 million recognized from the consolidation of merey sweeny in february 2017 

the increased realized refining margins were primarily driven by higher feedstock advantage improved premium coke margins and increased optimization benefits from using our integrated logistics network to capture market opportunities related to widening bakken canadian and other inland crude differentials improved clean product differentials and lower renewable identification number rin costs also benefited margins these items were partially offset by a decline in market crack spreads 

our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 95 in both 2018 and 2017

corporate and other 

  



2019 vs 2018 

net interest expense consists of interest and financing expense net of interest income and capitalized interest net interest expense decreased 44 million in 2019  compared with 2018  primarily due to higher capitalized interest related to capital projects under development in our midstream segment partially offset by higher debt balances in 2019 

corporate overhead and other includes general and administrative expenses technology costs environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation foreign currency transaction gains and losses and other costs not directly associated with an operating segment during 2019  corporate overhead and other decreased 5 million  compared with 2018  

2018 vs 2017 

net interest expense increased 51 million in 2018  compared with 2017  mainly due to higher average debt principal balances from our issuance of senior notes totaling 1500 million in march 2018 and phillips 66 partners’ issuance of senior notes totaling 650 million in october 2017 this increase was partially offset by higher interest income 

corporate overhead and other decreased 93 million in 2018  compared with 2017  primarily due to lower environmentalrelated expenses and higher equity earnings from our share of income tax benefits recorded by equity affiliates due to the enactment of the tax act in december 2017

capital resources and liquidity 

financial indicators 



to meet our short and longterm liquidity requirements we look to a variety of funding sources but rely primarily on cash generated from operating activities additionally phillips 66 partners has raised funds for its growth activities through debt and equity financings during 2019  we generated 48 billion in cash from operations in addition phillips 66 partners had net debt issuances of 05 billion and received 04 billion from its joint venture partners to partially fund the gray oak pipeline capital project we used available cash primarily for capital expenditures and investments of 39 billion  repurchases of our common stock of 17 billion  and dividend payments on our common stock of 16 billion  during 2019  cash and cash equivalents decreased 14 billion to 16 billion  

in addition to cash flows from operating activities we rely on our commercial paper and credit facility programs asset sales and our ability to issue debt securities to support our short and longterm liquidity requirements we believe current cash and cash equivalents and cash generated by operations together with access to external sources of funds as described below under “significant sources of capital” will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near and long term including our capital spending dividend payments defined benefit plan contributions debt repayments and share repurchases 

significant sources of capital 

operating activities 

during 2019  cash generated by operating activities was 4808 million  a 37 decrease compared with 2018  the decrease was mainly driven by lower realized refining margins and decreased distributions from our equity affiliates along with unfavorable working capital impacts partially offset by improved results from our transportation and ngl and other businesses 

during 2018  cash of 7573 million was provided by operating activities a 108 increase compared with 2017  the increase was primarily attributable to higher realized refining and marketing margins increased distributions from our equity affiliates and lower employee benefit plan contributions these increases were partially offset by unfavorable working capital impacts primarily driven by the effects of changes in commodity prices and the timing of payments and collections 

our short and longterm operating cash flows are highly dependent upon refining and marketing margins ngl prices and chemicals margins prices and margins in our industry are typically volatile and are driven by market conditions over which we have little or no control absent other mitigating factors as these prices and margins fluctuate we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows 

index to financial statements 

the level and quality of output from our refineries also impacts our cash flows factors such as operating efficiency maintenance turnarounds market conditions feedstock availability and weather conditions can affect output we actively manage the operations of our refineries and any variability in their operations typically has not been as significant to cash flows as that caused by margins and prices our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization was 94 in 2019 and 95 in both 2018 and 2017 

equity affiliate operating distributions 

our operating cash flows are also impacted by distribution decisions made by our equity affiliates including cpchem dcp midstream and wrb over the three years ended december 31 2019  we received aggregate distributions from our equity affiliates of 6097 million  including 280 million from dcp midstream 2187 million from cpchem and 1380 million from wrb we cannot control the amount or timing of future dividends from equity affiliates therefore future dividend payments by these and other equity affiliates are not assured 

phillips 66 partners 

in 2013 we formed phillips 66 partners a publicly traded mlp to own operate develop and acquire primarily feebased midstream assets 

ownership and restructuring transaction

transfers of equity interests 

in december 2018 a third party exercised an option to acquire a 35 interest in gray oak holdings llc holdings llc a consolidated subsidiary of phillips 66 partners this transfer did not qualify as a sale under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap because of certain restrictions placed on the acquirer the contributions received by holdings llc from the third party to cover capital calls from gray oak pipeline llc are presented as a longterm obligation on our consolidated balance sheet and as financing cash inflows on our consolidated statement of cash flows until construction of the gray oak pipeline is fully completed and these restrictions expire during 2019  the third party contributed an aggregate of 342 million into holdings llc and holdings llc used these contributions to fund its portion of gray oak pipeline llc’s cash calls

contingencies 

a number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims that arose in the ordinary course of business have been filed against us or are subject to indemnifications provided by us we also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement storage disposal or release of certain chemical mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites we regularly assess the need for financial recognition or disclosure of these contingencies in the case of all known contingencies other than those related to income taxes we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable if a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount then the minimum of the range is accrued we do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or thirdparty recoveries if applicable we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other thirdparty recoveries in the case of income taxrelated contingencies we use a cumulative probabilityweighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain 

based on currently available information we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements as we learn new facts concerning contingencies we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include contingent liabilities recorded for environmental remediation tax and legal matters estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other potentially responsible parties estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes 

index to financial statements 

legal and tax matters 

our legal and tax matters are handled by our legal and tax organizations these organizations apply their knowledge experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases and uncertain tax positions we employ a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases and enables the tracking of those cases that have been scheduled for trial andor mediation based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals or establishment of new accruals is required in the case of income taxrelated contingencies we monitor tax legislation and court decisions the status of tax audits and the statute of limitations within which a taxing authority can assert a liability see note 21—income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about income taxrelated contingencies 

environmental 

we are subject to international federal state and local environmental laws and regulations among the most significant of these international and federal environmental laws and regulations are the 

  

 

these laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and in the case of discharges to water establish water quality limits they also in most cases require permits in association with new or modified operations these permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process which can be expensive and time consuming in addition there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency’s processing of the application many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant 

many states and foreign countries where we operate also have or are developing similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities while similar in some cases these regulations may impose additional or more stringent requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of developing infrastructure and marketing and transporting products across state and international borders for example in california the south coast air quality management district scaqmd approved amendments to the regional clean air incentives market reclaim that became effective in 2016 which require a phased reduction of nitrogen oxide emissions through 2022 affecting refineries in the los angeles metropolitan area in 2017 scaqmd required additional nitrogen dioxide emissions reductions through 2025 and is now promulgating new regulations to replace the reclaim program with a traditional command and control regulatory regime 

index to financial statements 

the ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards such as air emission standards water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations continue to evolve however environmental laws and regulations including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the united states and in other countries in which we operate notable areas of potential impacts include air emissions compliance and remediation obligations in the united states 

an example of this in the fuels area is the energy independence and security act of 2007 eisa it requires fuel producers and importers to provide additional renewable fuels for transportation motor fuels and stipulates a mix of various types rins form the mechanism used by the epa to record compliance with the renewable fuel standard if an obligated party has more rins than it needs to meet its obligation it may sell or trade the extra rins or instead choose to “bank” them for use the following year we have met the stringent requirements to date while establishing implementation operating and capital strategies along with advanced technology development to address projected future requirements it is uncertain how various future requirements contained in eisa and the regulations promulgated thereunder may be implemented and what their full impact may be on our operations for the 2020 compliance year the epa has set volumes of advanced and total renewable fuel at higher levels than in previous years it is uncertain if these increased obligations will be achievable by fuel producers and shippers without drawing on the rin bank additionally we may experience a decrease in demand for refined petroleum products due to the regulatory program as currently promulgated this program continues to be the subject of possible congressional review and repromulgation in revised form and the epa’s regulations pertaining to the 2014 through 2019 compliance years are subject to legal challenge further creating uncertainty regarding renewable fuel volume requirements and obligations compliance with the regulation has been further complicated as the market for rins has been the subject of fraudulent thirdparty activity and it is possible that some rins that we have purchased may be determined to be invalid should that occur we could incur costs to replace those fraudulent rins although the cost for replacing any fraudulently marketed rins is not reasonably estimable at this time we would not expect to incur the full financial impact of fraudulent rins replacement costs in any single interim or annual period and would not expect such costs to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

we also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations such laws and regulations include cercla and rcra and their state equivalents remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility arising from petroleum releases from underground storage tanks located at numerous previously and currently owned andor operated petroleummarketing outlets throughout the united states federal and state laws require contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards in addition to other cleanup standards many states have adopted cleanup criteria for methyl tertiarybutyl ether for both soil and groundwater 

at rcrapermitted facilities we are required to assess environmental conditions if conditions warrant we may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations in contrast to cercla which is often referred to as “superfund” the cost of corrective action activities under rcra corrective action programs typically is borne solely by us we anticipate increased expenditures for rcra remediation activities may be required but such annual expenditures for the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures we have experienced over the past few years longerterm expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly 

we occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the epa and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under cercla or an equivalent state statute on occasion we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties these requests notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations as of december 31 2018 we reported that we had been notified of potential liability under cercla and comparable state laws at 27 sites within the united states during 2019 there were no new sites for which we received notice of potential liability nor were any existing sites deemed resolved and closed leaving 27 unresolved sites with potential liability at december 31 2019 

index to financial statements 

for the majority of superfund sites our potential liability will be less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties is relatively low although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations and where they have not or where potentially responsible parties could not be located our share of liability has not increased materially many of the sites for which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the epa or the state agencies concerned prior to actual cleanup those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation in some instances we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain the epa or equivalent state agency approval of a remediation plan there are relatively few sites where we are a major participant and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all cercla sites in the aggregate is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition 

expensed environmental costs were 691 million in 2019 and are expected to be approximately 765 million and 760 million in 2020 and 2021  respectively capitalized environmental costs were 133 million in 2019 and are expected to be approximately 155 million and 180 million  in 2020 and 2021  respectively this amount does not include capital expenditures made for another purpose that have an indirect benefit on environmental compliance 

accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted except those assumed in a business combination which we record on a discounted basis 

many of these liabilities result from cercla rcra and similar state laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct or once conducted operations or at sites where our generated waste was disposed we also have accrued for a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation but which are not currently the subject of cercla rcra or state enforcement activities if applicable we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other thirdparty recoveries in the future we may incur significant costs under both cercla and rcra remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site depending on the mix of unique site characteristics evolving remediation technologies diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties therefore it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs 

notwithstanding any of the foregoing and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in certain of our operations and products and there can be no assurance that those costs and liabilities will not be material however we currently do not expect any material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations 

climate change 

there has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state national and international laws focusing on ghg emissions reduction including various regulations proposed or issued by the epa these proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in states andor countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future laws regulating ghg emissions continue to evolve and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation such laws potentially could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition as a result of increasing costs of compliance lengthening project implementation and agency reviews or reducing demand for certain hydrocarbon products examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include

in the eu the first phase of the eu ets completed at the end of 2007 and phase ii was undertaken from 2008 through 2012 the current phase phase iii runs from 2013 through to 2020 with the main changes being reduced allocation of free allowances and increased auctioning of new allowances phillips 66 has assets that are subject to the eu ets and the company is actively engaged in minimizing any financial impact from the eu ets 

from november 30 to december 12 2015 more than 190 countries including the united states participated in the united nations climate change conference in paris france the conference culminated in what is known as the “paris agreement” which upon certain conditions being met entered into force on november 4 2016 the paris agreement establishes a commitment by signatory parties to pursue domestic ghg emission reductions in 2017 the president of the united states announced his intention to withdraw the united states from the paris agreement on november 4 2019 the united states submitted formal notification of its withdrawal to the united nations triggering a oneyear waiting period to final withdrawal 

in the united states some additional form of regulation is likely to be forthcoming in the future at the state or federal levels with respect to ghg emissions such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in additional financial burden in the form of taxes the restriction of output investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances 

compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a ghg emission trading program ghg reduction requirements or carbon taxes could significantly increase our costs reduce demand for fossil energy derived products impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources 

an example of one such program is california’s cap and trade program which was promulgated pursuant to the state’s global warming solutions act the program had been limited to certain stationary sources which include our refineries in california but beginning in january 2015 was expanded to include emissions from transportation fuels distributed in california inclusion of transportation fuels in california’s cap and trade program as currently promulgated has increased our cap and trade program compliance costs the ultimate impact on our financial performance either positive or negative from this and similar programs will depend on a number of factors including but not limited to

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses see note 1—summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for descriptions of our major accounting policies some of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions or if different assumptions had been used the following discussion of critical accounting estimates along with the discussion of contingencies in this report address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions could be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change 

impairments 

longlived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future expected cash flows if the sum of the undiscounted expected future pretax cash flows of an asset group is less than the carrying value including applicable liabilities the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets for example at a refinery complex level because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for longlived assets the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined using one or more of the following methods the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants a market multiple for similar assets or historical market transactions including similar assets adjusted using principal market participant assumptions when necessary the expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments including future volumes commodity prices operating costs margins discount rates and capital project decisions considering all available information at the date of review 

investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are assessed for impairment when there are indicators of a loss in value such as a lack of sustained earnings capacity or a current fair value less than the investment’s carrying amount when it is determined that an indicated impairment is other than temporary a charge is recognized for the difference between the investment’s carrying value and its estimated fair value 

when determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary management considers factors such as the duration and extent of the decline the investee’s financial condition and nearterm prospects and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that allows for recovery when quoted market prices are not available the fair value is usually based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants and observed market earnings multiples of comparable companies if appropriate different assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period 

asset retirement obligations 

under various contracts permits and regulations we have legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land at the end of operations at certain operational sites our largest asset removal obligations involve asbestos abatement at refineries estimating the timing and cost of future asset removals is difficult most of these removal obligations are many years or decades in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs asset removal technologies and costs regulatory and other compliance considerations expenditure timing and other inputs into valuation of the obligation including discount and inflation rates are also subject to change 

environmental costs 

in addition to asset retirement obligations discussed above we have certain obligations to complete environmentalrelated projects these projects are primarily related to cleanup at domestic refineries underground storage sites and nonoperated sites future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs timing and extent of such remedial actions that may be required and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties

intangible assets and goodwill 

at december 31 2019  we had 752 million of intangible assets that we have determined to have indefinite useful lives and therefore do not amortize the judgmental determination that an intangible asset has an indefinite useful life is continuously evaluated if due to changes in facts and circumstances management determines these intangible assets have finite useful lives amortization will commence at that time on a prospective basis as long as these intangible assets are determined to have indefinite lives they will be subject to at least annual impairment tests that require management’s judgment of their estimated fair value 

at december 31 2019  we had 33 billion of goodwill recorded in conjunction with past business combinations goodwill is not amortized instead goodwill is subject to at least annual tests for impairment at a reporting unit level a reporting unit is an operating segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment and they are determined primarily based on the manner in which the business is managed 

  

we perform our annual goodwill impairment test using a qualitative assessment and a quantitative assessment if one is deemed necessary as part of our qualitative assessment we evaluate relevant events and circumstances that could affect the fair value of our reporting units including macroeconomic conditions overall industry and market considerations and regulatory changes as well as companyspecific market metrics performance and events the evaluation of companyspecific events and circumstances includes evaluating changes in our stock price and cost of capital actual and forecasted financial performance as well as the effect of significant asset dispositions if our qualitative assessment indicates it is likely the fair value of a reporting unit has declined below its carrying value including goodwill a quantitative assessment is performed 

when a quantitative assessment is performed management applies judgment in determining the estimated fair values of the reporting units because quoted market prices for our reporting units are not available management uses available information to make this fair value determination including estimated future cash flows cost of capital observed market earnings multiples of comparable companies our common stock price and associated total company market capitalization 

we completed our annual qualitative assessment of goodwill as of october 1 2019  and concluded that the fair values of our reporting units continued to exceed their respective carrying values including goodwill by significant percentages a decline in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units in the future could result in an impairment as such we continue to monitor for indicators of impairment until our next annual impairment test is performed 

tax assets and liabilities 

our operations are subject to various taxes including federal state and foreign income taxes property taxes and transactional taxes such as excise salesuse valueadded and payroll taxes we record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations the recording of tax liabilities requires significant judgment and estimates we recognize the financial statement effects of an income tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority a contingent liability related to a transactional tax claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and reasonably estimable actual incurred tax liabilities can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons including different interpretations of tax laws and regulations and different assessments of the amount of tax due 

in determining our income tax expense benefit we assess the likelihood our deferred tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income valuation allowances reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized judgment is required in estimating the amount of valuation allowance if any that should be recorded against our deferred tax assets based on our historical taxable income our expectations for the future and available taxplanning strategies we expect the net deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as reductions to future taxable income if our actual results of operations differ from such estimates or our estimates of future taxable income change the valuation allowance may need to be revised 

new tax laws and regulations as well as changes to existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being proposed or promulgated the implementation of future legislative and regulatory tax initiatives could result in increased income tax liabilities that cannot be predicted at this time

projected benefit obligations 

calculation of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans impacts the obligations on the balance sheet and the amount of benefit expense in the income statement the actuarial calculation of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events including estimated retirement dates salary levels at retirement mortality rates lumpsum election rates rates of return on plan assets future interest rates future health care costtrend rates and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the calculation of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements due to the specialized nature of these calculations as financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies have different objectives and requirements the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects ultimately we will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions a one percentagepoint decrease in the discount rate assumption used for the plan obligation would increase annual benefit expense by an estimated 55 million while a one percentagepoint decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by an estimated 35 million in determining the discount rate we use yields on highquality fixed income investments with payments matched to the estimated distributions of benefits from our plans 

the expected weightedaverage longterm rate of return for worldwide pension plan assets was approximately 6 for both 2019 and 2018  while the actual weightedaverage rate of return was 18 in 2019 and negative 4 in 2018  for the past ten years our actual weightedaverage rate of return for worldwide pension plan assets was 9

refining

the gaap performance measure most directly comparable to realized refining margin per barrel is the refining segment’s “income loss before income taxes per barrel” realized refining margin per barrel excludes items that are typically included in a manufacturer’s gross margin such as depreciation and operating expenses and other items used to determine income loss before income taxes such as general and administrative expenses it also includes our proportional share of joint venture refineries’ realized refining margins and excludes special items because realized refining margin per barrel is calculated in this manner and because realized refining margin per barrel may be defined differently by other companies in our industry it has limitations as an analytical tool following are reconciliations of income loss before income taxes to realized refining margins

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial instrument market risk 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are exposed to market risks produced by changes in the prices of crude oil refined petroleum products natural gas ngl and electric power as well as fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we and certain of our subsidiaries may hold and use derivative contracts to manage these risks 

commodity price risk 

generally our policy is to remain exposed to the market prices of commodities consistent with this policy we use derivative contracts to convert our exposure from fixedprice sales or purchase contracts often specified in contracts with refined petroleum product customers back to floating market prices we also use futures forwards swaps and options in various markets to accomplish the following objectives 

 

 

 

these objectives optimize the value of our supply chain and may reduce our exposure to fluctuations in market prices 

our use of derivative instruments is governed by an “authority limitations” document approved by our board of directors which prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient market liquidity for comparable valuations and establishes value at risk var limits compliance with these limits is monitored daily by our global risk group 

we use a var model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative commodity instruments held or issued using monte carlo simulation a 95 confidence level and a oneday holding period the var for derivative commodity instruments issued or held at december 31 2019 and 2018  was immaterial to our cash flows and net income

our revenues operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent on a number of factors including fixed and variable expenses including the cost of crude oil ngl and other refining and petrochemical feedstocks and the margin we can derive from selling refined petroleum petrochemical and plastics products the prices of feedstocks and our products fluctuate substantially these prices depend on numerous factors beyond our control including the global supply and demand for feedstocks and our products which are subject to among other things 

  

 

the price of crude oil influences prices for refined petroleum products we do not produce crude oil and must purchase all of the crude oil we process many crude oils available on the world market will not meet the quality restrictions for use in our refineries others are not economical to use due to high transportation costs or for other reasons the prices for crude oil and refined petroleum products can fluctuate differently based on global regional and local market conditions as well as by type and class of products which can reduce refining margins and could have a significant impact on our refining wholesale marketing and retail operations revenues operating income and cash flows also crude oil supply contracts generally have marketresponsive pricing provisions we normally purchase our refinery feedstocks weeks before manufacturing and selling the refined petroleum products changes in prices that occur between when we purchase feedstocks and when we sell the refined petroleum products produced from these feedstocks could have a significant effect on our financial results we also purchase refined petroleum products produced by others for sale to our customers price changes that occur between when we purchase and sell these refined petroleum products also could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the price of feedstocks also influences prices for petrochemical and plastics products although our chemicals segment transports and fractionates feedstocks to meet a portion of their demand and has certain longterm feedstock supply contracts with others it is still subject to volatile feedstock prices in addition the petrochemicals industry is both cyclical and volatile cyclicality occurs when periods of tight supply resulting in increased prices and profit margins are followed by periods of capacity expansion resulting in oversupply and declining prices and profit margins volatility occurs as a result of changes in supply and demand for products changes in energy prices and changes in various other economic conditions around the world 

uncertainty and illiquidity in credit and capital markets can impair our ability to obtain credit and financing on acceptable terms and can adversely affect the financial strength of our business partners 

our ability to obtain credit and capital depends in large measure on the state of the credit and capital markets which is beyond our control our ability to access credit and capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like or need access to those markets which could constrain our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions in addition the cost and availability of debt and equity financing may be adversely impacted by unstable or illiquid market conditions protracted uncertainty and illiquidity in these markets also could have an adverse impact on our lenders commodity hedging counterparties or our customers preventing them from meeting their obligations to us 

index to financial statements 

from time to time our cash needs may exceed our internally generated cash flow and our business could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to obtain necessary funds from financing activities from time to time we may need to supplement cash generated from operations with proceeds from financing activities uncertainty and illiquidity in financial markets may materially impact the ability of the participating financial institutions to fund their commitments to us under our liquidity facilities accordingly we may not be able to obtain the full amount of the funds available under our liquidity facilities to satisfy our cash requirements and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position 

deterioration in our credit profile could increase our costs of borrowing money and limit our access to the capital markets and commercial credit and could trigger coventurer rights under joint venture arrangements 

our or phillips 66 partners’ credit ratings could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment the circumstances warrant if a rating agency were to downgrade our rating below investment grade our or phillips 66 partners’ borrowing costs would increase and our funding sources could decrease in addition a failure by us to maintain an investment grade rating could affect our business relationships with suppliers and operating partners for example our agreement with chevron regarding cpchem permits chevron to buy our 50 percent interest in cpchem for fair market value if we experience a change in control or if both standard  poor’s financial services llc and moody’s investors service inc lower our credit ratings below investment grade and the credit rating from either rating agency remains below investment grade for 365 days thereafter with fair market value determined by agreement or by nationally recognized investment banks as a result of these factors a downgrade of credit ratings could have a materially adverse impact on our future operations and financial position 

we expect to continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of our compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations likewise future environmental laws and regulations may impact or limit our current business plans and reduce demand for our products 

our business is subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment these laws and regulations continue to increase in both number and complexity and affect our operations with respect to among other things 

  

 

we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital operating and maintenance and remediation expenditures as a result of these laws and regulations to the extent these expenditures as with all costs are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in future periods could be materially adversely affected 

the us environmental protection agency epa has implemented a renewable fuel standard rfs pursuant to the energy policy act of 2005 and the energy independence and security act of 2007 the rfs program sets annual quotas for the quantity of renewable fuels such as ethanol that must be blended into motor fuels consumed in the united states to provide certain flexibility in compliance options available to the industry a renewable identification number rin is assigned to each gallon of renewable fuel produced in or imported into the united states as a producer of petroleumbased motor fuels we are obligated to blend renewable fuels into the products we produce at a rate that is at least commensurate to the epa’s quota and to the extent we do not we must purchase rins in the open market to satisfy our obligation under the rfs program to the extent the epa mandates a blending quantity of renewable fuel that exceeds the amount that is commercially feasible to blend into motor fuel a situation commonly referred to as “the blend wall” our operations could be materially adversely impacted up to and including a reduction in produced motor fuel

the adoption of climate change legislation or regulation could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the refined petroleum products we produce 

the us government including the epa as well as several state and international governments have either considered or adopted legislation or regulations in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas ghg emissions these proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in states andor countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future in addition various groups suggest that additional laws may be needed in an effort to address climate change as illustrated by the paris agreement negotiated at the 2015 united nations conference on climate change referred to as cop 21 which entered into force on november 4 2016 we cannot predict the extent to which any such legislation or regulation will be enacted and if so what its provisions would be to the extent we incur additional costs required to comply with the adoption of new laws and regulations that are not ultimately recovered in the prices of our products and services our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in future periods could be materially adversely affected in addition demand for the refined petroleum products we produce could be adversely affected 

climate change may adversely affect our facilities and our ongoing operations 

the potential physical effects of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and depend upon the unique geographic and environmental factors present examples of such effects include rising sea levels at our coastal facilities changing storm patterns and intensities and changing temperature levels as many of our facilities are located near coastal areas rising sea levels may disrupt our ability to operate those facilities or transport crude oil and refined petroleum products extended periods of such disruption could have an adverse effect on our results of operation we could also incur substantial costs to prevent or repair damage to these facilities 

political and economic developments could affect our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows 

actions of federal state local and international governments through legislation or regulation executive order permit or other review of infrastructure or facility development and commercial restrictions could delay projects increase costs limit development or otherwise reduce our operating profitability both in the united states and abroad any such actions may affect many aspects of our operations including 

 

in addition the us government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries and from doing business with entities affiliated with foreign governments which can include state oil companies and us subsidiaries of those companies the office of foreign assets control ofac of the us department of the treasury administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on us foreign policy and national security matters for example sanctions are currently in effect against venezuela and certain entities affiliated with it the effect of any such ofac sanctions could disrupt transactions with or operations involving entities affiliated with sanctioned countries and could limit our ability to obtain optimum crude slates and other refinery feedstocks and effectively distribute refined petroleum products 

other risks inherent in doing business internationally include global financial market turmoil economic volatility and global economic slowdown currency exchange rate fluctuations and inflationary pressures import or export restrictions and changes in trade regulations acts of terrorism war civil unrest and other political risks difficulties in developing staffing and managing foreign operations and potentially adverse tax developments if any of these events occur our businesses and those of our joint ventures may be adversely affected 

additionally renewable fuels alternative energy mandates and energy conservation efforts could reduce demand for refined petroleum products tax incentives and other subsidies can make renewable fuels and alternative energy more competitive with refined petroleum products than they otherwise might be which may reduce refined petroleum product margins and hinder the ability of refined petroleum products to compete with renewable fuels

large capital projects can take many years to complete and market conditions could deteriorate significantly between the project approval date and the project startup date negatively impacting expected project returns 

our basis for approving a largescale capital project is the expectation that it will deliver an acceptable level of return on the capital invested we base these forecasted project economics on our best estimate of future market conditions most largescale projects take several years to complete during this multiyear period market conditions can change from those we forecast and these changes could be significant accordingly we may not be able to realize our expected returns from a large investment in a capital project and this could negatively impact our results of operations cash flows and our return on capital employed 

plans we may have to expand existing assets or construct new assets particularly in our midstream segment are subject to risks associated with societal and political pressures and other forms of opposition to the future development transportation and use of carbonbased fuels such risks could adversely impact our ability to realize certain growth strategies 

certain of our planned expenditures are based upon the assumption that societal sentiment will continue to enable and existing regulations will remain intact to allow for the future development transportation and use of carbonbased fuels a portion of our growth strategy is dependent on our ability to expand existing assets and to construct additional assets policy decisions relating to the production refining transportation and marketing of carbonbased fuels are subject to political pressures and the influence and protests of environmental and other special interest groups for example our midstream segment’s growth plans include the construction or expansion of pipelines which can involve numerous regulatory environmental political and legal uncertainties many of which are beyond our control our growth projects may not be completed on schedule or at the budgeted cost in addition our revenues may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs could negatively impact our results of operations cash flows and our return on capital employed 

our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses failure to manage risks associated with business interruptions could adversely impact our operations financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our operations are subject to business interruptions due to scheduled refinery turnarounds unplanned maintenance or unplanned events such as explosions fires refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents power outages severe weather labor disputes or other natural or manmade disasters such as acts of terrorism including cyberintrusion the inability to operate one or more of our facilities due to any of these events could significantly impair our ability to manufacture our products additionally our manufacturing equipment is becoming increasingly dependent on our information technology systems a disruption in our information technology systems due to a catastrophic event or security breach could interrupt or damage our operations 

explosions fires refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents involving our assets or operations could result in serious personal injury or loss of human life significant damage to property and equipment environmental pollution impairment of operations and substantial losses to us for assets located near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers industrial sites and other public gathering areas the level of damage resulting from these risks could be greater damages resulting from an incident involving any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially substantial claims or in our being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities should any of these risks materialize at any of our equity affiliates it could have a material adverse effect on the business and financial condition of the equity affiliate and negatively impact their ability to make future distributions to us 

index to financial statements 

there are certain hazards and risks inherent in our operations that could adversely affect those operations and our financial results 

the operation of refineries power plants fractionators pipelines terminals and vessels is inherently subject to the risks of spills discharges or other inadvertent releases of petroleum or hazardous substances if any of these events had previously occurred or occurs in the future in connection with any of our refineries pipelines or refined petroleum products terminals or in connection with any facilities that receive our wastes or byproducts for treatment or disposal other than events for which we are indemnified we could be liable for all costs and penalties associated with their remediation under federal state local and international environmental laws or common law and could be liable for property damage to third parties caused by contamination from releases and spills 

we do not insure against all potential losses and therefore our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by unexpected liabilities and increased costs 

we maintain insurance coverage in amounts we believe to be prudent against many but not all potential liabilities arising from operating hazards uninsured liabilities arising from operating hazards including but not limited to explosions fires refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents involving our assets or operations could reduce the funds available to us for capital and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our investments in joint ventures decrease our ability to manage risk 

we conduct some of our operations including parts of our midstream refining and ms segments and our entire chemicals segment through joint ventures in which we share control with our joint venture participants our joint venture participants may have economic business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours or those of the joint venture or our joint venture participants may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone failure by us or an entity in which we have a joint venture interest to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisitions or joint ventures could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our joint ventures and in turn our business and operations 

we are subject to interruptions of supply and increased costs as a result of our reliance on thirdparty transportation of crude oil ngl and refined petroleum products 

we often utilize the services of third parties to transport crude oil ngl and refined petroleum products to and from our facilities in addition to our own operational risks discussed above we could experience interruptions of supply or increases in costs to deliver refined petroleum products to market if the ability of the pipelines or vessels to transport crude oil or refined petroleum products is disrupted because of weather events accidents governmental regulations or thirdparty actions a prolonged disruption of the ability of a pipeline or vessel to transport crude oil ngl or refined petroleum products to or from one or more of our refineries or other facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in us production of crude oil and natural gas which could adversely impact our results of operations 

an increasing percentage of crude oil supplied to our refineries and the crude oil and gas production of our midstream segment’s customers is being produced from unconventional oil shale reservoirs these reservoirs require hydraulic fracturing completion processes to release the hydrocarbons from the rock so they can flow through casing to the surface hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water sand and chemicals under pressure into a formation to stimulate hydrocarbon production the epa as well as several state agencies have commenced studies andor convened hearings regarding the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities at the same time certain environmental groups have suggested that additional laws may be needed to more closely and uniformly regulate the hydraulic fracturing process and legislation has been proposed to provide for such regulation in addition some communities have adopted measures to ban hydraulic fracturing in their communities we cannot predict whether any such legislation will ever be enacted and if so what its provisions would be any additional levels of regulation and permits required with the adoption of new laws and regulations at the federal or state level could result in our having to rely on higher priced crude oil for our refineries this could lead to delays increased operating costs and process prohibitions that could reduce 

index to financial statements 

the volumes of natural gas that move through dcp midstream’s gathering systems and could reduce supplies and increase costs of ngl feedstocks to cpchem’s facilities this could materially adversely affect our results of operations and the ability of dcp midstream and cpchem to make cash distributions to us 

dcp midstream’s success depends on its ability to obtain new sources of natural gas and ngl any decrease in the volumes of natural gas dcp midstream gathers could adversely affect its business and operating results 

dcp midstream’s gathering and transportation pipeline systems are connected to or dependent on the level of production from natural gas wells which naturally declines over time as a result its cash flows associated with these wells will also decline over time in order to maintain or increase throughput levels on its gathering and transportation pipeline systems and ngl pipelines and the asset utilization rates at its natural gas processing plants dcp midstream must continually obtain new supplies the primary factors affecting dcp midstream’s ability to obtain new supplies of natural gas and ngl and to attract new customers to its assets include the level of successful drilling activity near these assets prices of and the demand for natural gas and crude oil producers’ desire and ability to obtain necessary permits in an efficient manner natural gas field characteristics and production performance surface access and infrastructure issues and its ability to compete for volumes from successful new wells if dcp midstream is not able to obtain new supplies of natural gas to replace the natural decline in volumes from existing wells or because of competition throughput on its pipelines and the utilization rates of its treating and processing facilities would decline this could have a material adverse effect on its business results of operations financial position and cash flows and its ability to make cash distributions to us 

competitors that produce their own supply of feedstocks have more extensive retail outlets or have greater financial resources may have a competitive advantage 

the refining and marketing industry is highly competitive with respect to both feedstock supply and refined petroleum product markets we compete with many companies for available supplies of crude oil and other feedstocks and for outlets for our refined petroleum products we do not produce any of our crude oil feedstocks some of our competitors however obtain a portion of their feedstocks from their own production and some have more extensive retail outlets than we have competitors that have their own production or extensive retail outlets and greater brandname recognition are at times able to offset losses from refining operations with profits from producing or retailing operations and may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages 

some of our competitors also have materially greater financial and other resources than we have such competitors have a greater ability to bear the economic risks inherent in all phases of our business in addition we compete with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel requirements of our industrial commercial and individual customers 

we may incur losses as a result of our forward contracts and derivative transactions 

we currently use commodity derivative instruments and we expect to use them in the future if the instruments we utilize to hedge our exposure to various types of risk are not effective we may incur losses derivative transactions involve the risk that counterparties may be unable to satisfy their obligations to us the risk of counterparty default is heightened in a poor economic environment 

one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of a publicly traded master limited partnership phillips 66 partners which may involve a greater exposure to legal liability than our historic business operations 

one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of phillips 66 partners a publicly traded master limited partnership our control of the general partner of phillips 66 partners may increase the possibility that we could be subject to claims of breach of fiduciary duties including claims of conflicts of interest related to phillips 66 partners any liability resulting from such claims could have a material adverse effect on our future business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability which would cause our business and reputation to suffer 

in the ordinary course of our business we collect sensitive data including personally identifiable information of our customers and employees despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure   or information technology and infrastructure of our thirdparty service providers eg cloudbased service providers may be vulnerable to attacks by malicious actors or breached due to human error malfeasance or other disruptions although we have experienced occasional actual or attempted breaches of our cybersecurity none of these breaches has had a material effect on our business operations or reputation or compromised any customer data any such breaches could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability under laws that protect the privacy of customer information including the european union’s general data protection regulation disrupt the services we provide to customers and damage our reputation any of which could adversely affect our business 

the level of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the expected return on plan assets for our pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans are evaluated by us based on a variety of independent sources of market information and in consultation with outside actuaries if we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected longterm rate of return or health care cost trend rate our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses and funding requirements could increase in addition several factors could cause actual results to differ significantly from the actuarial assumptions that we use funding obligations are determined based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date as required under relevant regulations future pension funding requirements and the timing of funding payments could be affected by legislation enacted by governmental authorities 

in connection with the separation conocophillips has indemnified us for certain liabilities and we have agreed to indemnify conocophillips for certain liabilities if we are required to act on these indemnities to conocophillips we may need to use cash to meet those obligations and our financial results could be negatively impacted the conocophillips indemnity may not be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of liabilities for which it has been allocated responsibility and conocophillips may not be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future 

pursuant to the indemnification and release agreement and certain other agreements with conocophillips entered into in connection with the separation conocophillips agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities and we agreed to indemnify conocophillips for certain liabilities indemnities that we may be required to provide conocophillips are not subject to any cap may be significant and could negatively impact our business particularly indemnities relating to our actions that could impact the taxfree nature of the distribution of phillips 66 stock third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that conocophillips has agreed to retain further the indemnity from conocophillips may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities and conocophillips may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations moreover even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from conocophillips any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves each of these risks could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to continuing contingent liabilities of conocophillips following the separation 

notwithstanding the separation there are several significant areas where the liabilities of conocophillips may become our obligations for example under the internal revenue code and the related rules and regulations each corporation that was a member of the conocophillips consolidated us federal income tax reporting group during any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the effective time of the separation is jointly and severally liable for the us federal income tax liability of the entire conocophillips consolidated tax reporting group for that taxable period in connection with the separation we entered into the tax sharing agreement with conocophillips that allocates the responsibility for prior period taxes of the conocophillips consolidated tax reporting group between us and conocophillips conocophillips may be unable to pay any prior period taxes for which it is responsible and we could be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes other provisions of federal law establish similar liability for other matters including laws governing taxqualified pension plans as well as other contingent liabilities 

index to financial statements 

if the distribution in connection with the separation together with certain related transactions does not qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes our stockholders and conocophillips could be subject to significant tax liability and in certain circumstances we could be required to indemnify conocophillips for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax sharing agreement 

conocophillips received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service irs substantially to the effect that among other things the distribution together with certain related transactions qualified as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the internal revenue code the private letter ruling and the tax opinion that conocophillips received relied on certain representations assumptions and undertakings including those relating to the past and future conduct of our business and neither the private letter ruling nor the opinion would be valid if such representations assumptions and undertakings were incorrect moreover the private letter ruling does not address all the issues that are relevant to determining whether the distribution qualified for taxfree treatment notwithstanding the private letter ruling and the tax opinion the irs could determine the distribution should be treated as a taxable transaction for us federal income tax purposes if it determines any of the representations assumptions or undertakings that were included in the request for the private letter ruling are false or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion that are not covered by the irs ruling 

if the irs were to determine that the distribution failed to qualify for taxfree treatment in general conocophillips would be subject to tax as if it had sold the phillips 66 common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value and conocophillips stockholders who received shares of phillips 66 common stock in the distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares 

under the tax sharing agreement we would generally be required to indemnify conocophillips against any tax resulting from the distribution to the extent that such tax resulted from i any of our representations or undertakings being incorrect or violated or ii other actions or failures to act by us our indemnification obligations to conocophillips and its subsidiaries officers and directors are not limited by any maximum amount if we are required to indemnify conocophillips or such other persons under the circumstances set forth in the tax sharing agreement we may be subject to substantial liabilities

the following is a description of reportable legal proceedings including those involving governmental authorities under federal state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment while it is not possible to accurately predict the final outcome of these pending proceedings if any one or more of such proceedings were decided adversely to phillips 66 we expect there would be no material effect on our consolidated financial position nevertheless such proceedings are reported pursuant to securities and exchange commission sec regulations 

our us refineries are implementing two separate consent decrees regarding alleged violations of the federal clean air act with the us environmental protection agency epa five states and one local air pollution agency some of the requirements and limitations contained in the decrees provide for stipulated penalties for violations stipulated penalties under the decrees are not automatic but must be requested by one of the agency signatories as part of periodic reports under the decrees or other reports required by permits or regulations we occasionally report matters that could be subject to a request for stipulated penalties if a specific request for stipulated penalties meeting the reporting threshold set forth in sec rules is made pursuant to these decrees based on a given reported exceedance we will separately report that matter and the amount of the proposed penalty 

new matters 

in november 2018 the california air resources board carb demanded penalties to resolve a notice of violation nov alleging that initial fuel certifications submitted by the company in november and december 2016 with respect to eight batches of gasoline were noncompliant with carb regulations we agreed to resolve the nov with a penalty payment of 150000 

in late 2018 phillips 66 and the epa agreed to resolve certain flaring violations alleged to have occurred at our billings refinery between may 2010 and september 2018 epas proposed resolution includes payments of a 150000 penalty and approximately 220000 for supplemental environmental projects we are working with the epa to finalize settlement terms to resolve this matter

business environment 

the price of us benchmark crude oil west texas intermediate wti at cushing oklahoma increased to an average of 6492 per barrel during 2018 compared with an average of 5090 per barrel in 2017 the wti discount versus the international benchmark dated brent widened in 2018  compared with 2017 due to growing us crude production a widening differential generally benefits our results over the course of 2018 commodity prices had both favorable and unfavorable impacts on our businesses that vary by segment 

the midstream segment which includes our 50 percent equity investment in dcp midstream contains feebased operations that are not directly exposed to commodity price risk as well as operations that are directly linked to natural gas liquids ngl prices natural gas prices and crude oil prices natural gas prices were relatively flat in 2018 compared with 2017 while ngl prices were higher in 2018 due to higher global crude oil prices and increased domestic demand for ethane 

  

the chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in cpchem the chemicals and plastics industry is mainly a commoditybased industry where the margins for key products are based on supply and demand as well as cost factors during 2018 the highdensity polyethylene chain margin contracted mainly due to rapidly expanding north american supply in addition lower napthabased feedstock costs internationally narrowed the difference between napthabased and ethanebased margins however north american ethanebased crackers integrated through ethylene derivatives continue to benefit from a feedstock price advantage associated with abundant domestic supply and continue to capture a higher polyethylene chain margin than crackers in most other regions of the world 

our refining segment results are driven by several factors including refining margins cost control refinery throughput feedstock costs product yields and turnaround activity industry crack spread indicators the difference between market prices for refined petroleum products and crude oil are used to estimate refining margins during 2018  the us 321 crack spread three barrels of crude oil producing two barrels of gasoline and one barrel of diesel decreased compared with 2017 primarily due to lower gasoline crack spreads caused by higher refinery utilization the average northwest europe crack spread increased slightly in 2018 compared with 2017 due to higher distillate prices 

results for our ms segment depend largely on marketing fuel margins lubricant margins and other specialty product margins while ms margins are primarily driven by market factors largely determined by the relationship between supply and demand marketing fuel margins in particular are influenced by the trend in spot prices for refined petroleum products generally speaking a downward trend of spot prices has a favorable impact on marketing fuel margins while an upward trend of spot prices has an unfavorable impact on marketing fuel margins

income statement analysis 

2018  vs 2017   

sales and other operating revenues  and purchased crude oil and products   increased   9 percent  and 23 percent  respectively in 2018  the increases were mainly due to higher prices for refined petroleum products crude oil and ngl the increase in sales and other operating revenues was partially offset by a change in the presentation of excise taxes on sales of refined petroleum products resulting from our adoption of financial accounting standard board fasb accounting standards update asu no 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers topic 606” on january 1 2018 as part of our adoption of this asu prospectively from january 1 2018 our presentation of excise taxes on sales of refined petroleum products changed to a net basis from a gross basis as a result the “sales and other operating revenues” and “taxes other than income taxes” lines on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december 31 2018  are not presented on a comparable basis to the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  see note 1—summary of significant accounting policies  and note 2—changes in accounting principles  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our presentation of excise taxes on sales of refined petroleum products and our adoption of this asu respectively 

equity in earnings of affiliates   increased   55 percent  in 2018  primarily resulting from higher equity in earnings from wrb cpchem and affiliates in our midstream segment 

 

other income   decreased   460 million  in 2018  we recognized a noncash pretax gain of 423 million  in february 2017 related to the consolidation of merey sweeny see note 5—business combinations  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

  

taxes other than income taxes   decreased   97 percent  in 2018  the decrease was primarily attributable to the change in our presentation of excise taxes on sales of refined petroleum products resulting from our adoption of asu no 201409 on january 1 2018 see the “sales and other operating revenues” section above for further discussion 

interest and debt expense   increased   15 percent  in 2018  the increase was due to higher average debt principal balances resulting from our issuance of senior notes totaling 1500 million in march 2018 and phillips 66 partners’ issuance of senior notes totaling 650 million in october 2017 

income tax expense benefit  was an expense in 2018 compared with a benefit in 2017 the benefit in 2017 was due to the recognition of a provisional income tax benefit of 2735 million from the enactment of the tax act in december 2017 the benefit from the tax act was primarily due to the revaluation of deferred income taxes excluding this benefit income tax expense increased in 2018 due to higher income before income taxes partially offset by the reduction of the us federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent beginning january 1 2018 as a result of the tax act see note 21—income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our income taxes 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests   increased   136 million  in 2018  primarily due to the contribution of assets to phillips 66 partners in the fourth quarter of 2017 see note 27—phillips 66 partners lp  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information

2017  vs 2016   

sales and other operating revenues  and purchased crude oil and products   increased   21 percent  and 27 percent  respectively in 2017  the increases were primarily due to higher prices for refined petroleum products crude oil and ngl 

equity in earnings of affiliates   increased   22 percent  in 2017  primarily resulting from higher equity in earnings from dcp midstream and other affiliates in our midstream segment as well as wrb partially offset by lower results from cpchem 

 

other income   increased   447 million  in 2017  we recognized a noncash pretax gain of 423 million  in february 2017 related to the consolidation of merey sweeny see note 5—business combinations  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

operating expenses   increased   10 percent  in 2017  this increase was mainly due to the consolidation of a transportation joint venture in december 2016 as well as higher refining turnaround expenses and utility costs pension settlement expense and costs associated with a full year of operations at the freeport lpg export terminal these increases were partially offset by lower costs due to the sale of the whitegate refinery in 2016 

depreciation and amortization   increased   13 percent  in 2017  due to the freeport lpg export terminal beginning operations in late 2016 as well as other assets placed in service in 2017 

interest and debt expense   increased   30 percent  in 2017  this increase was primarily driven by lower capitalized interest due to the completion of major projects including completion of the freeport lpg export terminal project in late 2016 as well as higher average debt principal balances 

income tax expense benefit  was a benefit in 2017  compared with expense in 2016 primarily due to the 2735 million provisional income tax benefit from the enactment of the tax act in december 2017 the benefit from the tax act was primarily due to the revaluation of deferred income taxes this benefit was partially offset by higher income tax expense from increased income before income taxes see note 21—income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our income taxes 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests   increased   53 million  in 2017  primarily due to the contributions of assets to phillips 66 partners during 2017 and late 2016 see note 27—phillips 66 partners lp  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information

the midstream segment provides crude oil and refined petroleum product transportation terminaling and processing services as well as natural gas and ngl transportation storage processing and marketing services mainly in the united states this segment includes our master limited partnership mlp phillips 66 partners as well as our 50 percent  equity investment in dcp midstream which includes the operations of its mlp dcp midstream lp dcp partners 

2018  vs 2017   

pretax income from the midstream segment increased   543 million  in 2018  compared with 2017  due to improved results across all business lines 

pretax income from our transportation business increased   240 million  in 2018  compared with 2017  the increase was mainly driven by higher volumes tariffs and storage rates from our portfolio of consolidated and joint venture assets these increases were partially offset by a decrease in equity earnings from rockies express pipeline llc rex due to a favorable settlement recorded in 2017 

pretax income from our ngl and other business increased   273 million  in 2018  compared with 2017  the increase was primarily due to the contribution of merey sweeny to phillips 66 partners in october 2017 inventory impacts improved cargo margins and volumes and higher equity earnings from pipeline affiliates due to increased volumes

pretax income from our investment in dcp midstream increased   30 million  in 2018  compared with 2017  the increase was primarily due to higher equity earnings from affiliates as a result of increased volumes timing of incentive distribution income allocations from dcp partners and favorable hedging results these increases were partially offset by higher asset impairments and operating costs in 2018 

see the “executive overview and business environment” section for information on market factors impacting 2018  results 

2017  vs 2016    

pretax income from the midstream segment increased   235 million  in 2017  compared with 2016  due to improved results across all business lines 

pretax income from our transportation business increased   88 million  in 2017  compared with 2016  the improvement was mainly driven by increased equity earnings from affiliates including our joint ventures that own the bakken pipeline which started commercial operations in june 2017 as well as rex due to our share of a favorable breach of contract settlement claim these increases were partially offset by higher operating costs 

pretax income from our ngl and other business increased   37 million  in 2017  compared with 2016  the increase reflected a full year of operations at the freeport lpg export terminal the contribution of merey sweeny to phillips 66 partners in october 2017 and higher equity earnings from dcp sand hills pipeline llc sand hills partially offset by lower realized margins 

pretax income from our investment in dcp midstream increased   110 million  in 2017  compared with 2016  the increase was primarily due to improved margins driven by higher average ngl and natural gas prices and improved hedging results

chemicals 

  



the chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent  interest in cpchem which we account for under the equity method cpchem uses ngl and other feedstocks to produce petrochemicals these products are then marketed and sold or used as feedstocks to produce plastics and other chemicals we structure our reporting of cpchem’s operations around two primary business lines olefins and polyolefins op and specialties aromatics and styrenics sas the op business line produces and markets ethylene and other olefin products ethylene produced is primarily consumed within cpchem for the production of polyethylene normal alpha olefins and polyethylene pipe the sas business line manufactures and markets aromatics and styrenics products such as benzene cyclohexane styrene and polystyrene sas also manufactures andor markets a variety of specialty chemical products unless otherwise noted amounts referenced below reflect our net 50 percent  interest in cpchem 

2018  vs 2017   

pretax income from the chemicals segment increased   309 million  in 2018  compared with 2017  the increased results reflected the commencement of full operations at cpchem’s new us gulf coast petrochemicals assets in the second quarter of 2018 which resulted in higher production and sales of polyethylene and ethylene partially offset by lower capitalized interest additionally lower hurricanerelated costs and downtime as well as lower impairment charges contributed to the increased results in 2018 

see the “executive overview and business environment” section for information on market factors impacting cpchem’s 2018  results 

2017  vs 2016   

pretax income from the chemicals segment decreased   123 million  in 2017  compared with 2016  the decrease was primarily driven by higher costs and lower volumes due to hurricane harvey as well as lower margins these items were partially offset by lower impairment charges higher equity in earnings from an op affiliate due to lower turnaround costs and a gain on the sale of cpchem’s kresin ®  styrenebutadiene copolymers business cpchem recognized impairment charges of 127 million and 177 million in 2017 and 2016 respectively due to lower demand and margin factors as a result of these impairments pretax income from the chemicals segment was reduced by 64 million and 89 million in 2017 and 2016 respectively 

as a result of hurricane harvey cpchem’s cedar bayou facility in baytown texas experienced severe flooding which caused it to shut down operations in the third quarter of 2017 this facility restarted in phases during the fourth quarter of 2017 startup of cpchem’s us gulf coast petrochemicals project was delayed by the flooding

the refining segment refines crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products such as gasoline distillates and aviation fuels at 13  refineries in the united states and europe 

2018  vs 2017   

pretax income for the refining segment increased   2459 million  in 2018  compared with 2017  the increase was primarily due to higher realized refining margins partially offset by a noncash gain of 423 million recognized on the consolidation of merey sweeny in february 2017 

the increased realized refining margins were primarily driven by higher feedstock advantage improved premium coke margins and increased optimization benefits from using our integrated logistics network to capture market opportunities related to widening bakken canadian and other inland crude differentials improved clean product differentials and lower renewable identification number rin costs also benefited margins these items were partially offset by a decline in market crack spreads 

see the “executive overview and business environment” section for information on industry crack spreads and other market factors impacting this year’s results 

our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 95 percent  in both 2018  and 2017

2017  vs 2016   

pretax income for the refining segment increased   1641 million  in 2017  compared with 2016  the increase was primarily due to higher realized refining margins and west coast volumes as well as a noncash gain of 423 million recognized on the consolidation of merey sweeny partially offset by higher turnaround expenses utilities costs and pension settlement expense the higher realized refining margins primarily resulted from improved market crack spreads and secondary product margins partially offset by lower feedstock advantage

marketing and specialties 

  



the ms segment purchases for resale and markets refined petroleum products such as gasoline distillates and aviation fuels mainly in the united states and europe in addition this segment includes the manufacturing and marketing of specialty products such as base oils and lubricants as well as power generation operations 

2018  vs 2017   

pretax income from the ms segment increased   537 million  in 2018  compared with 2017  the increase was primarily due to higher realized marketing fuel margins mainly driven by international marketing benefits from the retroactive extension of the 2017 us biodiesel blender’s tax incentive in early 2018 as well as improved specialty product service margins 

see the “executive overview and business environment” section for information on marketing fuel margins and other market factors impacting 2018  results

corporate and other 

  



2018  vs 2017   

net interest expense consists of interest and financing expense net of interest income and capitalized interest net interest expense increased   51 million  in 2018  compared with 2017  mainly due to higher average debt principal balances from our issuance of senior notes totaling 1500 million in march 2018 and phillips 66 partners’ issuance of senior notes totaling 650 million in october 2017 this increase was partially offset by higher interest income 

the category “other” includes environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation foreign currency transaction gains and losses and other costs not directly associated with an operating segment the 76 million  decrease in other costs in 2018 compared with 2017 was primarily attributable to lower environmentalrelated expenses and higher equity earnings from our share of income tax benefits recorded by equity affiliates due to the enactment of the tax act in december 2017 

2017  vs 2016   

net interest expense increased   86 million  in 2017  compared with 2016  primarily driven by lower capitalized interest due to the completion of major projects including completion of the freeport lpg export terminal project in late 2016 and higher interest expense driven by higher average debt principal balances due to phillips 66 partners’ debt issuances in october 2017 and 2016 

corporate general and administrative expenses increased   22 million  in 2017  compared with 2016  due to higher employeerelated costs

capital resources and liquidity 

financial indicators 



to meet our short and longterm liquidity requirements we look to a variety of funding sources but rely primarily on cash generated from operating activities additionally phillips 66 partners has raised funds for its growth activities through debt and equity financings during 2018  we generated 76 billion  in cash from operations and raised net proceeds of 15 billion  from the issuance of senior notes we used this available cash primarily for repurchases of our common stock of 46 billion  capital expenditures and investments of 26 billion  dividend payments on our common stock of 14 billion  and the early repayment of 550 million  of debt during 2018  cash and cash equivalents decreased  by 100 million  to 30 billion  

in addition to cash flows from operating activities we rely on our commercial paper and credit facility programs asset sales and our ability to issue debt securities to support our short and longterm liquidity requirements we believe current cash and cash equivalents and cash generated by operations together with access to external sources of funds as described below under “significant sources of capital” will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near and long term including our capital spending dividend payments defined benefit plan contributions debt repayment and share repurchases 

significant sources of capital 

operating activities 

during 2018  cash of 7573 million  was provided by operating activities a 108 percent   increase  compared with 2017  the increase  was primarily attributable to higher realized refining and marketing margins increased distributions from our equity affiliates and lower employee benefit plan contributions these increases were partially offset by unfavorable working capital impacts primarily driven by the effects of changes in commodity prices and the timing of payments and collections 

during 2017  cash of 3648 million  was provided by operating activities a 23 percent   increase  compared with 2016  the increase  was primarily attributable to improved operating results due to higher realized refining margins and increased distributions from our equity affiliates these increases were partially offset by working capital changes reflecting the negative impact of building inventory at higher commodity prices and timing of refining payables payments as well as lower marketing margins 

our short and longterm operating cash flows are highly dependent upon refining and marketing margins ngl prices and chemicals margins prices and margins in our industry are typically volatile and are driven by market conditions over which we have little or no control absent other mitigating factors as these prices and margins fluctuate we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows 

index to financial statements 

the level and quality of output from our refineries also impacts our cash flows factors such as operating efficiency maintenance turnarounds market conditions feedstock availability and weather conditions can affect output we actively manage the operations of our refineries and any variability in their operations typically has not been as significant to cash flows as that caused by margins and prices our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization was 95 percent  in both 2018  and 2017  

equity affiliates 

our operating cash flows are also impacted by distribution decisions made by our equity affiliates including dcp midstream cpchem and wrb over the three years ended december 31 2018  we received aggregate distributions from our equity affiliates of 4712 million  including 201 million  from dcp midstream 1603 million  from cpchem and 1124 million  from wrb cpchem resumed distributions to us in the first quarter of 2018 following the return to full operations of its cedar bayou facility posthurricane harvey and the startup of its new us gulf coast petrochemicals assets we cannot control the amount or timing of future distributions from equity affiliates therefore future distributions by these and other equity affiliates are not assured 

phillips 66 partners 

in 2013 we formed phillips 66 partners a publicly traded mlp to own operate develop and acquire primarily feebased midstream assets 

ownership 

at december 31 2018  we owned a 54 percent  limited partner interest and a 2 percent  general partner interest in phillips 66 partners while the public owned a 44 percent  limited partner interest and 138 million  perpetual convertible preferred units we consolidate phillips 66 partners as a variable interest entity for financial reporting purposes see note 27—phillips 66 partners lp  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on why we consolidate the partnership as a result of this consolidation the public common and preferred unitholders’ interests in phillips 66 partners are reflected as noncontrolling interests of 2469 million  in our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2018

index to financial statements 

availability of debt and equity financing 

our senior unsecured longterm debt has been rated investment grade by sp bbb and moody’s a3 we do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default and thereby impact our access to liquidity in the event of a downgrade of our credit rating if our credit rating deteriorated to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market we would expect to be able to access funds under our liquidity facilities mentioned above 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

under the operating lease agreement on our headquarters facility in houston texas we have a residual value guarantee with a maximum future exposure of 554 million  at december 31 2018 the operating lease term ends in june 2021  and provides us the option at the end of the lease term to request to renew the lease purchase the facility or assist the lessor in marketing it for resale we also have residual value guarantees associated with railcar and airplane leases with maximum future exposures totaling 300 million  at december 31 2018 which have remaining terms of up to five  years

contingencies 

a number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims that arose in the ordinary course of business have been filed against us or are subject to indemnifications provided by us we also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement storage disposal or release of certain chemical mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites we regularly assess the need for financial recognition or disclosure of these contingencies in the case of all known contingencies other than those related to income taxes we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable if a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount then the minimum of the range is accrued we do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or thirdparty recoveries if applicable we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other thirdparty recoveries in the case of incometaxrelated contingencies we use a cumulative probabilityweighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain 

based on currently available information we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements as we learn new facts concerning contingencies we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include contingent liabilities recorded for environmental remediation tax and legal matters estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other potentially responsible parties estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes 

legal and tax matters 

our legal and tax matters are handled by our legal and tax organizations these organizations apply their knowledge experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases and uncertain tax positions we employ a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases and enables the tracking of those cases that have been scheduled for trial andor mediation based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals or establishment of new accruals is required in the case of incometaxrelated contingencies we monitor tax legislation and court decisions the status of tax audits and the statute of limitations within which a taxing authority can assert a liability see note 21—income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about incometaxrelated contingencies

environmental 

like other companies in our industry we are subject to numerous international federal state and local environmental laws and regulations among the most significant of these international and federal environmental laws and regulations are the 

  

 these laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and in the case of discharges to water establish water quality limits they also in most cases require permits in association with new or modified operations these permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process which can be expensive and time consuming in addition there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency’s processing of the application many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant 

many states and foreign countries where we operate also have or are developing similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities while similar in some cases these regulations may impose additional or more stringent requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of developing infrastructure and marketing and transporting products across state and international borders for example in california the south coast air quality management district scaqmd approved amendments to the regional clean air incentives market reclaim that became effective in 2016 which require a phased reduction of nitrogen oxide emissions through 2022 and affect refineries in the los angeles metropolitan area in 2017 scaqmd required additional nitrogen dioxide emissions reductions through 2025 and is now promulgating new regulations to replace the reclaim program with a traditional command and controls regulatory regime 

the ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards such as air emission standards water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations continue to evolve however environmental laws and regulations including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the united states and in other countries in which we operate notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the united states 

an example of this in the fuels area is the energy independence and security act of 2007 eisa it requires fuel producers and importers to provide additional renewable fuels for transportation motor fuels and stipulates a mix of various types to be included through 2022 we have met the increasingly stringent requirements to date while establishing implementation operating and capital strategies along with advanced technology development to address projected future requirements it is uncertain how various future requirements contained in eisa and the regulations promulgated thereunder may be implemented and what their full impact may be on our operations for the 2019 compliance year the epa has set volumes of advanced and total renewable fuel at higher levels than in previous years the 2019 compliance year volumes are approximately 3 percent higher than those required for the 2018 and 2017 compliance years it is uncertain if these increased obligations will be achievable by fuel producers and shippers without 

index to financial statements 

drawing on the rin bank eisa requires epa to reset the statutory volumes if epa waives the volumes by 20 percent or more for two consecutive years the 2019 rulemaking triggered this requirement and epa is currently working on rulemaking that will set volumes for 2020 through 2022 additionally we may experience a decrease in demand for refined petroleum products due to the regulatory program as currently promulgated this program continues to be the subject of possible congressional review and repromulgation in revised form and the epa’s regulations pertaining to the 2014 through 2018 compliance years are subject to legal challenge further creating uncertainty regarding renewable fuel volume requirements and obligations additionally the market for rins has been the subject of fraudulent thirdparty activity and it is reasonably possible that some rins that we have purchased may be determined to be invalid should that occur we could incur costs to replace those fraudulent rins although the cost for replacing any fraudulently marketed rins is not reasonably estimable at this time we would not expect to incur the full financial impact of fraudulent rins replacement costs in any single interim or annual period and would not expect such costs to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

we also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations such laws and regulations include cercla and rcra and their state equivalents remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility arising from petroleum releases from underground storage tanks located at numerous previously and currently owned andor operated petroleummarketing outlets throughout the united states federal and state laws require contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards in addition to other cleanup standards many states have adopted cleanup criteria for methyl tertiarybutyl ether for both soil and groundwater 

at rcrapermitted facilities we are required to assess environmental conditions if conditions warrant we may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations in contrast to cercla which is often referred to as “superfund” the cost of corrective action activities under rcra corrective action programs typically is borne solely by us we anticipate increased expenditures for rcra remediation activities may be required but such annual expenditures for the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures we have experienced over the past few years longerterm expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly 

we occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the epa and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under cercla or an equivalent state statute on occasion we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties these requests notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations as of december 31 2017  we reported that we had been notified of potential liability under cercla and comparable state laws at 31  sites within the united states during 2018  we were notified of one  new site one  previously resolved site that was returned to active status four  sites that were deemed resolved and closed and two  sites that were deemed resolved but not closed leaving 27  unresolved sites with potential liability at december 31 2018  

for most superfund sites our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties is relatively low although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations and where they have not or where potentially responsible parties could not be located our share of liability has not increased materially many of the sites for which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the epa or the state agencies concerned prior to actual cleanup those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation in some instances we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain epa or equivalent state agency approval of a remediation plan there are relatively few sites where we are a major participant and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all cercla sites in the aggregate is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition 

expensed environmental costs were 690 million  in 2018  and are expected to be approximately 740 million  and 700 million  in 2019  and 2020  respectively capitalized environmental costs were 149 million  in 2018  and are expected to be approximately 115 million  and 125 million  in 2019  and 2020  respectively this amount does not include capital expenditures made for another purpose that have an indirect benefit on environmental compliance 

index to financial statements 

accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted except those assumed in a business combination which we record on a discounted basis 

many of these liabilities result from cercla rcra and similar state laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct or once conducted operations or at sites where our generated waste was disposed we also have accrued for a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation but which are not currently the subject of cercla rcra or state enforcement activities if applicable we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other thirdparty recoveries in the future we may incur significant costs under both cercla and rcra remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site depending on the mix of unique site characteristics evolving remediation technologies diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties therefore it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs 

notwithstanding any of the foregoing and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in certain of our operations and products and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred however we currently do not expect any material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations 

climate change 

there has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state national and international laws focusing on ghg emissions reduction including various regulations proposed or issued by the epa these proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in states andor countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future laws regulating ghg emissions continue to evolve and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation such laws potentially could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition as a result of increasing costs of compliance lengthening project implementation and agency reviews or reducing demand for certain hydrocarbon products examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include 

  

 

in the eu the first phase of the eu ets completed at the end of 2007 and phase ii was undertaken from 2008 through 2012 the current phase phase iii runs from 2013 through to 2020 with the main changes being reduced allocation of free allowances and increased auctioning of new allowances phillips 66 has assets that are subject to the eu ets and the company is actively engaged in minimizing any financial impact from the eu ets

from november 30 to december 12 2015 more than 190 countries including the united states participated in the united nations climate change conference in paris france the conference culminated in what is known as the “paris agreement” which upon certain conditions being met entered into force on november 4 2016 the paris agreement establishes a commitment by signatory parties to pursue domestic ghg emission reductions in 2017 the president of the united states announced his intention to withdraw the united states from the paris agreement 

in the united states some additional form of regulation is likely to be forthcoming in the future at the state or federal levels with respect to ghg emissions such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes the restriction of output investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances we are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations 

compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a ghg emission trading program ghg reduction requirements or carbon taxes could significantly increase our costs reduce demand for fossil energy derived products impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources 

an example of one such program is california’s cap and trade program which was promulgated pursuant to the state’s global warming solutions act the program had been limited to certain stationary sources which include our refineries in california but beginning in january 2015 was expanded to include emissions from transportation fuels distributed in california inclusion of transportation fuels in california’s cap and trade program as currently promulgated has increased our cap and trade program compliance costs the ultimate impact on our financial performance either positive or negative from this and similar programs will depend on a number of factors including but not limited to 

  

 

we consider and take into account anticipated future ghg emissions in designing and developing major facilities and projects and implement energy efficiency initiatives to reduce ghg emissions data on our ghg emissions legal requirements regulating such emissions and the possible physical effects of climate change on our coastal assets are incorporated into our planning investment and risk management decisionmaking

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses see note 1—summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for descriptions of our major accounting policies some of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions or if different assumptions had been used the following discussion of critical accounting estimates along with the discussion of contingencies in this report address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions could be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change 

impairments 

longlived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future expected cash flows if the sum of the undiscounted expected future pretax cash flows of an asset group is less than the carrying value including applicable liabilities the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets for example at a refinery complex level because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for longlived assets the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined using one or more of the following methods the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants a market multiple of earnings for similar assets or historical market transactions of similar assets adjusted using principal market participant assumptions when necessary the expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future volumes commodity prices operating costs margins discount rates and capital project decisions considering all available information at the date of review 

investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are assessed for impairment when there are indicators of a loss in value such as a lack of sustained earnings capacity or a current fair value less than the investment’s carrying amount when it is determined that an indicated impairment is other than temporary a charge is recognized for the difference between the investment’s carrying value and its estimated fair value 

when determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline the investee’s financial condition and nearterm prospects and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that allows for recovery when quoted market prices are not available the fair value is usually based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants and a market analysis of comparable assets if appropriate different assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period 

asset retirement obligations 

under various contracts permits and regulations we have legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land at the end of operations at certain operational sites our largest asset removal obligations involve asbestos abatement at refineries estimating the timing and cost of future asset removals is difficult most of these removal obligations are many years or decades in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs asset removal technologies and costs regulatory and other compliance considerations expenditure timing and other inputs into valuation of the obligation including discount and inflation rates are also subject to change 

environmental costs 

in addition to asset retirement obligations discussed above we have certain obligations to complete environmentalrelated projects these projects are primarily related to cleanup at domestic refineries underground storage sites and nonoperated sites future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs timing and extent of such remedial actions that may be required and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties 

index to financial statements 

intangible assets and goodwill 

at december 31 2018  we had 753 million  of intangible assets that we have determined to have indefinite useful lives and therefore are not amortized the judgmental determination that an intangible asset has an indefinite useful life is continuously evaluated if due to changes in facts and circumstances management determines these intangible assets have finite useful lives amortization will commence at that time on a prospective basis as long as these intangible assets are determined to have indefinite lives they will be subject to at least annual impairment tests that require management’s judgment of their estimated fair value 

at december 31 2018  we had 33 billion  of goodwill recorded in conjunction with past business combinations goodwill is not amortized instead goodwill is subject to at least annual tests for impairment at a reporting unit level a reporting unit is an operating segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment and they are determined primarily based on the manner in which the business is managed 

  

we perform our annual goodwill impairment test using either a qualitative assessment or a quantitative assessment as part of our qualitative assessment we evaluate relevant events and circumstances that could affect the fair value of our reporting units including macroeconomic conditions overall industry and market considerations and regulatory changes as well as companyspecific market metrics performance and events the evaluation of companyspecific events and circumstances includes evaluating changes in our stock price and cost of capital actual and forecasted financial performance as well as the effect of significant asset dispositions if our qualitative assessment indicates it is likely the fair value of a reporting unit has declined below its carrying value including goodwill or if we elect not to perform a qualitative assessment a quantitative assessment is performed 

when a quantitative assessment is performed management applies judgment in determining the estimated fair values of the reporting units because quoted market prices for our reporting units are not available management uses available information to make this fair value determination including estimated cash flows cost of capital observed market earnings multiples of comparable companies our common stock price and associated total company market capitalization 

we completed our annual impairment test as of october 1 2018 and concluded that the fair values of our reporting units continued to exceed their respective carrying values including goodwill by significant percentages a decline in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units in the future could result in an impairment as such we continue to monitor for indicators of impairment until our next annual impairment test is performed 

tax assets and liabilities 

our operations are subject to various taxes including federal state and foreign income taxes property taxes and transactional taxes such as excise salesuse and payroll taxes we record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations the recording of tax liabilities requires significant judgment and estimates we recognize the financial statement effects of an income tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority a contingent liability related to a transactional tax claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and estimable actual incurred tax liabilities can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons including different interpretations of tax laws and regulations and different assessments of the amount of tax due 

in determining our income tax expense benefit we assess the likelihood our deferred tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income valuation allowances reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized judgment is required in estimating the amount of valuation allowance if any that should be recorded against our deferred tax assets based on our historical taxable income our expectations for the future and available taxplanning strategies we expect the net deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as reductions to future taxable income if our actual results of operations differ from such estimates or our estimates of future taxable income change the valuation allowance may need to be revised 

new tax laws and regulations as well as changes to existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being proposed or promulgated the implementation of future legislative and regulatory tax initiatives could result in increased income tax liabilities that cannot be predicted at this time

projected benefit obligations 

calculation of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans impacts the obligations on the balance sheet and the amount of benefit expense in the income statement the actuarial calculation of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events including estimated retirement dates salary levels at retirement mortality rates lumpsum election rates rates of return on plan assets future interest rates future health care costtrend rates and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the calculation of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements due to the specialized nature of these calculations due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects ultimately we will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions a one percentagepoint decrease in the discount rate assumption used for the plan obligation would increase annual benefit expense by an estimated 50 million while a one percentagepoint decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by an estimated 30 million in determining the discount rate we use yields on highquality fixed income investments with payments matched to the estimated distributions of benefits from our plans 

in 2018 and 2017 the expected weightedaverage longterm rate of return for worldwide pension plan assets was approximately 6 percent while the actual weightedaverage rate of return was a negative 4 percent  in 2018 and a positive 15 percent  in 2017 for the past ten years our actual weightedaverage rate of return for worldwide pension plan assets was 9 percent

new accounting standards 

in february 2018 the fasb issued asu no 201802 “income statement—reporting comprehensive income topic 220 reclassification of certain tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income” this asu allows for the deferred income tax effects stranded in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci resulting from the tax act enacted in december 2017 to be reclassed from aoci to retained earnings this asu is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after december 15 2018 with early adoption permitted upon adoption on january 1 2019 we increased retained earnings by approximately 90 million  with the offset to accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet 

in june 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201613 “financial instruments—credit losses topic 326 measurement of credit losses on financial instruments” the new standard amends the impairment model to utilize an expected loss methodology in place of the currently used incurred loss methodology which may result in earlier recognition of losses public business entities should apply the guidance in asu no 201613 for annual periods beginning after december 15 2019 including interim periods within those annual periods early adoption will be permitted for annual periods beginning after december 15 2018 we are evaluating the provisions of asu no 201613 and currently do not expect our adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in february 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201602 “leases topic 842” the new standard establishes a rightofuse rou model that requires a lessee to record a rou asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months leases will continue to be classified as either finance or operating with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement similarly lessors will be required to classify leases as salestype finance or operating with classification affecting the pattern of income recognition classification for both lessees and lessors will be based on an assessment of whether risks and rewards as well as substantive control have been transferred through a lease contract the asu also requires additional disclosures public business entities should apply the guidance in asu no 201602 for annual periods beginning after december 15 2018 including interim periods within those annual periods early adoption is permitted we will adopt asu no 201602 by recognizing a cumulativeeffect adjustment to our opening consolidated balance sheet as of our january 1 2019 adoption date as of the adoption date we expect to recognize rou assets and operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet of approximately 14 billion  the adoption of this asu is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated statements of income and cash flows

refining 

our realized refining margins measure the difference between a sales and other operating revenues derived from the sale of petroleum products manufactured at our refineries and b purchase costs of feedstocks primarily crude oil used to produce the petroleum products the realized refining margins are adjusted to include our proportional share of our joint venture refineries’ realized margins as well as to exclude those items that are not representative of the underlying operating performance of a period which we call “special items” the realized refining margins are converted to a perbarrel basis by dividing them by total refinery processed inputs primarily crude oil measured on a barrel basis including our share of inputs processed by our joint venture refineries our realized refining margin per barrel is intended to be comparable with industry refining margins which are known as “crack spreads” as discussed in “business environment” industry crack spreads measure the difference between market prices for refined petroleum products and crude oil we believe realized refining margin per barrel calculated on a similar basis as industry crack spreads provides a useful measure of how well we performed relative to benchmark industry margins 

the gaap performance measure most directly comparable to realized refining margin per barrel is the refining segment’s “income before income taxes per barrel” realized refining margin per barrel excludes items that are typically included in a manufacturer’s gross margin such as depreciation and operating expenses and other items used to determine income before income taxes such as general and administrative expenses it also includes our proportional share of joint venture refineries’ realized refining margins and excludes special items because realized refining margin per barrel is calculated in this manner and because realized refining margin per barrel may be defined differently by other companies in our industry it has limitations as an analytical tool following are reconciliations of income before income taxes to realized refining margins

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial instrument market risk 

we and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose our cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates we may use financial and commoditybased derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of crude oil and related products natural gas ngl and electric power fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates or to capture market opportunities 

our use of derivative instruments is governed by an “authority limitations” document approved by our board of directors that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient market liquidity for comparable valuations the authority limitations document also establishes value at risk var limits and compliance with these limits is monitored daily our chief executive officer and chief financial officer monitor risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices 

commodity price risk 

we sell into and receive supply from the worldwide crude oil refined petroleum product natural gas ngl and electric power markets exposing our revenues purchases cost of operating activities and cash flows to fluctuations in the prices for these commodities generally our policy is to remain exposed to the market prices of commodities consistent with this policy our commercial organization uses derivative contracts to convert our exposure from fixedprice sales contracts often specified in contracts with refined petroleum product customers back to fluctuating market prices conversely our commercial organization also uses futures forwards swaps and options in various markets to accomplish the following objectives to optimize the value of our supply chain and this may reduce our exposure to fluctuations in market prices 

 

we use a var model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments held or issued including commodity purchase and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at december 31 2018  as derivative instruments using the monte carlo simulation a 95 percent confidence level and a oneday holding period the var for those instruments issued or held for trading purposes at december 31 2018  and 2017  was immaterial to our cash flows and net income the var for instruments held for purposes other than trading at december 31 2018  and 2017  was also immaterial to our cash flows and net income

interest rate risk

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form 10k each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition as well as affect the value of an investment in our common stock 

our operating results and future rate of growth are exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices and refining marketing and petrochemical margins 

our revenues operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent on a number of factors including fixed and variable expenses including the cost of crude oil ngl and other refining and petrochemical feedstocks and the margin we can derive from selling refined and chemicals segment products the prices of feedstocks and our products fluctuate substantially these prices depend on numerous factors beyond our control including the global supply and demand for feedstocks and our products which are subject to among other things 

  

 

the price of crude oil influences prices for refined products we do not produce crude oil and must purchase all of the crude oil we process many crude oils available on the world market will not meet the quality restrictions for use in our refineries others are not economical to use due to high transportation costs or for other reasons the prices for crude oil and refined products can fluctuate differently based on global regional and local market conditions in addition the timing of the relative movement of the prices both among different classes of refined products and among various global markets for similar refined products as well as the overall change in refined product prices can reduce refining margins and could have a significant impact on our refining wholesale marketing and retail operations revenues operating income and cash flows also crude oil supply contracts generally have marketresponsive pricing provisions we normally purchase our refinery feedstocks weeks before manufacturing and selling the refined products changes in prices that occur between when we purchase feedstocks and when we sell the refined products produced from these feedstocks could have a significant effect on our financial results we also purchase refined products produced by others for sale to our customers price changes that occur between when we purchase and sell these refined products also could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the price of feedstocks also influences prices for petrochemical and plastics products although our chemicals segment transports and fractionates feedstocks to meet a portion of their demand and has certain longterm feedstock supply contracts with others it is still subject to volatile feedstock prices in addition the petrochemicals industry is both cyclical and volatile cyclicality occurs when periods of tight supply resulting in increased prices and profit margins are followed by periods of capacity expansion resulting in oversupply and declining prices and profit margins volatility occurs as a result of changes in supply and demand for products changes in energy prices and changes in various other economic conditions around the world 

uncertainty and illiquidity in credit and capital markets can impair our ability to obtain credit and financing on acceptable terms and can adversely affect the financial strength of our business partners 

our ability to obtain credit and capital depends in large measure on the state of the credit and capital markets which is beyond our control our ability to access credit and capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like or need access to those markets which could constrain our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions in addition the cost and availability of debt and equity financing may be adversely impacted by unstable or illiquid market conditions protracted uncertainty and illiquidity in these markets also could have an adverse impact on our lenders commodity hedging counterparties or our customers preventing them from meeting their obligations to us 

index to financial statements 

from time to time our cash needs may exceed our internally generated cash flow and our business could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to obtain necessary funds from financing activities from time to time we may need to supplement cash generated from operations with proceeds from financing activities uncertainty and illiquidity in financial markets may materially impact the ability of the participating financial institutions to fund their commitments to us under our liquidity facilities accordingly we may not be able to obtain the full amount of the funds available under our liquidity facilities to satisfy our cash requirements and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position 

deterioration in our credit profile could increase our costs of borrowing money and limit our access to the capital markets and commercial credit and could trigger coventurer rights under jointventure arrangements 

our or phillips 66 partners’ credit ratings could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment the circumstances warrant if a rating agency were to downgrade our rating below investment grade our or phillips 66 partners’ borrowing costs would increase and our funding sources could decrease in addition a failure by us to maintain an investment grade rating could affect our business relationships with suppliers and operating partners for example our agreement with chevron regarding cpchem permits chevron to buy our 50 percent interest in cpchem for fair market value if we experience a change in control or if both standard  poor’s and moody’s lower our credit ratings below investment grade and the credit rating from either rating agency remains below investment grade for 365 days thereafter with fair market value determined by agreement or by nationally recognized investment banks as a result of these factors a downgrade of credit ratings could have a materially adverse impact on our future operations and financial position 

we expect to continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of our compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations likewise future environmental laws and regulations may impact or limit our current business plans and reduce demand for our products 

our business is subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment these laws and regulations continue to increase in both number and complexity and affect our operations with respect to among other things 

  

 

we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital operating and maintenance and remediation expenditures as a result of these laws and regulations to the extent these expenditures as with all costs are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in future periods could be materially adversely affected 

the us environmental protection agency epa has implemented a renewable fuel standard rfs pursuant to the energy policy act of 2005 and the energy independence and security act of 2007 the rfs program sets annual quotas for the quantity of renewable fuels such as ethanol that must be blended into motor fuels consumed in the united states to provide certain flexibility in compliance options available to the industry a renewable identification number rin is assigned to each gallon of renewable fuel produced in or imported into the united states as a producer of petroleumbased motor fuels we are obligated to blend renewable fuels into the products we produce at a rate that is at least commensurate to the epa’s quota and to the extent we do not we must purchase rins in the open market to satisfy our obligation under the rfs program to the extent the epa mandates a blending quantity of renewable fuel that exceeds the amount that is commercially feasible to blend into motor fuel a situation commonly referred to as “the blend wall” our operations could be materially adversely impacted up to and including a reduction in produced motor fuel 

index to financial statements 

the adoption of climate change legislation or regulation could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the refined products we produce 

the us government including the epa as well as several state and international governments have either considered or adopted legislation or regulations in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas ghg emissions these proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in states andor countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future in addition various groups suggest that additional laws may be needed in an effort to address climate change as illustrated by the paris agreement negotiated at the 2015 united nations conference on climate change referred to as cop 21 which entered into force on november 4 2016 we cannot predict the extent to which any such legislation or regulation will be enacted and if so what its provisions would be to the extent we incur additional costs required to comply with the adoption of new laws and regulations that are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in future periods could be materially adversely affected in addition demand for the refined products we produce could be adversely affected 

climate change may adversely affect our facilities and our ongoing operations 

the potential physical effects of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and depend upon the unique geographic and environmental factors present examples of such effects include rising sea levels at our coastal facilities changing storm patterns and intensities and changing temperature levels as many of our facilities are located near coastal areas rising sea levels may disrupt our ability to operate those facilities or transport crude oil and refined petroleum products extended periods of such disruption could have an adverse effect on our results of operation we could also incur substantial costs to prevent or repair damage to these facilities 

domestic and worldwide political and economic developments could affect our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows 

actions of the us state local and international governments through tax and other legislation or regulation executive order permit or other review of infrastructure or facility development and commercial restrictions could delay projects increase costs limit development or otherwise reduce our operating profitability both in the united states and abroad any such actions may affect many aspects of our operations including requiring permits or other approvals that may impose unforeseen or unduly burdensome conditions or potentially cause delays in our operations further limiting or prohibiting construction or other activities in environmentally sensitive or other areas requiring increased capital costs to construct maintain or upgrade equipment or facilities or restricting the locations where we may construct facilities or requiring the relocation of facilities in addition the us government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries these restrictions and those of foreign governments could limit our ability to operate in or gain access to various countries as well as limit our ability to obtain the optimum slate of crude oil and other refinery feedstocks our foreign operations and those of our joint ventures are further subject to risks of loss of revenue equipment and property as a result of expropriation acts of terrorism war civil unrest and other political risks unilateral or forced renegotiation modification or nullification of existing contracts with governmental entities and difficulties enforcing rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations our foreign operations and those of our joint ventures are also subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates actions by both the united states and host governments may affect our operations significantly in the future 

renewable fuels alternative energy mandates and energy conservation efforts could reduce demand for refined products tax incentives and other subsidies can make renewable fuels and alternative energy more competitive with refined products than they otherwise might be which may reduce refined product margins and hinder the ability of refined products to compete with renewable fuels 

large capital projects can take many years to complete and market conditions could deteriorate significantly between the project approval date and the project startup date negatively impacting project returns 

our basis for approving a largescale capital project is the expectation that it will deliver an acceptable level of return on the capital invested we base these forecasted project economics on our best estimate of future market conditions most largescale projects take several years to complete during this multiyear period market conditions can change from those we forecast and these changes could be significant accordingly we may not be able to realize our expected 

index to financial statements 

returns from a large investment in a capital project and this could negatively impact our results of operations cash flows and our return on capital employed 

our investments in joint ventures decrease our ability to manage risk 

we conduct some of our operations including parts of our midstream refining and ms segments and our entire chemicals segment through joint ventures in which we share control with our jointventure participants our jointventure participants may have economic business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours or those of the joint venture or our jointventure participants may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone failure by us or an entity in which we have a jointventure interest to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisitions or joint ventures could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our joint ventures and in turn our business and operations 

activities in our chemicals and midstream segments involve numerous risks that may result in accidents that could affect the ability of our equity affiliates to make distributions to us 

there are a variety of hazards and operating risks inherent in the manufacturing of petrochemicals and the gathering processing transmission storage and distribution of natural gas and ngl such as spills leaks explosions and mechanical problems that could cause substantial financial losses in addition these risks could result in significant injury loss of human life damage to property environmental pollution and impairment of operations any of which could result in substantial losses for assets located near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers industrial sites and other public gathering areas the level of damage resulting from these risks could be greater should any of these risks materialize it could have a material adverse effect on the business and financial condition of our equity affiliates in these segments and negatively impact their ability to make future distributions to us 

our operations present hazards and risks which may not be fully covered by insurance if insured if a significant accident or event occurs for which we are not adequately insured our operations and financial results could be adversely affected 

the scope and nature of our operations present a variety of operational hazards and risks including explosions fires toxic emissions maritime hazards and natural catastrophes that must be managed through continual oversight and control for example the operation of refineries power plants fractionators pipelines terminals and vessels is inherently subject to the risks of spills discharges or other inadvertent releases of petroleum or hazardous substances if any of these events had previously occurred or occurs in the future in connection with any of our refineries pipelines or refined products terminals or in connection with any facilities that receive our wastes or byproducts for treatment or disposal other than events for which we are indemnified we could be liable for all costs and penalties associated with their remediation under federal state local and international environmental laws or common law and could be liable for property damage to third parties caused by contamination from releases and spills these and other risks are present throughout our operations as protection against these hazards and risks we maintain insurance against many but not all potential losses or liabilities arising from such operating risks as such our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover us against potential losses arising from such risks uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating risks could reduce the funds available to us for capital and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to interruptions of supply and increased costs as a result of our reliance on thirdparty transportation of crude oil ngl and refined products 

we often utilize the services of third parties to transport crude oil ngl and refined products to and from our facilities in addition to our own operational risks discussed above we could experience interruptions of supply or increases in costs to deliver refined products to market if the ability of the pipelines or vessels to transport crude oil or refined products is disrupted because of weather events accidents governmental regulations or thirdparty actions a prolonged disruption of the ability of a pipeline or vessel to transport crude oil ngl or refined products to or from one or more of our refineries or other facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

index to financial statements 

increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in us production of crude oil and natural gas which could adversely impact our results of operations 

an increasing percentage of crude oil supplied to our refineries and the crude oil and gas production of our midstream segment’s customers is being produced from unconventional oil shale reservoirs these reservoirs require hydraulic fracturing completion processes to release the hydrocarbons from the rock so they can flow through casing to the surface hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water sand and chemicals under pressure into the formation to stimulate hydrocarbon production the epa as well as several state agencies have commenced studies andor convened hearings regarding the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities at the same time certain environmental groups have suggested that additional laws may be needed to more closely and uniformly regulate the hydraulic fracturing process and legislation has been proposed to provide for such regulation in addition some communities have adopted measures to ban hydraulic fracturing in their communities we cannot predict whether any such legislation will ever be enacted and if so what its provisions would be any additional levels of regulation and permits required with the adoption of new laws and regulations at the federal or state level could result in our having to rely on higher priced crude oil for our refineries this could lead to delays increased operating costs and process prohibitions that could reduce the volumes of natural gas that move through dcp midstream’s gathering systems and could reduce supplies and increase costs of ngl feedstocks to cpchem ethylene facilities this could materially adversely affect our results of operations and the ability of dcp midstream and cpchem to make cash distributions to us 

dcp midstream’s success depends on its ability to obtain new sources of natural gas and ngl any decrease in the volumes of natural gas dcp midstream gathers could adversely affect its business and operating results 

dcp midstream’s gathering and transportation pipeline systems are connected to or dependent on the level of production from natural gas wells which naturally declines over time as a result its cash flows associated with these wells will also decline over time in order to maintain or increase throughput levels on its gathering and transportation pipeline systems and ngl pipelines and the asset utilization rates at its natural gas processing plants dcp midstream must continually obtain new supplies the primary factors affecting dcp midstream’s ability to obtain new supplies of natural gas and ngl and to attract new customers to its assets include the level of successful drilling activity near these assets prices of and the demand for natural gas and crude oil producers’ desire and ability to obtain necessary permits in an efficient manner natural gas field characteristics and production performance surface access and infrastructure issues and its ability to compete for volumes from successful new wells if dcp midstream is not able to obtain new supplies of natural gas to replace the natural decline in volumes from existing wells or because of competition throughput on its pipelines and the utilization rates of its treating and processing facilities would decline this could have a material adverse effect on its business results of operations financial position and cash flows and its ability to make cash distributions to us 

competitors that produce their own supply of feedstocks have more extensive retail outlets or have greater financial resources may have a competitive advantage 

the refining and marketing industry is highly competitive with respect to both feedstock supply and refined product markets we compete with many companies for available supplies of crude oil and other feedstocks and for outlets for our refined products we do not produce any of our crude oil feedstocks some of our competitors however obtain a portion of their feedstocks from their own production and some have more extensive retail outlets than we have competitors that have their own production or extensive retail outlets and greater brandname recognition are at times able to offset losses from refining operations with profits from producing or retailing operations and may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages 

some of our competitors also have materially greater financial and other resources than we have such competitors have a greater ability to bear the economic risks inherent in all phases of our business in addition we compete with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel requirements of our industrial commercial and individual customers 

index to financial statements 

we may incur losses as a result of our forwardcontract activities and derivative transactions 

we currently use commodity derivative instruments and we expect to use them in the future if the instruments we utilize to hedge our exposure to various types of risk are not effective we may incur losses derivative transactions involve the risk that counterparties may be unable to satisfy their obligations to us the risk of counterparty default is heightened in a poor economic environment 

one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of a publicly traded master limited partnership phillips 66 partners which may involve a greater exposure to legal liability than our historic business operations 

one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of phillips 66 partners a publicly traded master limited partnership our control of the general partner of phillips 66 partners may increase the possibility that we could be subject to claims of breach of fiduciary duties including claims of conflicts of interest related to phillips 66 partners any liability resulting from such claims could have a material adverse effect on our future business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a significant interruption in one or more of our facilities could adversely affect our business 

our operations could be subject to significant interruption if one or more of our facilities were to experience a major accident mechanical failure or power outage encounter work stoppages relating to organized labor issues be damaged by severe weather or other natural or manmade disaster such as an act of terrorism or otherwise be forced to shut down if any facility were to experience an interruption in operations earnings from the facility could be materially adversely affected to the extent not recoverable through insurance if insured because of lost production and repair costs a significant interruption in one or more of our facilities could also lead to increased volatility in prices for feedstocks and refined products and could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets making it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain insurance coverage that we consider adequate 

our performance depends on the uninterrupted operation of our facilities which are becoming increasingly dependent on our information technology systems 

our performance depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of the manufacturing equipment in our production facilities the inability to operate one or more of our facilities due to a natural disaster power outage labor dispute or failure of one or more of our information technology telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to manufacture our products our manufacturing equipment is becoming increasingly dependent on our information technology systems a disruption in our information technology systems due to a catastrophic event or security breach could interrupt or damage our operations 

security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability which would cause our business and reputation to suffer 

in the ordinary course of our business we collect sensitive data including personally identifiable information of our customers using credit cards at our branded retail outlets despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure   or information technology and infrastructure of our thirdparty service providers eg cloudbased service providers may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions although we have experienced occasional actual or attempted breaches of our cybersecurity none of these breaches has had a material effect on our business operations or reputation or compromised any customer data any such breaches could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability under laws that protect the privacy of customer information disrupt the services we provide to customers and damage our reputation any of which could adversely affect our business

the level of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the expected return on plan assets for our pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans are evaluated by us based on a variety of independent sources of market information and in consultation with outside actuaries if we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected longterm rate of return or health care cost trend rate our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses and funding requirements could increase in addition several factors could cause actual results to differ significantly from the actuarial assumptions that we use funding obligations are determined based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date as required under relevant regulations future pension funding requirements and the timing of funding payments could be affected by legislation enacted by governmental authorities 

in connection with the separation conocophillips has indemnified us for certain liabilities and we have agreed to indemnify conocophillips for certain liabilities if we are required to act on these indemnities to conocophillips we may need to use cash to meet those obligations and our financial results could be negatively impacted the conocophillips indemnity may not be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of liabilities for which it has been allocated responsibility and conocophillips may not be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future 

pursuant to the indemnification and release agreement and certain other agreements with conocophillips entered into in connection with the separation conocophillips agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities and we agreed to indemnify conocophillips for certain liabilities indemnities that we may be required to provide conocophillips are not subject to any cap may be significant and could negatively impact our business particularly indemnities relating to our actions that could impact the taxfree nature of the distribution of phillips 66 stock third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that conocophillips has agreed to retain further the indemnity from conocophillips may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities and conocophillips may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations moreover even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from conocophillips any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves each of these risks could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to continuing contingent liabilities of conocophillips following the separation 

notwithstanding the separation there are several significant areas where the liabilities of conocophillips may become our obligations for example under the internal revenue code and the related rules and regulations each corporation that was a member of the conocophillips consolidated us federal income tax reporting group during any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the effective time of the separation is jointly and severally liable for the us federal income tax liability of the entire conocophillips consolidated tax reporting group for that taxable period in connection with the separation we entered into the tax sharing agreement with conocophillips that allocates the responsibility for prior period taxes of the conocophillips consolidated tax reporting group between us and conocophillips conocophillips may be unable to pay any prior period taxes for which it is responsible and we could be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes other provisions of federal law establish similar liability for other matters including laws governing taxqualified pension plans as well as other contingent liabilities 

if the distribution in connection with the separation together with certain related transactions does not qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes our stockholders and conocophillips could be subject to significant tax liability and in certain circumstances we could be required to indemnify conocophillips for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax sharing agreement 

conocophillips received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service irs substantially to the effect that among other things the distribution together with certain related transactions qualified as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code the private letter ruling and the tax opinion that conocophillips received relied on certain representations assumptions and undertakings including those relating to the past and future conduct of our business and neither the private letter ruling nor the opinion would be valid if such representations assumptions and undertakings were incorrect moreover the private letter ruling does not address all the issues that are relevant to determining whether the distribution qualified for taxfree treatment notwithstanding the private letter ruling and the tax opinion the irs could determine the distribution should be treated as a taxable transaction for us federal income tax purposes if it determines any of the representations assumptions or 

index to financial statements 

undertakings that were included in the request for the private letter ruling are false or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion that are not covered by the irs ruling 

if the irs were to determine that the distribution failed to qualify for taxfree treatment in general conocophillips would be subject to tax as if it had sold the phillips 66 common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value and conocophillips stockholders who received shares of phillips 66 common stock in the distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares 

under the tax sharing agreement we would generally be required to indemnify conocophillips against any tax resulting from the distribution to the extent that such tax resulted from i any of our representations or undertakings being incorrect or violated or ii other actions or failures to act by us our indemnification obligations to conocophillips and its subsidiaries officers and directors are not limited by any maximum amount if we are required to indemnify conocophillips or such other persons under the circumstances set forth in the tax sharing agreement we may be subject to substantial liabilities

business environment 

commodity prices rose significantly during 2017  compared with 2016 the discount for the us crude oil benchmark west texas intermediate wti versus the international benchmark brent widened over much of 2017  initially related to extended production cuts by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec and certain nonopec countries but further widened with hurricane harvey and logistical issues at the cushing oklahoma trading hub over the course of 2017 commodity prices had both favorable and unfavorable impacts on our businesses that vary by segment 

net income in the midstream segment which includes our 50 percent equity investment in dcp midstream is closely linked to natural gas liquids ngl prices natural gas prices and crude oil prices average natural gas prices increased in 2017 compared with 2016 due to higher demand and low production in early 2017 in the fourth quarter of 2017 natural gas prices gained momentum with colder temperatures and increased residential and commercial heating demand total us natural gas production also increased through the fourth quarter of 2017 largely from dry gas in the marcellus play and associated gas from the permian basin ngl prices improved throughout 2017  due to international demand 

  

the chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in cpchem the chemicals and plastics industry is mainly a commoditybased industry where the margins for key products are based on supply and demand as well as cost factors during 2017  the chemicals and plastics industry continued to benefit from feedstock cost advantages associated with manufacturing ethylene in regions of the world with significant ngl production the price of crude oil is rising faster than ngl prices and thus the petrochemicals industry continues to experience lower ethylene cash costs in regions of the world where ethylene manufacturing is based upon ngl rather than crude oilderived feedstocks in particular companies with north american ethanebased crackers have benefited and have captured a somewhat higher polyethylene chain margin the ethylenetopolyethylene chain margins expanded in 2017 because of the crude oil price recovery after the significant decline in oil prices that began in 2014 

our refining segment results are driven by several factors including refining margins cost control refinery throughput feedstock costs product yields and turnaround activity industry crack spread indicators the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil are used to estimate refining margins during 2017  the us 321 crack spread three barrels of crude oil producing two barrels of gasoline and one barrel of diesel strengthened across all quarters compared with 2016 largely attributable to higher product demand and lower product inventories in the last half of 2017 due to hurricane harvey northwest european crack spreads on average increased in 2017 compared with 2016 also due to higher demand 

results for our ms segment depend largely on marketing fuel margins lubricant margins and other specialty product margins while ms margins are primarily driven by market factors largely determined by the relationship between supply and demand marketing fuel margins in particular are influenced by the trend in spot prices for refined products generally speaking a downward trend of spot prices has a favorable impact on marketing fuel margins while an upward trend of spot prices has an unfavorable impact on marketing fuel margins spot prices moved upward in 2017 following the increase in crude oil prices

results of operations 

basis of presentation 

during the fourth quarter of 2017 the segment performance measure used by our chief executive officer to assess performance and allocate resources was changed from “net income attributable to phillips 66” to “net income” this change reflects the recognition that management does not differentiate between those earnings attributable to phillips 66 and those attributable to noncontrolling interests when making operating and resource allocation decisions impacting segment performance prior period segment information has been recast to conform to the current presentation   

consolidated results 

a summary of net income loss by business segment with a reconciliation to net income attributable to phillips 66 follows

income statement analysis 

2017  vs 2016   

sales and other operating revenues  and purchased crude oil and products   increased   21 percent  and 27 percent  respectively in 2017  the increases were primarily due to higher prices for petroleum products crude oil and ngl 

equity in earnings of affiliates   increased   22 percent  in 2017  primarily resulting from higher equity in earnings from dcp midstream and other affiliates in our midstream segment as well as wrb partially offset by lower results from cpchem 

 

other income   increased   447 million  in 2017  we recognized a noncash pretax gain of 423 million  in february 2017 related to the consolidation of mslp see note 5—business combinations  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

operating expenses   increased   10 percent  in 2017  this increase was mainly due to the consolidation of a transportation joint venture in december 2016 as well as higher refining turnaround expenses and utility costs pension settlement expense and costs associated with a full year of operations at the freeport lpg export terminal these increases were partially offset by lower costs due to the sale of the whitegate refinery in 2016 

depreciation and amortization   increased   13 percent  in 2017  due to the freeport lpg export terminal beginning operations in late 2016 as well as other assets placed in service in 2017 

interest and debt expense   increased   30 percent  in 2017  this increase was primarily due to lower capitalized interest from the completion of major projects including the startup of the freeport lpg export terminal in late 2016 as well as higher average debt principal balances 

index to financial statements 

income tax expense benefit  was a benefit in 2017  compared with expense in 2016 primarily due to the 2735 million  provisional income tax benefit from the enactment of the tax act in december 2017 this benefit was partially offset by higher income tax expense from increased income before income taxes see note 21—income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our income taxes 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interest   increased   53 million  in 2017  reflecting the contribution of assets to phillips 66 partners during 2017  and late 2016 see note 27— phillips 66 partners lp  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 

2016  vs 2015   

sales and other operating revenues  and purchased crude oil and products  both decreased 15 percent in 2016 the decreases were primarily due to lower average prices for petroleum products and crude oil while average ngl prices were slightly improved during 2016 

equity in earnings of affiliates  decreased 10 percent in 2016 primarily resulting from decreased earnings from cpchem and wrb partially offset by improved results from dcp midstream 

 

net gain on dispositions  decreased 273 million in 2016 in 2015 we recognized a 242 million deferred gain related to the sale of ichp see note 6—assets held for sale or sold  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information

segment results 

midstream 

  





 pipelines represent the sum of volumes transported through each separately tariffed pipeline segment including our share of equity volumes from yellowstone pipe line company and lake charles pipe line company 

  excludes dcp midstream 

 represents 100 percent of dcp midstream’s volumes 



 based on index prices from the mont belvieu and conway market hubs that are weighted by ngl component and location mix 

the midstream segment provides crude oil and refined products transportation terminaling and processing services as well as natural gas ngl and liquefied petroleum gas lpg transportation storage processing and marketing services mainly in the united states this segment includes our master limited partnership mlp phillips 66 partners as well as our 50 percent  equity investment in dcp midstream which includes the operations of its mlp dcp midstream lp dcp partners 

2017  vs 2016   

net income from the midstream segment increased   184 million  in 2017  compared with 2016  due to improved results across all business lines   

transportation net income increased   65 million  in 2017  compared with 2016  the improvement was mainly driven by increased equity in earnings from affiliates including our joint ventures that own the bakken pipeline which started commercial operations in june 2017 as well as rockies express pipeline llc rex due to our share of a favorable breach of contract settlement claim these increases were partially offset by higher operating costs 

index to financial statements 

net income from our ngl and other business increased   41 million  in 2017  compared with 2016  the increase reflects a full year of operations at the freeport lpg export terminal the contribution of mslp to phillips 66 partners in october 2017 and higher equity earnings from dcp sand hills pipeline llc sand hills partially offset by lower realized margins 

net income from our investment in dcp midstream improved 78 million  in 2017  compared with 2016  the increase was primarily due to improved margins driven by higher average ngl and natural gas prices and improved results from dcp midstream’s hedging program 

see the “business environment and executive overview” section for information on market factors impacting 2017  results 

2016  vs 2015    

net income from the midstream segment increased   206 million  in 2016 compared with 2015 the increase was primarily due to improved results from dcp midstream partially offset by lower net income from our transportation and ngl and other businesses 

transportation net income decreased   24 million  in 2016 compared with 2015 lower net income primarily resulted from higher operating costs and increased depreciation expense due to growth projects these items were partially offset by higher revenues from increased throughput volumes and higher tariffs 

net income from our ngl and other business decreased   61 million  in 2016 compared with 2015 the decrease was primarily driven by lower realized margins as well as increased depreciation and operating expenses associated with the sweeny fractionator and late in the year the freeport lpg export terminal these items were partially offset by higher fractionated volumes reflecting the operation of the sweeny fractionator for a full year in 2016 and the benefit of the first liquefied petroleum gas cargos exported from the freeport lpg export terminal in late 2016 

improved results from our investment in dcp midstream increased our net income by 291 million  in 2016 compared with 2015 in 2015 dcp midstream recorded goodwill and other asset impairments which reduced our net income by 232 million in addition favorable contract restructuring efforts improved asset performance higher equity in earnings from dcp midstream’s equity affiliates lower operating costs and higher ngl prices contributed to better results in 2016 these improvements were partially offset by lower natural gas and crude oil prices

chemicals 

  



the chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in cpchem which we account for under the equity method cpchem uses ngl and other feedstocks to produce petrochemicals these products are then marketed and sold or used as feedstocks to produce plastics and other chemicals we structure our reporting of cpchem’s operations around two primary business segments olefins and polyolefins op and specialties aromatics and styrenics sas the op business segment produces and markets ethylene and other olefin products ethylene produced is primarily consumed within cpchem for the production of polyethylene normal alpha olefins and polyethylene pipe the sas business segment manufactures and markets aromatics and styrenics products such as benzene styrene paraxylene and cyclohexane as well as polystyrene sas also manufactures andor markets a variety of specialty chemical products unless otherwise noted amounts referenced below reflect our net 50 percent interest in cpchem 

2017  vs 2016   

net income from the chemicals segment decreased   58 million  in 2017  compared with 2016  the decrease was primarily driven by higher costs and lower volumes due to hurricane harvey as well as lower margins these items were partially offset by lower impairment charges higher equity in earnings from an op affiliate due to lower turnaround costs and a gain on the sale of cpchem’s kresin ®  styrenebutadiene copolymers business cpchem recognized impairment charges of 127 million and 177 million in 2017 and 2016 respectively due to lower demand and margin factors as a result of these impairments net income of the chemicals segment was reduced by 39 million and 89 million in 2017 and 2016 respectively 

as a result of hurricane harvey cpchem’s cedar bayou facility in baytown texas experienced severe flooding which caused it to shut down operations in the third quarter of 2017 this facility restarted in phases during the fourth quarter of 2017 cpchem’s us gulf coast petrochemicals project which consists of an ethane cracker at cedar bayou and two polyethylene units at old ocean texas was also impacted by the flooding cpchem achieved mechanical completion of its ethane cracker at the cedar bayou facility in december 2017 and is expected to complete commissioning of the ethane cracker in the first quarter of 2018 with a transition to full production in the second quarter of 2018

index to financial statements 

2016  vs 2015 

net income from the chemicals segment decreased 379 million in 2016 compared with 2015 the decrease in net income was primarily due to lower realized margins from the op business driven by a decline in sales prices for polyethylene and normal alpha olefins nao and higher feedstock costs as well as impacts from increased turnaround activity lower equity earnings from cpchem’s equity affiliates and lower sas volumes further reduced net income in 2016 

in addition cpchem recognized a 177 million impairment in 2016 due to lower demand and margin factors affecting an equity affiliate which resulted in an 89 million aftertax reduction in our equity earnings from cpchem our equity in earnings from cpchem were reduced by 24 million in 2015 as a result of an impairment cpchem recognized on an equity affiliate these items were partially offset by higher nao and polyethylene sales volumes and improved sas margins 

refining 

  



index to financial statements 



the refining segment refines crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products such as gasoline distillates and aviation fuels at 13  refineries in the united states and europe 

2017  vs 2016   

net income for the refining segment increased   1030 million  in 2017  compared with 2016  the increase was primarily due to higher realized refining margins and west coast volumes as well as an aftertax gain of 261 million  recognized on the consolidation of mslp partially offset by higher turnaround expenses utilities costs and pension settlement expense the higher realized refining margins primarily resulted from improved market crack spreads and secondary product margins partially offset by lower feedstock advantage 

see the “business environment and executive overview” section for information on industry crack spreads and other market factors impacting this year’s results in addition see note 5—business combinations  and note 27— phillips 66 partners lp  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the consolidation of mslp in february 2017 and the subsequent contribution of our ownership interest in mslp to phillips 66 partners in october 2017 respectively 

our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 95 percent  in 2017  compared with 96 percent  in 2016  the decrease was primarily attributable to higher turnaround activities and unplanned downtime partially offset by improved market conditions 

index to financial statements 

2016  vs 2015   

net income for the refining segment decreased 2181 million in 2016  compared with 2015 lower net income in 2016 reflected lower realized refining margins resulting from decreased market crack spreads higher costs associated with renewable fuels blending activities lower clean product differentials and lower feedstock advantage these items were partially offset by higher volumes due to lower turnaround activities and less unplanned downtime 

our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 96 percent  in 2016  compared with 91 percent  in 2015  the increase was primarily attributable to lower turnaround activities and less unplanned downtime 

nongaap reconciliations 

our realized refining margins measure the difference between a sales and other operating revenues derived from the sale of petroleum products manufactured at our refineries and b purchase costs of feedstocks primarily crude oil used to produce the petroleum products the margins are adjusted to include our proportional share of our jointventure refineries’ realized margins as well as to exclude those items that are not representative of the underlying operating performance of a period which we call “special items” the realized refining margins are converted to a perbarrel basis by dividing them by total refinery processed inputs primarily crude oil measured on a barrel basis including our share of inputs processed by our jointventure refineries our realized refining margin per barrel is intended to be comparable with industry refining margins which are known as “crack spreads” as discussed in “business environment” industry crack spreads measure the difference between market prices for refined petroleum products and crude oil realized refining margin per barrel calculated on a similar basis as industry crack spreads provides a useful measure of how well we performed relative to benchmark industry margins 

under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap the performance measure most directly comparable to refining margin per barrel is the refining segment’s “net income per barrel” refining margin per barrel excludes items that are typically included in a manufacturer’s gross margin such as depreciation and operating expenses and other items used to determine net income such as general and administrative expenses and income taxes it also includes our proportional share of jointventure refineries’ realized margins and excludes special items because refining margin per barrel is calculated in this manner and because refining margin per barrel may be defined differently by other companies in our industry it has limitations as an analytical tool following are reconciliations of net income to realized refining margins

marketing and specialties 

  



the ms segment purchases for resale and markets refined petroleum products such as gasoline distillates and aviation fuels mainly in the united states and europe in addition this segment includes the manufacturing and marketing of specialty products such as base oils and lubricants as well as power generation operations 

2017  vs 2016   

net income from the ms segment decreased   205 million  in 2017  compared with 2016  the decrease was primarily due to lower realized marketing margins as well as the absence of biofuel tax credits and a favorable income tax adjustment recognized in 2016 

see the “business environment and executive overview” section for information on marketing fuel margins and other market factors impacting 2016 results 

2016  vs 2015 

net income from the ms segment decreased 296 million in 2016 compared with 2015 the decrease was mainly attributable to the 242 million deferred gain recognized in 2015 related to the 2013 ichp sale see note 6—assets held for sale or sold  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

index to financial statements 

also contributing to the lower net income in 2016 were lower realized marketing margins driven by an upward trend of spot prices during most of 2016 and lower margins and volumes in lubricants these decreases were partially offset by favorable tax adjustments and higher marketing volumes 

nongaap reconciliations 

our realized marketing fuel margins measure the difference between a sales and other operating revenues derived from the sale of fuels in our ms segment and b purchase costs of those fuels these margins are converted to a perbarrel basis by dividing them by sales volumes measured on a barrel basis marketing fuel margin per barrel demonstrates the value uplift our marketing operations provide by optimizing the placement and ultimate sale of our refineries’ fuel production 

  

within the ms segment the gaap performance measure most directly comparable to marketing fuel margin per barrel is the marketing business’ “net income per barrel” marketing fuel margin per barrel excludes items that are typically included in gross margin such as depreciation and operating expenses and other items used to determine net income such as general and administrative expenses and income taxes because marketing fuel margin per barrel excludes these items and because marketing fuel margin per barrel may be defined differently by other companies in our industry it has limitations as an analytical tool following are reconciliations of net income to realized marketing fuel margins

corporate and other 

  



2017  vs 2016 

net interest expense consists of interest and financing expense net of interest income and capitalized interest net interest expense increased   56 million  in 2017  compared with 2016  primarily due to lower capitalized interest as a result of the freeport lpg export terminal beginning operations in late 2016 and higher interest expense driven by higher average debt principal balances reflecting phillips 66 partners’ debt issuances in october 2017 and 2016 

the tax act was enacted on december 22 2017 the material provisions of the tax act i reduced the us federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent  to 21 percent  beginning january 1 2018 ii imposed a onetime deemed repatriation tax on foreignsourced earnings that were previously tax deferred and iii created a new tax regime on post2017 foreignsourced earnings we have not yet completed our accounting for the income tax effects of the tax act as of december 31 2017  but have made reasonable estimates of those effects on our existing deferred income tax balances and the onetime deemed repatriation tax we recognized a provisional income tax benefit of 2735 million  which is included in the “income tax expense benefit” line on our consolidated statement of income we have included these onetime impacts of the tax act in corporate and other of the provisional income tax benefit recognized 2870 million  was associated with the revaluation of our existing deferred tax assets and liabilities and 14 million  reflected higher manufacturing deductions which was an indirect benefit of the tax act these benefits were partially offset by the onetime deemed repatriation tax estimate of 149 million  we expect the tax act to significantly lower our effective tax rates in 2018 and future years for both our consolidated operations and each of our operating segments see note 21—income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 

2016  vs 2015 

net interest expense increased 24 million in 2016 compared with 2015 mainly due to lower capitalized interest 

the category “other” includes certain income tax expenses environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation foreign currency transaction gains and losses and other costs not directly associated with an operating segment the decrease in other costs in 2016 was primarily attributable to favorable tax impacts and the writeoff of certain fixed assets during 2015 partially offset by higher environmental accruals

capital resources and liquidity 

financial indicators 



to meet our short and longterm liquidity requirements we look to a variety of funding sources but rely primarily on cash generated from operating activities additionally phillips 66 partners raises funds for its growth activities through debt and equity financings during 2017  we generated 36 billion  in cash from operations phillips 66 partners completed the private placement of perpetual convertible preferred units and common units and the public offering of senior notes and common units for net proceeds totaling 18 billion  we used this available cash primarily for capital expenditures and investments of 18 billion  repurchases of our common stock of 16 billion  and dividend payments on our common stock of 14 billion  during 2017  cash and cash equivalents increased  by 04 billion  to 31 billion  

in addition to cash flows from operating activities we rely on our commercial paper and credit facility programs asset sales and our ability to issue securities using our shelf registration statement to support our short and longterm liquidity requirements we believe current cash and cash equivalents and cash generated by operations together with access to external sources of funds as described below under “significant sources of capital” will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near and long term including our capital spending dividend payments defined benefit plan contributions debt repayment and share repurchases 

significant sources of capital 

operating activities 

during 2017  cash of  3648 million  was provided by operating activities a 23 percent   increase  compared with 2016  the increase was primarily attributable to increased operating results due to higher realized refining margins and distributions from our equity affiliates this increase was partially offset by working capital changes reflecting the negative impact of building inventory at higher commodity prices and timing of refining payables payments as well as lower marketing margins 

during 2016  cash of  2963 million  was provided by operating activities a 48 percent decrease compared with 2015 the decrease was primarily attributable to lower realized refining margins as well as a reduction in distributions from our equity affiliates this decrease was partially offset by positive working capital of 501 million in 2016 compared to a negative working capital impact of 221 million in 2015 the positive working capital impact in 2016 was primarily driven by increased refining payables due to an increase in feedstock costs at the end of 2016 as compared with 2015 and the timing of tax payments and refunds partially offset by an increase in receivables resulting from higher commodity prices 

our short and longterm operating cash flows are highly dependent upon refining and marketing margins ngl prices and chemicals margins prices and margins in our industry are typically volatile and are driven by market conditions over which we have little or no control absent other mitigating factors as these prices and margins fluctuate we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows 

index to financial statements 

the level and quality of output from our refineries also impacts our cash flows factors such as operating efficiency maintenance turnarounds market conditions feedstock availability and weather conditions can affect output we actively manage the operations of our refineries and any variability in their operations typically has not been as significant to cash flows as that caused by margins and prices our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization was 95 percent  in 2017  compared with 96 percent  in 2016  

equity affiliates 

our operating cash flows are also impacted by distribution decisions made by our equity affiliates including dcp midstream cpchem and wrb over the three years ended december 31 2017  we received distributions of 107 million  from dcp midstream 1854 million  from cpchem and  300 million  from wrb we cannot control the amount or timing of future distributions from equity affiliates therefore future distributions by these and other equity affiliates are not assured 

effective january 1 2017 dcp midstream and dcp partners closed a transaction in which dcp midstream contributed subsidiaries owning all of its operating assets 424 million  of cash and 315 billion  of debt to dcp partners in exchange for dcp partners units which had an estimated fair value of 1125 billion  at the time of the transaction we and our coventurer retained our 5050 investment in dcp midstream and dcp midstream retained its incentive distribution rights idrs in dcp partners through its ownership of the general partner of dcp partners after the transaction dcp midstream held a 36 percent  limited partner interest and a 2 percent general partner interest in dcp partners dcp midstream through its ownership of the general partner has agreed if required to forgo receipt of idrs up to 100 million  annually 100 percent basis through 2019 to support a minimum distribution coverage ratio for dcp partners in connection with the transaction dcp midstream terminated its revolving credit agreement which had previously served to limit distributions to its owners while amounts had been borrowed under the facility as a result distributions to the owners of dcp midstream resumed in 2017 

in 2015 cpchem made a special distribution to its owners with our share totaling 696 million cpchem funded the distribution by issuing 14 billion of senior notes with maturities ranging from three to five years with a combination of fixed and floating interest rates this cash inflow from cpchem was included in operating cash flows as we had cumulative undistributed equity earnings attributable to cpchem in excess of the amount distributed we did not receive any distributions from cpchem in the second half of 2017 due to the impacts of hurricane harvey on its gulf coast operations and its us gulf coast petrochemicals project we expect distributions from cpchem to resume in 2018 

foreign cash holdings 

with the passage of the tax act in december 2017 we are subject to a onetime deemed repatriation tax on foreignsourced earnings for a portion of those foreign earnings we had previously deferred any associated us income taxes as a result of the tax act we now have the ability to utilize a greater percentage of our worldwide cash and cash equivalents for domestic purposes without incurring additional material us income taxes beyond those imposed by the onetime deemed repatriation tax thereby improving the flexibility of our worldwide cash management system we expect a portion of our foreign cash holdings will be reserved exclusively for foreign use in support of those operations and local statutory and regulatory requirements however that amount is not expected to materially impact our liquidity additionally we do not expect the payment of the onetime deemed repatriation tax to materially impact our liquidity 

phillips 66 partners 

in 2013 we formed phillips 66 partners a publicly traded mlp to own operate develop and acquire primarily feebased crude oil refined petroleum products and ngl pipelines and terminals as well as other midstream assets

other debt issuances and financings 

in april 2017 phillips 66 completed a private offering of 600 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes consisting of 300 million of notes due 2019 and 300 million of notes due 2020 interest on the notes is a floating rate equal to threemonth libor plus 065 per annum for the 2019 notes and threemonth libor plus 075 per annum for the 2020 notes interest on both series of notes is payable quarterly in arrears on january 15 april 15 july 15 and october 15 commencing in july 2017 the 2019 notes mature on april 15 2019 and the 2020 notes mature on april 15 2020 

also in april 2017 phillips 66 entered into term loan facilities with an aggregate borrowing amount of 900 million consisting of a 450 million 364day facility and a 450 million threeyear facility interest on the term loans is a floating rate based on either the eurodollar rate or the reference rate plus a margin determined by our longterm credit ratings 

phillips 66 used the net proceeds from the issuance of the notes together with the proceeds from the term loans and cash onhand to repay its outstanding 2950 senior notes upon maturity in may 2017 

in october 2017 as part of the contribution of assets to phillips 66 partners discussed above phillips 66 partners assumed the 450 million term loan outstanding under the 364day facility originally issued in april 2017 and subsequently repaid the loan 

in addition we have   capital lease obligations related to equipment and transportation assets and the use of an oil terminal in the united kingdom these leases mature within the next sixteen years the present value of our minimum capital lease payments for these obligations as of december 31 2017  was 192 million  

availability of debt and equity financing 

the 60 billion  of outstanding senior notes and 600 million of floatingrate notes issued by phillips 66 are guaranteed by phillips 66 company a 100percentowned subsidiary our senior unsecured longterm debt has been rated investment grade by sp bbb and moody’s a3 we do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default and thereby impact our access to liquidity in the event of a downgrade of our credit rating if our credit rating deteriorated to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market we would expect to be able to access funds under our liquidity facilities mentioned above

contingencies 

a number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims that arose in the ordinary course of business have been filed against us or are subject to indemnifications provided by us we also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement storage disposal or release of certain chemical mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites we regularly assess the need for financial recognition or disclosure of these contingencies in the case of all known contingencies other than those related to income taxes we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable if a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount then the minimum of the range is accrued we do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or thirdparty recoveries if applicable we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other thirdparty recoveries in the case of incometaxrelated contingencies we use a cumulative probabilityweighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain 

based on currently available information we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements as we learn new facts concerning contingencies we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include contingent liabilities recorded for environmental remediation tax and legal matters estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other potentially responsible parties estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes 

legal and tax matters 

our legal and tax matters are handled by our legal and tax organizations these organizations apply their knowledge experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases and uncertain tax positions we employ a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases and enables the tracking of those cases that have been scheduled for trial andor mediation based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals or establishment of new accruals is required in the case of incometaxrelated contingencies we monitor tax legislation and court decisions the status of tax audits and the statute of limitations within which a taxing authority can assert a liability see note 21—income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about incometaxrelated contingencies 

environmental 

like other companies in our industry we are subject to numerous international federal state and local environmental laws and regulations among the most significant of these international and federal environmental laws and regulations are the 

  



index to financial statements 

 these laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and in the case of discharges to water establish water quality limits they also in most cases require permits in association with new or modified operations these permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process which can be expensive and time consuming in addition there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency’s processing of the application many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant 

many states and foreign countries where we operate also have or are developing similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities while similar in some cases these regulations may impose additional or more stringent requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of developing infrastructure and marketing and transporting products across state and international borders for example in california the south coast air quality management district scaqmd approved amendments to the regional clean air incentives market reclaim that became effective in 2016 which require a phased reduction of nitrogen oxide emissions through 2022 and potentially affect refineries in the los angeles metropolitan area in 2017 scaqmd required additional nitrogen dioxide emissions reductions through 2025 and began evaluating if and how to replace the reclaim program with a traditional command and controls regulatory regime 

the ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards such as air emission standards water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations continue to evolve however environmental laws and regulations including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the united states and in other countries in which we operate notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the united states 

an example of this in the fuels area is the energy independence and security act of 2007 eisa it requires fuel producers and importers to provide additional renewable fuels for transportation motor fuels and stipulates a mix of various types to be included through 2022 we have met the increasingly stringent requirements to date while establishing implementation operating and capital strategies along with advanced technology development to address projected future requirements it is uncertain how various future requirements contained in eisa and the regulations promulgated thereunder may be implemented and what their full impact may be on our operations for the 2018 compliance year the epa has set volumes of advanced and total renewable fuel at higher levels than mandated in most previous years although the 2018 compliance year volumes are roughly equivalent to those required for the 2017 compliance year it is uncertain if these increased obligations will be achievable by fuel producers and shippers without drawing on the renewable identification number rin bank for compliance years after 2018 we do not know whether the epa will utilize its authority to reduce statutory volumes additionally we may experience a decrease in demand for refined petroleum products due to the regulatory program as currently promulgated this program continues to be the subject of possible congressional review and repromulgation in revised form and the epa’s regulations pertaining to the 2014 through 2017 compliance years are subject to legal challenge further creating uncertainty regarding renewable fuel volume requirements and obligations additionally the market for rins has been the subject of fraudulent thirdparty activity and it is reasonably possible that some rins that we have purchased may be determined to be invalid should that occur we could incur costs to replace those fraudulent rins although the cost for replacing any fraudulently marketed rins is not reasonably estimable at this time we would not expect to incur the full financial impact of fraudulent rins replacement costs in any single interim or annual period and would not expect such costs to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

we also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations such laws and regulations include cercla and rcra and their state equivalents remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility arising from petroleum releases from underground storage tanks located at numerous previously and currently owned andor operated petroleummarketing outlets throughout the united 

index to financial statements 

states federal and state laws require contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards in addition to other cleanup standards many states have adopted cleanup criteria for methyl tertiarybutyl ether for both soil and groundwater 

at rcrapermitted facilities we are required to assess environmental conditions if conditions warrant we may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations in contrast to cercla which is often referred to as “superfund” the cost of corrective action activities under rcra corrective action programs typically is borne solely by us we anticipate increased expenditures for rcra remediation activities may be required but such annual expenditures for the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures we have experienced over the past few years longerterm expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly 

we occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the epa and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under cercla or an equivalent state statute on occasion we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties these requests notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations as of december 31 2016  we reported that we had been notified of potential liability under cercla and comparable state laws at 31  sites within the united states during 2017  there were three  new sites for which we received notification of potential liability and three  sites were deemed resolved and closed leaving 31  unresolved sites with potential liability at december 31 2017  

for most superfund sites our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties is relatively low although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations and where they have not or where potentially responsible parties could not be located our share of liability has not increased materially many of the sites for which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the epa or the state agencies concerned prior to actual cleanup those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation in some instances we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain epa or equivalent state agency approval of a remediation plan there are relatively few sites where we are a major participant and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all cercla sites in the aggregate is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition 

expensed environmental costs were 690 million  in 2017  and are expected to be approximately 670 million  and 640 million  in 2018  and 2019  respectively capitalized environmental costs were 159 million  in 2017  and are expected to be approximately 185 million  and 135 million  in 2018  and 2019  respectively this amount does not include capital expenditures made for another purpose that have an indirect benefit on environmental compliance 

accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted except those assumed in a business combination which we record on a discounted basis 

many of these liabilities result from cercla rcra and similar state laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct or once conducted operations or at sites where our generated waste was disposed we also have accrued for a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation but which are not currently the subject of cercla rcra or state enforcement activities if applicable we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other thirdparty recoveries in the future we may incur significant costs under both cercla and rcra remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site depending on the mix of unique site characteristics evolving remediation technologies diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties therefore it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs 

notwithstanding any of the foregoing and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in certain of our operations and products and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred however we currently do not expect any material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations

climate change 

there has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state national and international laws focusing on greenhouse gas ghg emissions reduction including various regulations proposed or issued by the epa these proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in states andor countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future laws regulating ghg emissions continue to evolve and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation such laws potentially could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition as a result of increasing costs of compliance lengthening project implementation and agency review items or reducing demand for certain hydrocarbon products examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include 

  

 

in the eu the first phase of the eu ets completed at the end of 2007 and phase ii was undertaken from 2008 through to 2012 the current phase phase iii runs from 2013 through to 2020 with the main changes being reduced allocation of free allowances and increased auctioning of new allowances phillips 66 has assets that are subject to the eu ets and the company is actively engaged in minimizing any financial impact from the eu ets 

from november 30 to december 12 2015 more than 190 countries including the united states participated in the united nations climate change conference in paris france the conference culminated in what is known as the “paris agreement” which upon certain conditions being met entered into force on november 4 2016 the paris agreement establishes a commitment by signatory parties to pursue domestic ghg emission reductions in 2017 the president of the united states announced his intention to withdraw the united states from the paris agreement 

in the united states some additional form of regulation is likely to be forthcoming in the future at the state or federal levels with respect to ghg emissions such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes the restriction of output investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances we are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations 

compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a ghg emission trading program ghg reduction requirements or carbon taxes could significantly increase our costs reduce demand for fossil energy derived products impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources 

index to financial statements 

an example of one such program is california’s cap and trade program which was promulgated pursuant to the state’s global warming solutions act the program had been limited to certain stationary sources which include our refineries in california but beginning in january 2015 expanded to include emissions from transportation fuels distributed in california inclusion of transportation fuels in california’s cap and trade program as currently promulgated has increased our cap and trade program compliance costs the ultimate impact on our financial performance either positive or negative from this and similar programs will depend on a number of factors including but not limited to 

  

 

we consider and take into account anticipated future ghg emissions in designing and developing major facilities and projects and implement energy efficiency initiatives to reduce ghg emissions data on our ghg emissions legal requirements regulating such emissions and the possible physical effects of climate change on our coastal assets are incorporated into our planning investment and risk management decisionmaking

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses see note 1—summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for descriptions of our major accounting policies certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions or if different assumptions had been used the following discussion of critical accounting estimates along with the discussion of contingencies in this report address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions could be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change 

impairments 

longlived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows is expected if the sum of the undiscounted pretax cash flows of an asset group is less than the carrying value including applicable liabilities the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets for example at a refinery complex level because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for longlived assets the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined using one or more of the following methods the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants a market multiple of earnings for similar assets or historical market transactions of similar assets adjusted using principal market participant assumptions when necessary the expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future volumes commodity prices operating costs margins discount rates and capital project decisions considering all available information at the date of review 

investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are assessed for impairment when there are indicators of a loss in value such as a lack of sustained earnings capacity or a current fair value less than the investment’s carrying amount when it is determined that an indicated impairment is other than temporary a charge is recognized for the difference between the investment’s carrying value and its estimated fair value 

when determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline the investee’s financial condition and nearterm prospects and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that allows for recovery when quoted market prices are not available the fair value is usually based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants and a market analysis of comparable assets if appropriate differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period 

asset retirement obligations 

under various contracts permits and regulations we have legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land at the end of operations at certain operational sites our largest asset removal obligations involve asbestos abatement at refineries estimating the timing and amount of payments for future asset removal costs is difficult most of these removal obligations are many years or decades in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs asset removal technologies and costs regulatory and other compliance considerations expenditure timing and other inputs into valuation of the obligation including discount and inflation rates are also subject to change 

environmental costs 

in addition to asset retirement obligations discussed above we have certain obligations to complete environmentalrelated projects these projects are primarily related to cleanup at domestic refineries underground storage sites and nonoperated sites future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs timing and extent of such remedial actions that may be required and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties 

index to financial statements 

intangible assets and goodwill 

at december 31 2017  we had 756 million  of intangible assets that we have determined to have indefinite useful lives and therefore are not amortized this judgmental assessment of an indefinite useful life must be continuously evaluated in the future if due to changes in facts and circumstances management determines these intangible assets have finite useful lives amortization will commence at that time on a prospective basis as long as these intangible assets are judged to have indefinite lives they will be subject to annual impairment tests that require management’s judgment of the estimated fair value of these intangible assets 

at december 31 2017  we had 33 billion  of goodwill recorded in conjunction with past business combinations goodwill is not amortized instead goodwill is subject to at least annual reviews for impairment at a reporting unit level the reporting units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed a reporting unit is an operating segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment 

because quoted market prices for our reporting units are not available management applies judgment in determining the estimated fair values of the reporting units for purposes of performing the goodwill impairment test management uses all available information to make this fair value determination including observed market earnings multiples of comparable companies our common stock price and associated total company market capitalization sales or dispositions of significant assets within a reporting unit are allocated a portion of that reporting unit’s goodwill based on relative fair values which impacts the amount of gain or loss on the sale or disposition 

we completed our annual impairment test as of october 1 2017 and concluded that the fair value of each of our reporting units continued to exceed their respective recorded net book values by a significant percentage a decline in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units in the future could result in an impairment for example a prolonged or significant decline in our stock price or a significant decline in actual or forecasted earnings could provide evidence of a significant decline in fair value and a need to record a material impairment of goodwill for one or more of our reporting units after we have completed our annual test we continue to monitor for impairment indicators which can lead to further goodwill impairment testing

our operations are subject to various taxes including federal state and foreign income taxes property taxes and transactional taxes such as excise salesuse and payroll taxes we record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations the recording of tax liabilities requires significant judgment and estimates we recognize the financial statement effects of an income tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority a contingent liability related to a transactional tax claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and estimable actual incurred tax liabilities can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons including different interpretations of tax laws and regulations and different assessments of the amount of tax due 

in determining our income tax expense benefit we assess the likelihood our deferred tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income valuation allowances reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized judgment is required in estimating the amount of valuation allowance if any that should be recorded against our deferred tax assets based on our historical taxable income our expectations for the future and available taxplanning strategies we expect the net deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as reductions to future taxable income if our actual results of operations differ from such estimates or our estimates of future taxable income change the valuation allowance may need to be revised 

new tax laws and regulations as well as changes to existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being proposed or promulgated the implementation of future legislative and regulatory tax initiatives could result in increased income tax liabilities that cannot be predicted at this time the material provisions of the tax act i reduced the us federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent beginning january 1 2018 ii imposed a onetime deemed repatriation tax on foreignsourced earnings that were previously tax deferred and iii created a new tax regime on post2017 foreignsourced earnings we have not yet completed our accounting for the income tax effects of the tax act as of december 31 2017 but have made reasonable estimates of those effects on our existing deferred income tax balances and the onetime deemed repatriation tax as more guidelines and interpretations of the tax act become available over the next year the estimates previously made may change which could increase or decrease our revalued deferred income tax balances and the onetime deemed repatriation tax with an offset to earnings

projected benefit obligations 

determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans impacts the obligations on the balance sheet and the amount of benefit expense in the income statement the actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events including estimated retirement dates salary levels at retirement mortality rates lumpsum election rates rates of return on plan assets future interest rates future health care costtrend rates and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees due to the specialized nature of these calculations we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects ultimately we will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions a one percentagepoint decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by an estimated 65 million while a one percentagepoint decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by an estimated 35 million in determining the discount rate we use yields on highquality fixed income investments with payments matched to the estimated distributions of benefits from our plans 

in 2017 and 2016 our expected weightedaverage longterm rate of return was approximately 6 percent for our worldwide pension plan assets the actual weightedaverage rate of return was 15 percent and 10 percent in 2017 and 2016 respectively for the past ten years our weightedaverage actual rate of return was 7 percent for worldwide pension plan assets 

new accounting standards 

in february 2017 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201705 “other income—gains and losses from the derecognition of nonfinancial assets subtopic 61020” this asu clarifies the scope and accounting for the sale or transfer of nonfinancial assets and in substance nonfinancial assets to noncustomers including partial sales this asu will eliminate the use of carryover basis for most nonmonetary exchanges including contributions of assets to equity method joint ventures these amendments could result in the entity recognizing a gain or loss on the sale or transfer of nonfinancial assets public entities should apply the guidance in asu no 201705 to annual periods beginning after december 15 2017 including interim periods within those periods there was no impact on our financial statements from adopting this asu on january 1 2018 

in january 2017 the fasb issued asu no 201701 “business combinations topic 805 clarifying the definition of a business” which clarifies the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist in evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions of assets or businesses the amendment provides a screen for determining when a transaction involves an acquisition of a business if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets then the transaction is not considered an acquisition of a business if the screen is not met then the amendment requires that to be considered a business the operation must include at a minimum an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create an output the guidance may reduce the number of transactions accounted for as business acquisitions public business entities should apply the guidance in asu no 201701 to annual periods beginning after december 15 2017 including interim periods within those periods with early adoption permitted the amendments should be applied prospectively and no disclosures are required at the effective date there was no impact on our financial statements from adopting this asu on january 1 2018 

in june 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201613 “financial instruments—credit losses topic 326 measurement of credit losses on financial instruments” the new standard amends the impairment model to utilize an expected loss methodology in place of the currently used incurred loss methodology which may result in earlier recognition of losses public business entities should apply the guidance in asu no 201613 for annual periods beginning after december 15 2019 including interim periods within those annual periods early adoption will be permitted for annual periods beginning after december 15 2018 we are currently evaluating the provisions of asu no 201613 and assessing the impact on our financial statements

in february 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201602 “leases topic 842” the new standard establishes a rightofuse rou model that requires a lessee to record a rou asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months leases will continue to be classified as either finance or operating with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement similarly lessors will be required to classify leases as salestype finance or operating with classification affecting the pattern of income recognition classification for both lessees and lessors will be based on an assessment of whether risks and rewards as well as substantive control have been transferred through a lease contract public business entities should apply the guidance in asu no 201602 for annual periods beginning after december 15 2018 including interim periods within those annual periods early adoption is permitted entities are required to adopt the asu using a modified retrospective approach subject to certain optional practical expedients and apply the provisions of asu no 201602 to leasing arrangements existing at or entered into after the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements we are currently evaluating the provisions of asu no 201602 and assessing its impact on our financial statements as part of our assessment todate we have formed an implementation team commenced identification of our lease population and selected a lease software package we expect the adoption of asu 201602 will materially gross up our consolidated balance sheet with the recognition of the rou assets and operating lease liabilities the impact to our consolidated statements of income and cash flows is not expected to be material the new standard will also require additional disclosures for financing and operating leases 

in january 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201601 “financial instruments—overall subtopic 82510 recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities” to meet its objective of providing more decisionuseful information about financial instruments the majority of this asu’s provisions amend only the presentation or disclosures of financial instruments however one provision will also affect net income equity investments carried under the cost method or lower of cost or fair value method of accounting in accordance with current gaap will have to be carried at fair value upon adoption of asu no 201601 with changes in fair value recorded in net income for equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values a company may elect to carry such investments at cost less impairments if any adjusted up or down for price changes in similar financial instruments issued by the investee when and if observed public business entities should apply the guidance in asu no 201601 for annual periods beginning after december 15 2017 and interim periods within those annual periods with early adoption prohibited we are currently evaluating the provisions of asu no 201601 our initial review indicates that asu no 201601 will have a limited impact on our financial statements 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers topic 606” this asu and other related updates are intended to improve comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities industries jurisdictions and capital markets and expand disclosure requirements in august 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201514 “revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 deferral of the effective date” the amendment in this asu defers the effective date of asu no 201409 for all entities for one year public business entities should apply the guidance in asu no 201409 to annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 including interim reporting periods within that reporting period our assessment work primarily included the formation of an implementation work team training on the new asu’s revenue recognition model contract review and documentation and the monitoring of industry interpretative issues we adopted the standard on january 1 2018 using the modified retrospective application our evaluation of the new asu is near completion which includes understanding the impact of adoption on earnings from equity method investments based upon our analysis todate the primary impact of adoption of the new standard is the netting of salesbased taxes collected from our customers against revenue salesbased taxes include excise taxes on sales of petroleum products as noted on our consolidated statement of income we have not identified any other material impact on our financial statements other than disclosures

financial instrument market risk 

we and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose our cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates we may use financial and commoditybased derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of crude oil and related products natural gas ngl and electric power fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates or to capture market opportunities 

our use of derivative instruments is governed by an “authority limitations” document approved by our board of directors that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient market liquidity for comparable valuations the authority limitations document also establishes value at risk var limits and compliance with these limits is monitored daily our chief financial officer monitors risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates our executive vice president marketing and commercial monitors commodity price risk the commercial organization manages our commercial marketing optimizes our commodity flows and positions and monitors related risks of our businesses 

commodity price risk 

we sell into or receive supply from the worldwide crude oil refined products natural gas ngl and electric power markets exposing our revenues purchases cost of operating activities and cash flows to fluctuations in the prices for these commodities generally our policy is to remain exposed to the market prices of commodities consistent with this policy our commercial organization uses derivative contracts to effectively convert our exposure from fixedprice sales contracts often requested by refined product customers back to fluctuating market prices conversely our commercial organization also uses futures forwards swaps and options in various markets to accomplish the following objectives to optimize the value of our supply chain and this may reduce our exposure to fluctuations in market prices 

 

we use a var model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments held or issued including commodity purchase and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at december 31 2017  as derivative instruments using the monte carlo simulation a 95 percent confidence level and a oneday holding period the var for those instruments issued or held for trading purposes at december 31 2017  and 2016  was immaterial to our cash flows and net income the var for instruments held for purposes other than trading at december 31 2017  and 2016  was also immaterial to our cash flows and net income

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form 10k each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition as well as affect the value of an investment in our common stock 

our operating results and future rate of growth are exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices and refining marketing and petrochemical margins 

our revenues operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent on a number of factors including fixed and variable expenses including the cost of crude oil ngl and other refining and petrochemical feedstocks and the margin we can derive from selling refined and chemicals segment products the prices of feedstocks and our products fluctuate substantially these prices depend on numerous factors beyond our control including the global supply and demand for feedstocks and our products which are subject to among other things 

  

 

the price of crude oil influences prices for refined products we do not produce crude oil and must purchase all of the crude oil we process many crude oils available on the world market will not meet the quality restrictions for use in our refineries others are not economical to use due to excessive transportation costs or for other reasons the prices for crude oil and refined products can fluctuate differently based on global regional and local market conditions in addition the timing of the relative movement of the prices both among different classes of refined products and among various global markets for similar refined products as well as the overall change in refined product prices can reduce refining margins and could have a significant impact on our refining wholesale marketing and retail operations revenues operating income and cash flows also crude oil supply contracts generally have marketresponsive pricing provisions we normally purchase our refinery feedstocks weeks before manufacturing and selling the refined products changes in prices that occur between when we purchase feedstocks and when we sell the refined products produced from these feedstocks could have a significant effect on our financial results we also purchase refined products produced by others for sale to our customers price changes that occur between when we purchase and sell these refined products also could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the price of feedstocks also influences prices for petrochemical and plastics products although our chemicals segment gathers transports and fractionates feedstocks to meet a portion of their demand and has certain longterm feedstock supply contracts with others it is still subject to volatile feedstock prices in addition the petrochemicals industry is both cyclical and volatile cyclicality occurs when periods of tight supply resulting in increased prices and profit margins are followed by periods of capacity expansion resulting in oversupply and declining prices and profit margins volatility occurs as a result of changes in supply and demand for products changes in energy prices and changes in various other economic conditions around the world 

uncertainty and illiquidity in credit and capital markets can impair our ability to obtain credit and financing on acceptable terms and can adversely affect the financial strength of our business partners 

our ability to obtain credit and capital depends in large measure on the state of the credit and capital markets which is beyond our control our ability to access credit and capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like or need access to those markets which could constrain our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions in addition the cost and availability of debt and equity financing may be adversely impacted by unstable or illiquid market conditions protracted uncertainty and illiquidity in these markets also could have an adverse impact on our lenders commodity hedging counterparties or our customers preventing them from meeting their obligations to us 

index to financial statements 

from time to time our cash needs may exceed our internally generated cash flow and our business could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to obtain necessary funds from financing activities from time to time we may need to supplement cash generated from operations with proceeds from financing activities uncertainty and illiquidity in financial markets may materially impact the ability of the participating financial institutions to fund their commitments to us under our liquidity facilities accordingly we may not be able to obtain the full amount of the funds available under our liquidity facilities to satisfy our cash requirements and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position 

deterioration in our credit profile could increase our costs of borrowing money and limit our access to the capital markets and commercial credit and could trigger coventurer rights under joint venture arrangements 

our or phillips 66 partners’ credit ratings could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment the circumstances warrant if a rating agency were to downgrade our rating below investment grade our or phillips 66 partners’ borrowing costs would increase and our funding sources could decrease in addition a failure by us to maintain an investment grade rating could affect our business relationships with suppliers and operating partners for example our agreement with chevron regarding cpchem permits chevron to buy our 50 percent interest in cpchem for fair market value if we experience a change in control or if both sp and moody’s lower our credit ratings below investment grade and the credit rating from either rating agency remains below investment grade for 365 days thereafter with fair market value determined by agreement or by nationally recognized investment banks as a result of these factors a downgrade of credit ratings could have a materially adverse impact on our future operations and financial position 

we expect to continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of our compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations likewise future environmental laws and regulations may impact or limit our current business plans and reduce demand for our products 

our business is subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment these laws and regulations continue to increase in both number and complexity and affect our operations with respect to among other things 

  

 

we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital operating and maintenance and remediation expenditures as a result of these laws and regulations to the extent these expenditures as with all costs are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in future periods could be materially adversely affected 

the us environmental protection agency epa has implemented a renewable fuel standard rfs pursuant to the energy policy act of 2005 and the energy independence and security act of 2007 the rfs program sets annual quotas for the quantity of renewable fuels such as ethanol that must be blended into motor fuels consumed in the united states to provide certain flexibility in compliance options available to the industry a renewable identification number rin is assigned to each gallon of renewable fuel produced in or imported into the united states as a producer of petroleumbased motor fuels we are obligated to blend renewable fuels into the products we produce at a rate that is at least commensurate to the epa’s quota and to the extent we do not we must purchase rins in the open market to satisfy our obligation under the rfs program to the extent the epa mandates a quantity of renewable fuel that exceeds the amount that is commercially feasible to blend into motor fuel a situation commonly referred to as “the blend wall” our operations could be materially adversely impacted up to and including a reduction in produced motor fuel 

index to financial statements 

the adoption of climate change legislation or regulation could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the refined products we produce 

the us government including the epa as well as several state and international governments have either considered or adopted legislation or regulations in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas ghg emissions these proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in states andor countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future in addition various groups suggest that additional laws may be needed in an effort to address climate change as illustrated by the paris agreement negotiated at the 2015 united nations conference on climate change referred to as cop 21 which entered into force on november 4 2016 we cannot predict the extent to which any such legislation or regulation will be enacted and if so what its provisions would be to the extent we incur additional costs required to comply with the adoption of new laws and regulations that are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in future periods could be materially adversely affected in addition demand for the refined products we produce could be adversely affected 

climate change may adversely affect our facilities and our ongoing operations 

the potential physical effects of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and depend upon the unique geographic and environmental factors present examples of such effects include rising sea levels at our coastal facilities changing storm patterns and intensities and changing temperature levels as many of our facilities are located near coastal areas rising sea levels may disrupt our ability to operate those facilities or transport crude oil and refined petroleum products extended periods of such disruption could have an adverse effect on our results of operation we could also incur substantial costs to protect or repair these facilities 

domestic and worldwide political and economic developments could affect our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows 

actions of the us state local and international governments through tax and other legislation or regulation executive order permit or other review of infrastructure or facility development and commercial restrictions could delay projects increase costs limit development or otherwise reduce our operating profitability both in the united states and abroad any such actions may affect many aspects of our operations including requiring permits or other approvals that may impose unforeseen or unduly burdensome conditions or potentially cause delays in our operations further limiting or prohibiting construction or other activities in environmentally sensitive or other areas requiring increased capital costs to construct maintain or upgrade equipment or facilities or restricting the locations where we may construct facilities or requiring the relocation of facilities in addition the us government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries these restrictions and those of foreign governments could limit our ability to operate in or gain access to opportunities in various countries as well as limit our ability to obtain the optimum slate of crude oil and other refinery feedstocks our foreign operations and those of our joint ventures are further subject to risks of loss of revenue equipment and property as a result of expropriation acts of terrorism war civil unrest and other political risks unilateral or forced renegotiation modification or nullification of existing contracts with governmental entities and difficulties enforcing rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations our foreign operations and those of our joint ventures are also subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates actions by both the united states and host governments may affect our operations significantly in the future 

renewable fuels alternative energy mandates and energy conservation efforts could reduce demand for refined products tax incentives and other subsidies can make renewable fuels and alternative energy more competitive with refined products than they otherwise might be which may reduce refined product margins and hinder the ability of refined products to compete with renewable fuels 

large capital projects can take many years to complete and market conditions could deteriorate significantly between the project approval date and the project startup date negatively impacting project returns 

we will not approve a largescale capital project unless we expect it will deliver an acceptable level of return on the capital invested in the project we base these forecasted project economics on our best estimate of future market conditions most largescale projects take several years to complete during this multiyear period market conditions can change from those we forecast and these changes could be significant accordingly we may not be able to realize 

index to financial statements 

our expected returns from a large investment in a capital project and this could negatively impact our results of operations cash flows and our return on capital employed 

our investments in joint ventures decrease our ability to manage risk 

we conduct some of our operations including parts of our midstream refining and ms segments and our entire chemicals segment through joint ventures in which we share control with our joint venture participants our joint venture participants may have economic business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with those of the joint venture or us or our joint venture participants may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone failure by us or an entity in which we have a jointventure interest to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisitions or joint ventures could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our joint ventures and in turn our business and operations 

activities in our chemicals and midstream segments involve numerous risks that may result in accidents or otherwise affect the ability of our equity affiliates to make distributions to us 

there are a variety of hazards and operating risks inherent in the manufacturing of petrochemicals and the gathering processing transmission storage and distribution of natural gas and ngl such as spills leaks explosions and mechanical problems that could cause substantial financial losses in addition these risks could result in significant injury loss of human life damage to property environmental pollution and impairment of operations any of which could result in substantial losses for assets located near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers industrial sites and other public gathering areas the level of damage resulting from these risks could be greater should any of these risks materialize it could have a material adverse effect on the business and financial condition of our equity affiliates in these segments and negatively impact their ability to make future distributions to us 

our operations present hazards and risks which may not be fully covered by insurance if insured if a significant accident or event occurs for which we are not adequately insured our operations and financial results could be adversely affected 

the scope and nature of our operations present a variety of operational hazards and risks including explosions fires toxic emissions maritime hazards and natural catastrophes that must be managed through continual oversight and control for example the operation of refineries power plants fractionators pipelines terminals and vessels is inherently subject to the risks of spills discharges or other inadvertent releases of petroleum or hazardous substances if any of these events had previously occurred or occurs in the future in connection with any of our refineries pipelines or refined products terminals or in connection with any facilities that receive our wastes or byproducts for treatment or disposal other than events for which we are indemnified we could be liable for all costs and penalties associated with their remediation under federal state local and international environmental laws or common law and could be liable for property damage to third parties caused by contamination from releases and spills these and other risks are present throughout our operations as protection against these hazards and risks we maintain insurance against many but not all potential losses or liabilities arising from such operating risks as such our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover us against potential losses arising from such risks uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating risks could reduce the funds available to us for capital and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to interruptions of supply and increased costs as a result of our reliance on thirdparty transportation of crude oil ngl and refined products 

we often utilize the services of third parties to transport crude oil ngl and refined products to and from our facilities in addition to our own operational risks discussed above we could experience interruptions of supply or increases in costs to deliver refined products to market if the ability of the pipelines or vessels to transport crude oil or refined products is disrupted because of weather events accidents governmental regulations or thirdparty actions a prolonged disruption of the ability of a pipeline or vessel to transport crude oil ngl or refined products to or from one or more of our refineries or other facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

index to financial statements 

increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in us production of crude oil and natural gas which could adversely impact our results of operations 

an increasing percentage of crude oil supplied to our refineries and the crude oil and gas production of our midstream segment’s customers is being produced from unconventional sources these reservoirs require hydraulic fracturing completion processes to release the hydrocarbons from the rock so they can flow through casing to the surface hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water sand and chemicals under pressure into the formation to stimulate hydrocarbon production the us environmental protection agency as well as several state agencies have commenced studies andor convened hearings regarding the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities at the same time certain environmental groups have suggested that additional laws may be needed to more closely and uniformly regulate the hydraulic fracturing process and legislation has been proposed to provide for such regulation in addition some communities have adopted measures to ban hydraulic fracturing in their communities we cannot predict whether any such legislation will ever be enacted and if so what its provisions would be any additional levels of regulation and permits required with the adoption of new laws and regulations at the federal or state level could result in our having to rely on higher priced crude oil for our refineries this could lead to delays increased operating costs and process prohibitions that could reduce the volumes of natural gas that move through dcp midstream’s gathering systems and could reduce supplies and increase costs of ngl feedstocks to cpchem ethylene facilities this could materially adversely affect our results of operations and the ability of dcp midstream and cpchem to make cash distributions to us 

dcp midstream’s success depends on its ability to obtain new sources of natural gas and ngl any decrease in the volumes of natural gas dcp midstream gathers could adversely affect its business and operating results 

dcp midstream’s gathering and transportation pipeline systems are connected to or dependent on the level of production from natural gas wells which will naturally decline over time as a result its cash flows associated with these wells will also decline over time in order to maintain or increase throughput levels on its gathering and transportation pipeline systems and ngl pipelines and the asset utilization rates at its natural gas processing plants dcp midstream must continually obtain new supplies the primary factors affecting dcp midstream’s ability to obtain new supplies of natural gas and ngl and to attract new customers to its assets include the level of successful drilling activity near these assets prices of and the demand for natural gas and crude oil producers’ desire and ability to obtain necessary permits in an efficient manner natural gas field characteristics and production performance surface access and infrastructure issues and its ability to compete for volumes from successful new wells if dcp midstream is not able to obtain new supplies of natural gas to replace the natural decline in volumes from existing wells or because of competition throughput on its pipelines and the utilization rates of its treating and processing facilities would decline this could have a material adverse effect on its business results of operations financial position and cash flows and its ability to make cash distributions to us 

competitors that produce their own supply of feedstocks have more extensive retail outlets or have greater financial resources may have a competitive advantage 

the refining and marketing industry is highly competitive with respect to both feedstock supply and refined product markets we compete with many companies for available supplies of crude oil and other feedstocks and for outlets for our refined products we do not produce any of our crude oil feedstocks some of our competitors however obtain a portion of their feedstocks from their own production and some have more extensive retail outlets than we have competitors that have their own production or extensive retail outlets and greater brandname recognition are at times able to offset losses from refining operations with profits from producing or retailing operations and may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages 

some of our competitors also have materially greater financial and other resources than we have such competitors have a greater ability to bear the economic risks inherent in all phases of our business in addition we compete with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel requirements of our industrial commercial and individual customers 

index to financial statements 

we may incur losses as a result of our forwardcontract activities and derivative transactions 

we currently use commodity derivative instruments and we expect to use them in the future if the instruments we utilize to hedge our exposure to various types of risk are not effective we may incur losses derivative transactions involve the risk that counterparties may be unable to satisfy their obligations to us the risk of counterparty default is heightened in a poor economic environment 

one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of a publicly traded master limited partnership phillips 66 partners lp which may involve a greater exposure to legal liability than our historic business operations 

one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of phillips 66 partners lp a publicly traded master limited partnership our control of the general partner of phillips 66 partners may increase the possibility that we could be subject to claims of breach of fiduciary duties including claims of conflicts of interest related to phillips 66 partners any liability resulting from such claims could have a material adverse effect on our future business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a significant interruption in one or more of our facilities could adversely affect our business

the level of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the expected return on plan assets for our pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans are evaluated by us based on a variety of independent market information and in consultation with outside actuaries if we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected longterm rate of return or health care cost trend rate our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses and funding requirements could increase in addition several factors could cause actual results to differ significantly from the actuarial assumptions that we use funding obligations are determined based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date as required under relevant regulations future pension funding requirements and the timing of funding payments could be affected by legislation enacted by governmental authorities 

in connection with the separation conocophillips has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities and we have agreed to indemnify conocophillips for certain liabilities if we are required to act on these indemnities to conocophillips we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations and our financial results could be negatively impacted the conocophillips indemnity may not be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of liabilities for which it has been allocated responsibility and conocophillips may not be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future 

pursuant to the indemnification and release agreement and certain other agreements with conocophillips entered into in connection with the separation conocophillips agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities and we agreed to indemnify conocophillips for certain liabilities indemnities that we may be required to provide conocophillips are not subject to any cap may be significant and could negatively impact our business particularly indemnities relating to our actions that could impact the taxfree nature of the distribution of phillips 66 stock third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that conocophillips has agreed to retain further the indemnity from conocophillips may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities and conocophillips may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations moreover even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from conocophillips any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves each of these risks could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to continuing contingent liabilities of conocophillips following the separation 

notwithstanding the separation there are several significant areas where the liabilities of conocophillips may become our obligations for example under the internal revenue code and the related rules and regulations each corporation that was a member of the conocophillips consolidated us federal income tax reporting group during any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the effective time of the separation is jointly and severally liable for the us federal income tax liability of the entire conocophillips consolidated tax reporting group for that taxable period in connection with the separation we entered into the tax sharing agreement with conocophillips that allocates the responsibility for prior period taxes of the conocophillips consolidated tax reporting group between us and conocophillips conocophillips may be unable to pay any prior period taxes for which it is responsible and we could be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes other provisions of federal law establish similar liability for other matters including laws governing taxqualified pension plans as well as other contingent liabilities 

if the distribution in connection with the separation together with certain related transactions does not qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes our stockholders and conocophillips could be subject to significant tax liability and in certain circumstances we could be required to indemnify conocophillips for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax sharing agreement 

conocophillips received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service irs substantially to the effect that among other things the distribution together with certain related transactions qualified as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code the private letter ruling and the tax opinion that conocophillips received relied on certain representations assumptions and undertakings including those relating to the past and future conduct of our business and neither the private letter ruling nor the opinion would be valid if such representations assumptions and undertakings were incorrect moreover the private letter ruling does not address all the issues that are relevant to determining whether the distribution qualified for taxfree treatment notwithstanding the private letter ruling and the tax opinion the irs could determine the distribution should be treated 

index to financial statements 

as a taxable transaction for us federal income tax purposes if it determines any of the representations assumptions or undertakings that were included in the request for the private letter ruling are false or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion that are not covered by the irs ruling 

if the irs were to determine that the distribution failed to qualify for taxfree treatment in general conocophillips would be subject to tax as if it had sold the phillips 66 common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value and conocophillips stockholders who received shares of phillips 66 common stock in the distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares 

under the tax sharing agreement we would generally be required to indemnify conocophillips against any tax resulting from the distribution to the extent that such tax resulted from i any of our representations or undertakings being incorrect or violated or ii other actions or failures to act by us our indemnification obligations to conocophillips and its subsidiaries officers and directors are not limited by any maximum amount if we are required to indemnify conocophillips or such other persons under the circumstances set forth in the tax sharing agreement we may be subject to substantial liabilities

business environment 

commodity prices remained compressed during 2016  the discount for us benchmark west texas intermediate wti versus the international benchmark brent narrowed over much of 2016  as the reemergence of floating storage pressured prompt waterborne markets over the course of 2016 commodity prices had a variety of impacts both favorable and unfavorable on our businesses that vary by segment 

earnings in the midstream segment which includes our 50 percent equity investment in dcp midstream are closely linked to ngl prices natural gas prices and crude oil prices average natural gas prices in 2016 were slightly lower than 2015 due to warmerthannormal temperatures and high storage in the fourth quarter of 2016 natural gas prices gained momentum with colder temperatures and increased residential and commercial heating demand total us dry natural gas production also increased through the fourth quarter of 2016 largely from the marcellus play where new pipeline takeaway capacity came online in december 2016 ngl prices improved slightly throughout 2016  due to an increase in export capacity in the united states 

  

during 2016  our chemicals segment which consists of our 50 percent equity investment in cpchem continued to benefit from feedstock cost advantages associated with manufacturing ethylene in regions of the world with significant ngl production the chemicals and plastics industry is mainly a commoditybased industry where the margins for key products are based on supply and demand as well as cost factors the petrochemicals industry continues to experience lower ethylene cash costs in regions of the world where ethylene manufacturing is based upon ngl rather than crude oilderived feedstocks in particular companies with north american light nglbased crackers have benefited from lowerpriced feedstocks the ethylenetopolyethylene chain margins remained positive but they compressed in 2016  because of the significant decline in crude oil prices that began in 2014 

our refining segment results are driven by several factors including refining margins cost control refinery throughput and product yields refinery margins often referred to as crack spreads are measured as the difference between market prices for refined petroleum products and crude oil during 2016  the us 321 crack spread three barrels of crude oil producing two barrels of gasoline and one barrel of diesel weakened across all quarters compared with 2015 largely attributable to higher product inventories resulting from historically high refining throughput especially in the gulf coast and midcontinent regions northwest european crack spreads on average decreased in 2016 compared to 2015 also because of high product inventories resulting from high refinery utilization 

results for our marketing and specialties ms segment depend largely on marketing fuel margins lubricant margins and other specialty product margins while ms margins are primarily based on market factors largely determined by the relationship between supply and demand marketing fuel margins in particular are influenced by the trend of spot prices for refined products generally speaking a downward trend of spot prices has a favorable impact on marketing fuel margins while an upward trend of spot prices has an unfavorable impact on marketing fuel margins

 based on index prices from the mont belvieu and conway market hubs that are weighted by ngl component and location mix 



pipelines represent the sum of volumes transported through each separately tariffed pipeline segment including our share of equity volumes from yellowstone pipe line company and lake charles pipe line company 

 represents 100 percent of dcp midstream’s volumes 

excludes dcp midstream 

  

the midstream segment gathers processes transports and markets natural gas and transports stores fractionates and markets ngl in the united states in addition this segment transports crude oil and other feedstocks to our refineries and other locations delivers refined and specialty products to market and provides terminaling and storage services for crude oil and petroleum products the segment also stores refrigerates and exports liquefied petroleum gas lpg primarily to asia and europe the midstream segment includes our master limited partnership mlp phillips 66 partners lp as well as our 50 percent equity investment in dcp midstream llc which includes the operations of its mlp dcp midstream lp formerly named dcp midstream partners lp and referred to herein as dcp partners 

2016  vs 2015   

earnings from the midstream segment increased   165 million  in 2016  compared with 2015  the increase was primarily due to improved results from dcp midstream partially offset by lower earnings from our transportation and ngl businesses 

transportation earnings decreased   42 million  in 2016  compared with 2015  lower earnings primarily resulted from higher operating costs and increased depreciation expense due to growth projects as well as increased income attributable to noncontrolling interests reflecting the contribution of assets to phillips 66 partners these items were partially offset by higher revenues from increased throughput volumes and higher tariffs 

index to financial statements 

results from our investment in dcp midstream improved 291 million  in 2016  compared with 2015  in 2015 dcp midstream recorded goodwill and other asset impairments which reduced our earnings from dcp midstream by 232 million aftertax in addition favorable contract restructuring efforts improved asset performance higher earnings from dcp midstream’s equity affiliates lower operating costs and higher ngl prices contributed to better results in 2016 these improvements were partially offset by lower natural gas and crude oil prices 

results from our ngl business decreased   84 million  in 2016  compared with 2015  the decrease was primarily driven by lower realized margins as well as increased depreciation and operating expenses associated with the sweeny fractionator and late in the year the freeport lpg export terminal these items were partially offset by higher fractionated volumes reflecting the operation of the sweeny fractionator for a full year in 2016 and the benefit of the first liquefied petroleum gas cargos exported from the freeport lpg export terminal in late 2016 

see the “business environment and executive overview” section for information on market factors impacting 2016 results 

2015  vs 2014    

earnings from the midstream segment decreased 494 million in 2015 compared with 2014 the decrease was primarily due to lower earnings from dcp midstream and our ngl business partially offset by higher earnings from our transportation business 

transportation earnings increased 55 million in 2015 compared with 2014 this increase reflects the startup of our bayway and ferndale crude oil rail unloading facilities in the second half of 2014 as well as a full year of operations from the beaumont terminal acquired in 2014 increased railcar fleet activities higher terminal revenues and improved earnings from equity affiliates also benefited earnings in 2015 these benefits were partially offset by higher earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests 

earnings associated with our investment in dcp midstream decreased 459 million in 2015 compared with 2014 the decrease in 2015 mainly resulted from lower ngl crude oil and natural gas prices partially offset by increased volumes due to asset growth and lower operating costs as a result of cost saving initiatives in addition goodwill and other asset impairments recorded by dcp midstream in 2015 contributed to the loss recognized from our investment in dcp midstream dcp midstream performed a goodwill impairment assessment and other asset impairment assessments based on internal discounted cash flow models taking into account various observable and nonobservable factors such as prices volumes expenses and discount rates the impairment tests resulted in dcp midstream’s recognition of a 460 million goodwill impairment and  342 million in other asset impairments net of tax impacts together these impairments reduced our equity earnings from dcp midstream   by 232 million aftertax 

dcp partners periodically issues limited partner units to the public these issuances benefited our equity in earnings from dcp midstream on an aftertax basis by approximately 1 million in 2015 compared with approximately 45 million in 2014 

the earnings from our ngl business decreased 90 million in 2015 compared with 2014 the decrease was primarily driven by lower realized margins and higher earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests we also incurred higher tax expense in 2015 driven by a lower manufacturing deduction resulting from bonus depreciation associated with the startup of the sweeny fractionator these decreases were partially offset by higher earnings from equity affiliates

chemicals 

  



the chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in cpchem which we account for under the equity method cpchem uses ngl and other feedstocks to produce petrochemicals these products are then marketed and sold or used as feedstocks to produce plastics and other chemicals we structure our reporting of cpchem’s operations around two primary business segments olefins and polyolefins op and specialties aromatics and styrenics sas the op business segment produces and markets ethylene and other olefin products ethylene produced is primarily consumed within cpchem for the production of polyethylene normal alpha olefins and polyethylene pipe the sas business segment manufactures and markets aromatics and styrenics products such as benzene styrene paraxylene and cyclohexane as well as polystyrene and styrenebutadiene copolymers sas also manufactures andor markets a variety of specialty chemical products unless otherwise noted amounts referenced below reflect our net 50 percent interest in cpchem 

2016  vs 2015   

earnings from the chemicals segment decreased   379 million  or 39 percent  in 2016  compared with 2015  the decrease in earnings was primarily due to lower realized margins from the op business driven by a decline in sales prices for polyethylene and normal alpha olefins nao and higher feedstock costs as well as impacts from increased turnaround activity lower equity earnings from cpchem’s equity affiliates and lower sas volumes further reduced earnings in 2016 

in addition cpchem recognized a 177 million impairment in 2016 due to lower demand and margin factors affecting an equity affiliate which resulted in an 89 million aftertax reduction in our equity earnings from cpchem our equity earnings from cpchem were reduced by 24 million in 2015 as a result of an impairment cpchem recognized on an equity affiliate these items were partially offset by higher nao and polyethylene sales volumes and improved sas margins 

see the “business environment and executive overview” section for information on market factors impacting cpchem’s results 

index to financial statements 

2015  vs 2014 

earnings from the chemicals segment decreased 175 million or 15 percent in 2015 compared with 2014 the decrease in earnings was primarily due to lower margins resulting from lower sales prices lower earnings from cpchem’s op equity affiliates and higher turnaround and maintenance activities 

these decreases were partially offset by higher ethylene and polyethylene sales volumes as well as lower repair costs due to the impact on 2014 costs of a fire at cpchem’s port arthur texas facility lower feedstock costs lower utility costs due to falling natural gas prices and lower impairment charges also benefited the 2015 operating results 

in july 2014 a localized fire occurred in the olefins unit at cpchem’s port arthur texas facility shutting down ethylene production the port arthur ethylene unit restarted in november 2014 cpchem incurred on a 100 percent basis 85 million of associated repair and rebuild costs because the port arthur ethylene unit was down due to the fire cpchem experienced a significant reduction in production and sales in several of its product lines stemming from the lack of the port arthur ethylene supply in 2014 cpchem recorded earnings on a 100 percent basis of 88 million and 120 million for business interruption and property damage insurance proceeds in 2015 and 2014 respectively

refining 

  



index to financial statements 

the refining segment buys sells and refines crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products such as gasoline distillates and aviation fuels at 13  refineries mainly in the united states and europe 

2016  vs 2015   

earnings for the refining segment decreased   2181 million  compared with 2015  lower earnings in 2016  reflected lower realized refining margins resulting from decreased market crack spreads higher costs associated with renewable fuels blending activities lower clean product differentials and lower feedstock advantage these items were partially offset by higher volumes due to lower turnaround activities and less unplanned downtime 

see the “business environment and executive overview” section for information on industry crack spreads and other market factors impacting this year’s results 

our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 96 percent  in 2016  compared to 91 percent  in 2015  the increase was primarily attributable to lower turnaround activities and less unplanned downtime 

merey sweeny lp mslp owns a delayed coker and related facilities at the sweeny refinery mslp processes long residue which is produced from heavy sour crude oil for a processing fee fuelgrade petroleum coke is produced as a byproduct and becomes the property of mslp as more fully discussed in note 5—business combinations  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in february 2017 the time expired for all legal challenges related to the exercise in 2009 of a call right to acquire petróleos de venezuela sa’s pdvsa 50 percent share of mslp and we began accounting for mslp as a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary based on a preliminary appraisal the acquisition of pdvsa’s 50 percent interest is expected to result in our recording a noncash pretax gain of approximately 420 million  in the first quarter of 2017 

2015  vs 2014   

earnings for the refining segment increased 784 million or 44 percent compared with 2014 the increase in earnings in 2015 primarily resulted from higher realized refining margins due to higher gasoline crack spreads and improved secondary product margins as well as lower utility costs these increases were partially offset by lower feedstock advantage lower distillate crack spreads lower clean product differentials and lower refining volumes as a result of higher unplanned downtime and turnaround activities 

our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 91 percent in 2015 compared to 94 percent in 2014 the decrease reflects higher unplanned downtime and turnaround activities

2016  vs 2015   

earnings from the ms segment decreased   296 million  or 25 percent  in 2016  compared with 2015  the decrease was mainly attributable to the 242 million deferred gain recognized in 2015 related to the 2013 ichp sale see note 6—assets held for sale or sold  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

also contributing to the lower earnings in 2016 were lower realized marketing margins driven by an upward trend of spot prices during most of 2016 and lower margins and volumes in lubricants these decreases were partially offset by favorable tax adjustments and higher marketing volumes 

see the “business environment and executive overview” section for information on marketing fuel margins and other market factors impacting 2016 results

2015  vs 2014 

earnings from the ms segment increased 153 million or 15 percent in 2015 compared with 2014 in july 2013 we completed the sale of ichp and deferred the gain from the sale due to an indemnity provided to the buyer we recognized 242 million aftertax and 126 million aftertax of the deferred gain in 2015 and 2014 respectively 

earnings from the ms segment also benefited from higher domestic marketing activities higher domestic marketing and lubricants volumes and increased tax credits from biodiesel blending activities these benefits were partially offset by lower international marketing margins and lubricants margins 

corporate and other 

  



2016  vs 2015 

net interest expense consists of interest and financing expense net of interest income and capitalized interest net interest expense increased   24 million  in 2016  compared with 2015  mainly due to lower capitalized interest 

the category “other” includes certain income tax expenses environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation foreign currency transaction gains and losses and other costs not directly associated with an operating segment the decrease in other costs in 2016 was primarily attributable to favorable tax impacts the writeoff of certain fixed assets during 2015 and the impact of an increase in noncontrolling interests on interest expense incurred by phillips 66 partners partially offset by higher environmental accruals 

2015  vs 2014 

net interest expense increased 26 million in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to a higher average debt principal balance as a result of the issuance of debt in the fourth quarter of 2014 and phillips 66 partners’ debt issuance in the first quarter of 2015 the increase was partially offset by higher capitalized interest for additional information see note 13—debt  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the increase in other costs in 2015 was primarily due to foreign tax credit carryforwards that were utilized in 2014 and other tax adjustments made in 2015

capital resources and liquidity 

financial indicators 



to meet our short and longterm liquidity requirements we look to a variety of funding sources including cash generated from operating activities and phillips 66 partners’ debt and equity financings during 2016  we generated 30 billion  in cash from operations phillips 66 partners issued debt and common units to the public for net proceeds totaling 21 billion  we used this available cash primarily for capital expenditures and investments  28 billion  repurchases of our common stock  10 billion  and dividend payments on our common stock  13 billion  during 2016  cash and cash equivalents decreased  by 04 billion  to 27 billion  

in addition to cash flows from operating activities we rely on our commercial paper and credit facility programs asset sales and our ability to issue securities using our shelf registration statement to support our short and longterm liquidity requirements we believe current cash and cash equivalents and cash generated by operations together with access to external sources of funds as described below under “significant sources of capital” will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near and long term including our capital spending dividend payments defined benefit plan contributions debt repayment and share repurchases 

significant sources of capital 

operating activities 

during 2016  cash of  2963 million  was provided by operating activities a 48 percent decrease  compared with 2015  the decrease was primarily attributable to lower realized refining margins as well as a reduction in distributions from our equity affiliates this decrease was partially offset by positive working capital of 501 million in 2016 compared to a negative working capital impact of 221 million in 2015 the positive working capital impact in 2016 was primarily driven by increased refining payables due to an increase in feedstock costs at the end of 2016 as compared with 2015 and the timing of tax payments and refunds partially offset by an increase in receivables resulting from higher commodity prices see the following paragraph for a discussion of 2015 working capital effects 

during 2015  cash of  5713 million  was provided by operating activities a 62 percent   increase  from cash from operations of  3529 million  in 2014  net income in 2015 was lower than 2014 however in both years large noncash items affected earnings including the gain on the pspi exchange in 2014 recognition in 2015 and 2014 of a deferred gain from a 2013 asset disposition and goodwill and other asset impairments by dcp midstream in 2015 excluding these items underlying earnings in 2015 were slightly improved compared with 2014 primarily reflecting increased refining margins and increased domestic marketing volumes partially offset by lower midstream prices negative working capital impacted operating cash flow by 221 million and 1020 million in 2015 and 2014 respectively the lower negative working capital impact in 2015 was driven by decreased refining payables due to lower feedstock costs in 2015 as compared with 2014 partially offset by a reduction in receivables due to reduced commodity prices 

index to financial statements 

our short and longterm operating cash flows are highly dependent upon refining and marketing margins ngl prices and chemicals margins prices and margins in our industry are typically volatile and are driven by market conditions over which we have little or no control absent other mitigating factors as these prices and margins fluctuate we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows 

the level and quality of output from our refineries also impacts our cash flows factors such as operating efficiency maintenance turnarounds market conditions feedstock availability and weather conditions can affect output we actively manage the operations of our refineries and any variability in their operations typically has not been as significant to cash flows as that caused by margins and prices our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization was 96 percent  in 2016  compared with 91 percent  in 2015  

equity affiliates 

our operating cash flows are also impacted by distribution decisions made by our equity affiliates including dcp midstream cpchem and wrb over the three years ended december 31 2016  we received distributions of 237 million  from dcp midstream 2241 million  from cpchem and  1568 million  from wrb we cannot control the amount or timing of future distributions from equity affiliates therefore future distributions by these and other equity affiliates are not assured 

effective january 1 2017 dcp midstream llc and dcp partners closed a transaction in which dcp midstream llc contributed subsidiaries owning all of its operating assets 424 million  of cash and 315 billion  of debt to dcp partners in exchange for dcp partners units which had an estimated fair value of 1125 billion  at the time of the transaction we and our coventurer retained our 5050 investment in dcp midstream llc and dcp midstream llc retained its incentive distribution rights in dcp partners through its ownership of the general partner of dcp partners after the transaction dcp midstream llc held a 38 percent  interest in dcp partners dcp midstream llc through its ownership of the general partner has agreed if required to forgo receipt of incentive distribution rights up to 100 million  annually 100 percent basis through 2019 to support a minimum distribution coverage ratio for dcp partners in connection with the transaction dcp midstream llc terminated its revolving credit agreement which had previously served to limit distributions to its owners while amounts had been borrowed under the facility as a result we expect distributions to the owners of dcp midstream llc to resume in 2017 as it receives distributions from dcp partners  

in 2015 cpchem made a special distribution to its owners with our share totaling 696 million cpchem funded the distribution by issuing 14 billion of senior notes with maturities ranging from three to five years with a combination of fixed and variable interest rates this cash inflow from cpchem was included in operating cash flows as we had cumulative undistributed equity earnings attributable to cpchem in excess of the amount distributed cpchem’s us gulf coast project is expected to be completed and begin commercial operations during 2017 as a result we expect distributions from cpchem to increase starting in 2017 as capital spending by cpchem on this project ends 

wrb is a 50percentowned business venture with cenovus energy inc cenovus cenovus was obligated to contribute 75 billion plus accrued interest to wrb over a 10year period that began in 2007 in 2014 cenovus prepaid its remaining balance under this obligation as a result wrb declared a special dividend which was distributed to the coventurers in 2014 of the 1232 million that we received 760 million was considered a return on our investment in wrb an operating cash inflow and 472 million was considered a return of our investment in wrb an investing cash inflow the returnofinvestment portion of the dividend was included in the “proceeds from asset dispositions” line in our consolidated statement of cash flows a further 129 million of distributions from wrb during 2014 was considered a return of investment 

asset sales 

net proceeds from asset sales in 2016  were  156 million  compared with  70 million  in 2015  and  1244 million  in 2014  the 2016 net proceeds were primarily attributed to the sale of the whitegate refinery in ireland the 2015 net proceeds were attributed to the sale of the bantry bay terminal in ireland and the sale of certain retail sites in kansas and missouri and were partially offset by a working capital trueup related to the 2014 sale of our interest in the malaysia refining company sdn bdh mrc the 2014 proceeds included a portion of the wrb special dividend as discussed above as well as the sale of our interest in mrc

foreign cash holdings 

at december 31 2016 approximately 53 percent of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents balance was available to fund domestic opportunities without incurring material us income taxes in excess of the amounts already accrued in the financial statements we believe the remaining amount primarily attributable to cash we hold in foreign locations where we have asserted our intention to indefinitely reinvest earnings does not materially affect our consolidated liquidity due to the following factors 

 

see note 21—income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on income taxes associated with foreign earnings 

phillips 66 partners lp 

in 2013 we formed phillips 66 partners lp a publicly traded master limited partnership to own operate develop and acquire primarily feebased crude oil refined petroleum product and ngl pipelines and terminals as well as other midstream assets 

ownership 

at december 31 2016  we owned a 59 percent  limited partner interest and a 2 percent general partner interest in phillips 66 partners while its public unitholders owned a 39 percent  limited partner interest we consolidate phillips 66 partners as a variable interest entity for financial reporting purposes see note 3—variable interest entities  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on why we consolidate the partnership as a result of this consolidation the public unitholders’ ownership interest in phillips 66 partners is reflected as a 1306 million  noncontrolling interest in our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2016  generally drop down transactions to phillips 66 partners will eliminate in consolidation except for thirdparty debt or equity offerings made by phillips 66 partners to finance such transactions through the public offerings of common units and senior notes discussed below our consolidated cash increased by 21 billion  consolidated debt increased by 11 billion  and consolidated equity increased by 791 million

credit facilities and commercial paper 

in october 2016 we amended our phillips 66 revolving credit facility primarily to extend the term from december 2019 to october 2021 borrowing capacity under the phillips 66 facility remained at 5 billion the facility may be used for direct bank borrowings as support for issuances of letters of credit or as support for our commercial paper program the facility is with a broad syndicate of financial institutions and contains covenants that we consider usual and customary for an agreement of this type for comparable commercial borrowers including a maximum consolidated net debttocapitalization ratio of 60 percent the agreement has customary events of default such as nonpayment of principal when due nonpayment of interest fees or other amounts violation of covenants crosspayment default and crossacceleration in each case to indebtedness in excess of a threshold amount and a change of control borrowings under the facility will incur interest at the london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin based on the credit rating of our senior unsecured longterm debt as determined from time to time by standard  poor’s ratings services sp and moody’s investors service moody’s the facility also provides for customary fees including administrative agent fees and commitment fees as of december 31 2016  no amount had been directly drawn under our 5 billion credit facility however 51 million  in letters of credit had been issued that were supported by this facility 

we have a 5 billion  commercial paper program for shortterm working capital needs that is supported by our revolving credit facility commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days as of december 31 2016  we had no  borrowings under our commercial paper program

debt financing 

our 75 billion of outstanding senior notes issued by phillips 66 are guaranteed by phillips 66 company a 100percentowned subsidiary our senior unsecured longterm debt has been rated investment grade by sp bbb and moody’s a3 we do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default and thereby impact our access to liquidity in the event of a downgrade of our credit rating if our credit rating deteriorated to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market we would expect to be able to access funds under our liquidity facilities mentioned above 

shelf registration 

we have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the sec under which we as a wellknown seasoned issuer have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities 

other financing

chemicals 

during the threeyear period ended december 31 2016  cpchem had a selffunded capital program and thus required no new capital infusions from us or our coventurer during this period on a 100 percent basis cpchem’s capital expenditures and investments were 64 billion  in addition cpchem’s advances to equity affiliates primarily used for project construction and startup activities were 206 million  and its repayments received from equity affiliates were 81 million  

refining 

capital spending for the refining segment during the threeyear period ended december 31 2016  was 33 billion  primarily for air emission reduction and clean fuels projects to meet new environmental standards refinery upgrade projects to increase accessibility of advantaged crudes and improve product yields improvements to the operating integrity of key processing units and safetyrelated projects 

key projects completed during the threeyear period included 

 

major construction activities in progress include 

 

generally our equity affiliates in the refining segment are intended to have selffunding capital programs during this threeyear period on a 100 percent basis wrb’s capital expenditures and investments were 958 million  we expect wrb’s 2017  capital program to be selffunding 

marketing and specialties 

capital spending for the ms segment during the threeyear period ended december 31 2016  was primarily for the acquisition of and investments in a limited number of retail sites in the western and midwestern portions of the united states which have subsequently been disposed of the acquisition of spectrum corporation a private label specialty lubricants business headquartered in memphis tennessee the acquisition of the remaining interest that we did not already own in an entity that operates a power and steam generation plant reliability and maintenance projects and projects targeted at developing our new international sites 

corporate and other 

capital spending for corporate and other during the threeyear period ended december 31 2016  was primarily for projects related to information technology and facilities 

2017  budget 

our 2017  capital budget is 27 billion including phillips 66 partners’ c apital budget of 04 billion this excludes our portion of planned capital spending by joint ventures dcp midstream cpchem and wrb totaling  11 billion  all of which is expected to be selffunded 

index to financial statements 

the midstream capital budget of 15 billion is focused on development around its existing infrastructure’s footprint including continued expansion of the beaumont terminal and investment in pipelines and other terminals refining’s capital budget of 09 billion is directed toward reliability safety and environmental projects as well as projects designed to improve clean product yields and lower feedstock costs in ms we plan to invest approximately 01 billion to expand and enhance our fuel marketing business in corporate and other we plan to fund approximately 01 billion in projects primarily related to information technology and facilities 

contingencies 

a number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims that arose in the ordinary course of business have been filed against us or are subject to indemnifications provided by us we also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement storage disposal or release of certain chemical mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites we regularly assess the need for financial recognition or disclosure of these contingencies in the case of all known contingencies other than those related to income taxes we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable if a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount then the minimum of the range is accrued we do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or thirdparty recoveries if applicable we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other thirdparty recoveries in the case of incometaxrelated contingencies we use a cumulative probabilityweighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain 

based on currently available information we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements as we learn new facts concerning contingencies we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include contingent liabilities recorded for environmental remediation tax and legal matters estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other potentially responsible parties estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes 

legal and tax matters 

our legal and tax matters are handled by our legal and tax organizations these organizations apply their knowledge experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases and uncertain tax positions we employ a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases and enables the tracking of those cases that have been scheduled for trial andor mediation based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals or establishment of new accruals is required in the case of incometaxrelated contingencies we monitor tax legislation and court decisions the status of tax audits and the statute of limitations within which a taxing authority can assert a liability see note 21—income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about incometaxrelated contingencies 

environmental 

like other companies in our industry we are subject to numerous international federal state and local environmental laws and regulations among the most significant of these international and federal environmental laws and regulations are the 

  



index to financial statements 

 these laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and in the case of discharges to water establish water quality limits they also in most cases require permits in association with new or modified operations these permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process which can be expensive and time consuming in addition there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency’s processing of the application many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant 

many states and foreign countries where we operate also have or are developing similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities for example in california the south coast air quality management district approved amendments to the regional clean air incentives market reclaim that became effective in 2016 which require a phased reduction of nitrogen oxide emissions through 2022 and potentially affect refineries in the los angeles metropolitan area while similar in some cases these regulations may impose additional or more stringent requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of developing infrastructure and marketing or transporting products across state and international borders 

the ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards such as air emission standards water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations continue to evolve however environmental laws and regulations including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the united states and in other countries in which we operate notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the united states 

an example of this in the fuels area is the energy policy act of 2005 which imposed obligations to provide increasing volumes of renewable fuels in transportation motor fuels through 2012 these obligations were changed with the enactment of the energy independence and security act of 2007 eisa eisa requires fuel producers and importers to provide additional renewable fuels for transportation motor fuels and stipulates a mix of various types to be included through 2022 we have met the increasingly stringent requirements to date while establishing implementation operating and capital strategies along with advanced technology development to address projected future requirements it is uncertain how various future requirements contained in eisa and the regulations promulgated thereunder may be implemented and what their full impact may be on our operations for the 2017 compliance year the us environmental protection agency epa has set volumes of advanced and total renewable fuel at higher levels than mandated in previous years it is uncertain if these increased obligations will be achievable by fuel producers and shippers without drawing on the renewable identification number rin bank for compliance years after 2017 we do not know whether the epa will utilize its authority to reduce statutory volumes additionally we may experience a decrease in demand for refined petroleum products due to the regulatory program as currently promulgated this program continues to be the subject of possible congressional review and repromulgation in revised form and the epa’s regulations pertaining to the 2014 2015 and 2016 compliance years are subject to legal challenge further creating uncertainty regarding renewable fuel volume requirements and obligations 

the epa’s renewable fuel standard rfs program was also implemented in accordance with the energy policy act of 2005 and eisa the rfs program sets annual quotas for the percentage of biofuels such as ethanol that must be blended into motor fuels consumed in the united states a rin represents a serial number assigned to each gallon of biofuel produced or imported into the united states as a producer of petroleumbased motor fuels we are obligated to blend biofuels into the products we produce at a rate that is at least equal to the epa’s quota and to the extent we do not we must purchase rins in the open market to satisfy our obligation under the rfs program the market for rins has been the subject of fraudulent thirdparty activity and it is reasonably possible that some rins that we have purchased may be determined to be invalid should that occur we could incur costs to replace those fraudulent rins although the 

index to financial statements 

cost for replacing any fraudulently marketed rins is not reasonably estimable at this time we would not expect to incur the full financial impact of fraudulent rins replacement costs in any single interim or annual period and would not expect such costs to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

we also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations such laws and regulations include cercla and rcra and their state equivalents remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility arising from petroleum releases from underground storage tanks located at numerous previously and currently owned andor operated petroleummarketing outlets throughout the united states federal and state laws require contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards in addition to other cleanup standards many states have adopted cleanup criteria for methyl tertiarybutyl ether mtbe for both soil and groundwater 

at rcrapermitted facilities we are required to assess environmental conditions if conditions warrant we may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations in contrast to cercla which is often referred to as “superfund” the cost of corrective action activities under rcra corrective action programs typically is borne solely by us we anticipate increased expenditures for rcra remediation activities may be required but such annual expenditures for the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures we have experienced over the past few years longerterm expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly 

we occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the epa and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under cercla or an equivalent state statute on occasion we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties these requests notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations as of december 31 2015  we reported that we had been notified of potential liability under cercla and comparable state laws at 36  sites within the united states during 2016  there was one  new site for which we received notification of potential liability three  sites were resolved but not closed and three  sites were deemed resolved and closed leaving 31  unresolved sites with potential liability at december 31 2016  

for most superfund sites our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties is relatively low although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations and where they have not or where potentially responsible parties could not be located our share of liability has not increased materially many of the sites for which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the epa or the state agencies concerned prior to actual cleanup those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation in some instances we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain epa or equivalent state agency approval of a remediation plan there are relatively few sites where we are a major participant and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all cercla sites in the aggregate is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition 

expensed environmental costs were 648 million  in 2016  and are expected to be a similar amount in 2017  and in 2018  capitalized environmental costs were 224 million  in 2016  and are expected to be approximately 170 million  and 220 million  in 2017  and 2018  respectively this amount does not include capital expenditures made for another purpose that have an indirect benefit on environmental compliance 

accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted except those assumed in a purchase business combination which we record on a discounted basis 

many of these liabilities result from cercla rcra and similar state laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct or once conducted operations or at sites where our generated waste was disposed we also have accrued for a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation but which are not currently the subject of cercla rcra or state enforcement activities if applicable we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other thirdparty recoveries in the future we may incur significant costs under both cercla and rcra remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site 

index to financial statements 

depending on the mix of unique site characteristics evolving remediation technologies diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties therefore it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs 

notwithstanding any of the foregoing and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in our operations and products and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred however we currently do not expect any material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations 

climate change 

there has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state national and international laws focusing on greenhouse gas ghg emissions reduction including various regulations proposed or issued by the epa these proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in states andor countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future laws regulating ghg emissions continue to evolve and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation such laws potentially could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition as a result of increasing costs of compliance lengthening project implementation and agency review items or reducing demand for certain hydrocarbon products examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include 

  

 

in the eu the first phase of the eu ets completed at the end of 2007 and phase ii was undertaken from 2008 through to 2012 the current phase phase iii runs from 2013 through to 2020 with the main changes being reduced allocation of free allowances and increased auctioning of new allowances phillips 66 has assets that are subject to the eu ets and the company is actively engaged in minimizing any financial impact from the eu ets 

from november 30 to december 12 2015 more than 190 countries including the united states participated in the united nations climate change conference in paris france the conference culminated in what is known as the “paris agreement” which upon certain conditions being met entered into force on november 4 2016 the paris agreement establishes a commitment by signatory parties to pursue domestic ghg emission reductions 

in the united states some additional form of regulation is likely to be forthcoming in the future at the federal or state levels with respect to ghg emissions such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes the restriction of output investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws 

index to financial statements 

and regulations or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances we are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations 

compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a ghg emission trading program ghg reduction requirements or carbon taxes could significantly increase our costs reduce demand for fossil energy derived products impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources 

an example of one such program is california’s cap and trade program which was promulgated pursuant to the state’s global warming solutions act the program had been limited to certain stationary sources which include our refineries in california but beginning in january 2015 expanded to include emissions from transportation fuels distributed in california inclusion of transportation fuels in california’s cap and trade program as currently promulgated has increased our cap and trade program compliance costs the ultimate impact on our financial performance either positive or negative from this and similar programs will depend on a number of factors including but not limited to 

  

 

we consider and take into account anticipated future ghg emissions in designing and developing major facilities and projects and implement energy efficiency initiatives to reduce such emissions ghg emissions legal requirements regulating such emissions and the possible physical effects of climate change on our coastal assets are incorporated into our planning investment and risk management decisionmaking

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses see note 1—summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for descriptions of our major accounting policies certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions or if different assumptions had been used the following discussion of critical accounting estimates along with the discussion of contingencies in this report address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions could be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change 

impairments 

longlived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows is expected if the sum of the undiscounted pretax cash flows of an asset group is less than the carrying value including applicable liabilities the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets for example at a refinery complex level because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for longlived assets the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined using one or more of the following methods the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants a market multiple of earnings for similar assets or historical market transactions of similar assets adjusted using principal market participant assumptions when necessary the expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future volumes commodity prices operating costs margins discount rates and capital project decisions considering all available information at the date of review 

investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are assessed for impairment when there are indicators of a loss in value such as a lack of sustained earnings capacity or a current fair value less than the investment’s carrying amount when it is determined that an indicated impairment is other than temporary a charge is recognized for the difference between the investment’s carrying value and its estimated fair value 

when determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline the investee’s financial condition and nearterm prospects and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that allows for recovery when quoted market prices are not available the fair value is usually based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants and a market analysis of comparable assets if appropriate differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period 

asset retirement obligations 

under various contracts permits and regulations we have legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land at the end of operations at certain operational sites our largest asset removal obligations involve asbestos abatement at refineries estimating the timing and amount of payments for future asset removal costs is difficult most of these removal obligations are many years or decades in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs asset removal technologies and costs regulatory and other compliance considerations expenditure timing and other inputs into valuation of the obligation including discount and inflation rates are also subject to change 

environmental costs 

in addition to asset retirement obligations discussed above we have certain obligations to complete environmentalrelated projects these projects are primarily related to cleanup at domestic refineries underground storage sites and nonoperated sites future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs timing and extent of such remedial actions that may be required and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties 

index to financial statements 

intangible assets and goodwill 

at december 31 2016  we had 764 million  of intangible assets that we have determined to have indefinite useful lives and are not amortized this judgmental assessment of an indefinite useful life must be continuously evaluated in the future if due to changes in facts and circumstances management determines these intangible assets have finite useful lives amortization will commence at that time on a prospective basis as long as these intangible assets are judged to have indefinite lives they will be subject to annual impairment tests that require management’s judgment of the estimated fair value of these intangible assets 

at december 31 2016  we had 33 billion  of goodwill recorded in conjunction with past business combinations goodwill is not amortized instead goodwill is subject to at least annual reviews for impairment at a reporting unit level the reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed a reporting unit is an operating segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment 

because quoted market prices for our reporting units are not available management applies judgment in determining the estimated fair values of the reporting units for purposes of performing the goodwill impairment test management uses all available information to make this fair value determination including observed market earnings multiples of comparable companies our common stock price and associated total company market capitalization sales or dispositions of significant assets within a reporting unit are allocated a portion of that reporting unit’s goodwill based on relative fair values which impacts the amount of gain or loss on the sale or disposition 

we completed our annual impairment test as of october 1 2016 and concluded that the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded their respective recorded net book values including goodwill by over 25 percent for our refining reporting unit and by over 100 percent for our transportation and ms reporting units a decline in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units in the future could result in an impairment for example a prolonged or significant decline in our stock price or a significant decline in actual or forecasted earnings could provide evidence of a significant decline in fair value and a need to record a material impairment of goodwill for one or more of our reporting units after we have completed our annual test we continue to monitor for impairment indicators which can lead to further goodwill impairment testing 

tax assets and liabilities 

our operations are subject to various taxes including federal state and foreign income taxes property taxes and transactional taxes such as excise salesuse and payroll taxes we record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations the recording of tax liabilities requires significant judgment and estimates we recognize the financial statement effects of an income tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority a contingent liability related to a transactional tax claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and estimable actual incurred tax liabilities can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons including different interpretations of tax laws and regulations and different assessments of the amount of tax due 

in determining our income tax provision we assess the likelihood our deferred tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income valuation allowances reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized judgment is required in estimating the amount of valuation allowance if any that should be recorded against our deferred tax assets based on our historical taxable income our expectations for the future and available taxplanning strategies we expect the net deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as reductions to future taxable income if our actual results of operations differ from such estimates or our estimates of future taxable income change the valuation allowance may need to be revised 

new tax laws and regulations as well as changes to existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being proposed or promulgated the implementation of future legislative and regulatory tax initiatives could result in increased tax liabilities that cannot be predicted at this time 

projected benefit obligations 

determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans impacts the obligations on the balance sheet and the amount of benefit expense in the income statement the actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events including estimated retirement dates salary levels at retirement mortality rates lumpsum election rates rates of return on plan assets future interest rates future health care costtrend rates and rates of utilization of health care services by 

index to financial statements 

retirees due to the specialized nature of these calculations we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects ultimately we will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions a one percentagepoint decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by an estimated 60 million while a one percentagepoint decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by an estimated 30 million in determining the discount rate we use yields on highquality fixed income investments with payments matched to the estimated distributions of benefits from our plans 

in 2016 and 2015 we used expected longterm rates of return of 675 percent and 7 percent respectively for the us pension plan assets which account for 74 percent of our overall pension plan assets the actual us pension plan asset returns were a gain of 7 percent in 2016 and a loss of less than 1 percent in 2015 for the past ten years actual returns averaged 6 percent for the us pension plan assets 

new accounting standards 

in january 2017 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu 201704 “intangibles—goodwill and other—simplifying the test for goodwill impairment” which eliminates step 2 from the goodwill impairment test under the revised test an entity should perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value however the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit public business entities should apply the guidance in asu no 201704 for its annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2019 with early adoption permitted we are currently evaluating the provisions of asu no 201704 

in january 2017 the fasb issued asu no 201701 “business combinations clarifying the definition of a business” which clarifies the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist in evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions of assets or businesses the amendment provides a screen for determining when a transaction involves the acquisition of a business if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets then the transaction does not involve the acquisition of a business if the screen is not met then the amendment requires that to be considered a business the operation must include at a minimum an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create an output the guidance may reduce the number of transactions accounted for as business acquisitions public business entities should apply the guidance in asu no 201701 to annual periods beginning after december 15 2017 including interim periods within those periods with early adoption permitted the amendments should be applied prospectively and no disclosures are required at the effective date we are currently evaluating the provisions of asu no 201701 

in november 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201618 “statement of cash flows topic 230 restricted cash” which clarifies the classification and presentation of changes in restricted cash the amendment requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash cash equivalents and amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents public business entities should apply the guidance in asu no 201618 on a retrospective basis for annual periods beginning after december 15 2017 including interim periods within those annual periods with early adoption permitted we do not expect the adoption of this asu to have a material impact on our financial statements 

in august 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201615 “statement of cash flows topic 230 classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments” which clarifies the treatment of several cash flow categories in addition asu no 201615 clarifies that when cash receipts and cash payments have aspects of more than one class of cash flows and cannot be separated classification will depend on the predominant source or use public business entities should apply

in february 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201602 “leases topic 842” in the new standard the fasb modified its determination of whether a contract is a lease rather than whether a lease is a capital or operating lease under the previous accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap a contract represents a lease if a transfer of control occurs over an identified property plant and equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration control over the use of the identified asset includes the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the asset and the right to direct its use the fasb continued to maintain two classifications of leases —  financing and operating —  which are substantially similar to capital and operating leases in the previous lease guidance under the new standard recognition of assets and liabilities arising from operating leases will require recognition on the balance sheet the effect of all leases in the statement of comprehensive income and the statement of cash flows will be largely unchanged lessor accounting will also be largely unchanged additional disclosures will be required for financing and operating leases for both lessors and lessees public business entities should apply the guidance in asu no 201602 for annual periods beginning after december 15 2018 including interim periods within those annual periods early adoption is permitted we are currently evaluating the provisions of asu no 201602 and assessing its impact on our financial statements

financial instrument market risk 

we and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose our cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates we may use financial and commoditybased derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of crude oil and related products natural gas ngl and electric power fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates or to capture market opportunities 

our use of derivative instruments is governed by an “authority limitations” document approved by our board of directors that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient market liquidity for comparable valuations the authority limitations document also establishes value at risk var limits and compliance with these limits is monitored daily our chief financial officer monitors risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates our president monitors commodity price risk the commercial organization manages our commercial marketing optimizes our commodity flows and positions and monitors related risks of our businesses 

commodity price risk 

we sell into or receive supply from the worldwide crude oil refined products natural gas ngl and electric power markets exposing our revenues purchases cost of operating activities and cash flows to fluctuations in the prices for these commodities generally our policy is to remain exposed to the market prices of commodities consistent with this policy our commercial organization uses derivative contracts to effectively convert our exposure from fixedprice sales contracts often requested by refined product customers back to fluctuating market prices conversely our commercial organization also uses futures forwards swaps and options in various markets to accomplish the following objectives to optimize the value of our supply chain and this may reduce our exposure to fluctuations in market prices 

 

we use a var model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments held or issued including commodity purchase and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at december 31 2016  as derivative instruments using monte carlo simulation a 95 percent confidence level and a oneday holding period the var for those instruments issued or held for trading purposes at december 31 2016  and 2015  was immaterial to our cash flows and net income the var for instruments held for purposes other than trading at december 31 2016  and 2015  was also immaterial to our cash flows and net income

interest rate risk 

our use of fixed or variablerate debt directly exposes us to interest rate risk fixedrate debt such as our senior notes exposes us to changes in the fair value of our debt due to changes in market interest rates fixedrate debt also exposes us to the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at higher rates or that we may be obligated to pay rates higher than the current market variablerate debt such as borrowings under our revolving credit facility exposes us to shortterm changes in market rates that impact our interest expense the following tables provide information about our debt instruments that are sensitive to changes in us interest rates these tables present principal cash flows and related weightedaverage interest rates by expected maturity dates weightedaverage variable rates are based on effective rates at the reporting date the carrying amount of our floatingrate debt approximates its fair value the fair value of the fixedrate financial instruments is estimated based on quoted market prices

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form 10k each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition as well as affect the value of an investment in our common stock 

our operating results and future rate of growth are exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices and refining marketing and petrochemical margins 

our revenues operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent on a number of factors including fixed and variable expenses including the cost of crude oil ngls and other refinery and petrochemical feedstocks and the margin we can derive from selling refined and chemicals segment products the prices of feedstocks and our products fluctuate substantially these prices depend on numerous factors beyond our control including the global supply and demand for feedstocks and our products which are subject to among other things 

  

 

the price of crude oil influences prices for refined products we do not produce crude oil and must purchase all of the crude oil we process many crude oils available on the world market will not meet the quality restrictions for use in our refineries others are not economical to use due to excessive transportation costs or for other reasons the prices for crude oil and refined products can fluctuate differently based on global regional and local market conditions in addition the timing of the relative movement of the prices both among different classes of refined products and among various global markets for similar refined products as well as the overall change in refined product prices can reduce refining margins and could have a significant impact on our refining wholesale marketing and retail operations revenues operating income and cash flows also crude oil supply contracts generally have marketresponsive pricing provisions we normally purchase our refinery feedstocks weeks before manufacturing and selling the refined products during the period between the time we purchase feedstocks and sell the refined products from these feedstocks price changes could have a significant effect on our financial results we also purchase refined products produced by others for sale to our customers price changes during the periods between purchasing and selling these refined products also could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the price of feedstocks also influences prices for petrochemical and plastics products although our chemicals segment gathers transports and fractionates feedstocks to meet a portion of their demand and has certain longterm feedstock supply contracts with others it is still subject to volatile feedstock prices in addition the petrochemicals industry is both cyclical and volatile cyclicality occurs when periods of tight supply resulting in increased prices and profit margins are followed by periods of capacity expansion resulting in oversupply and declining prices and profit margins volatility occurs as a result of changes in supply and demand for products changes in energy prices and changes in various other economic conditions around the world 

uncertainty and illiquidity in credit and capital markets can impair our ability to obtain credit and financing on acceptable terms and can adversely affect the financial strength of our business partners 

our ability to obtain credit and capital depends in large measure on the state of the credit and capital markets which is beyond our control our ability to access credit and capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like or need access to those markets which could constrain our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions in addition the cost and availability of debt and equity financing may be adversely impacted by unstable or illiquid market conditions protracted uncertainty and illiquidity in these markets also could have an adverse impact on our lenders commodity hedging counterparties or our customers preventing them from meeting their obligations to us 

index to financial statements 

from time to time our cash needs may exceed our internally generated cash flow and our business could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to obtain necessary funds from financing activities from time to time we may need to supplement cash generated from operations with proceeds from financing activities uncertainty and illiquidity in financial markets may materially impact the ability of the participating financial institutions to fund their commitments to us under our liquidity facilities accordingly we may not be able to obtain the full amount of the funds available under our liquidity facilities to satisfy our cash requirements and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position 

deterioration in our credit profile could increase our costs of borrowing money and limit our access to the capital markets and commercial credit and could trigger coventurer rights under joint venture arrangements 

our or phillips 66 partners’ credit ratings could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment the circumstances warrant if a rating agency were to downgrade our rating below investment grade our or phillips 66 partners’ borrowing costs would increase and our funding sources could decrease in addition a failure by us to maintain an investment grade rating could affect our business relationships with suppliers and operating partners for example our agreement with chevron regarding cpchem permits chevron to buy our 50 percent interest in cpchem for fair market value if we experience a change in control or if both sp and moody’s lower our credit ratings below investment grade and the credit rating from either rating agency remains below investment grade for 365 days thereafter with fair market value determined by agreement or by nationally recognized investment banks as a result of these factors a downgrade of credit ratings could have a materially adverse impact on our future operations and financial position 

we expect to continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of our compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations likewise future environmental laws and regulations may impact or limit our current business plans and reduce demand for our products 

our business is subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment these laws and regulations continue to increase in both number and complexity and affect our operations with respect to among other things 

  

 

we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital operating and maintenance and remediation expenditures as a result of these laws and regulations to the extent these expenditures as with all costs are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in future periods could be materially adversely affected 

the us environmental protection agency epa has implemented a renewable fuel standard rfs pursuant to the energy policy act of 2005 and the energy independence and security act of 2007 the rfs program sets annual quotas for the quantity of renewable fuels such as ethanol that must be blended into motor fuels consumed in the united states to provide certain flexibility in compliance options available to the industry a renewable identification number rin is assigned to each gallon of renewable fuel produced in or imported into the united states as a producer of petroleumbased motor fuels we are obligated to blend renewable fuels into the products we produce at a rate that is at least commensurate to the epa’s quota and to the extent we do not we must purchase rins in the open market to satisfy our obligation under the rfs program to the extent the epa mandates a quantity of renewable fuel that exceeds the amount that is commercially feasible to blend into motor fuel a situation commonly referred to as “the blend wall” our operations could be materially adversely impacted up to and including a reduction in produced motor fuel

the adoption of climate change legislation could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the refined products we produce 

the us government including the epa as well as several state and international governments have either considered or adopted legislation or regulations in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas ghg emissions these proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in states andor countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future in addition various groups suggest that additional laws may be needed in an effort to address climate change we cannot predict the extent to which any such legislation will be enacted and if so what its provisions would be to the extent we incur additional costs required to comply with the adoption of new laws and regulations that are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in future periods could be materially adversely affected in addition demand for the refined products we produce could be adversely affected 

climate change may adversely affect our facilities and our ongoing operations 

the potential physical effects of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and depend upon the unique geographic and environmental factors present examples of such effects include rising sea levels at our coastal facilities changing storm patterns and intensities and changing temperature levels as many of our facilities are located near coastal areas rising sea levels may disrupt our ability to operate those facilities or transport crude oil and refined petroleum products extended periods of such disruption could have an adverse effect on our results of operation we could also incur substantial costs to protect or repair these facilities 

domestic and worldwide political and economic developments could damage our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows 

actions of the us state local and international governments through tax and other legislation executive order and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability both in the united states and abroad the us government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries these restrictions and those of foreign governments could limit our ability to operate in or gain access to opportunities in various countries as well as limit our ability to obtain the optimum slate of crude oil and other refinery feedstocks our foreign operations and those of our joint ventures are further subject to risks of loss of revenue equipment and property as a result of expropriation acts of terrorism war civil unrest and other political risks unilateral or forced renegotiation modification or nullification of existing contracts with governmental entities and difficulties enforcing rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations our foreign operations and those of our joint ventures are also subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates actions by both the united states and host governments may affect our operations significantly in the future 

renewable fuels alternative energy mandates and energy conservation efforts could reduce demand for refined products tax incentives and other subsidies can make renewable fuels and alternative energy more competitive with refined products than they otherwise might be which may reduce refined product margins and hinder the ability of refined products to compete with renewable fuels 

large capital projects can take many years to complete and market conditions could deteriorate significantly between the project approval date and the project startup date negatively impacting project returns 

to approve a largescale capital project the project must meet an acceptable level of return on the capital invested in the project we base these forecasted project economics on our best estimate of future market conditions most largescale projects take several years to complete during this multiyear period market conditions can change from those we forecast and these changes could be significant accordingly we may not be able to realize our expected returns from a large investment in a capital project and this could negatively impact our results of operations cash flows and our return on capital employed 

our investments in joint ventures decrease our ability to manage risk 

we conduct some of our operations including parts of our midstream refining and ms segments and our entire chemicals segment through joint ventures in which we share control with our joint venture participants our joint 

index to financial statements 

venture participants may have economic business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with those of the joint venture or us or our joint venture participants may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone failure by us or an entity in which we have a jointventure interest to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisitions or joint ventures could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our joint ventures and in turn our business and operations 

activities in our chemicals and midstream segments involve numerous risks that may result in accidents or otherwise affect the ability of our equity affiliates to make distributions to us 

there are a variety of hazards and operating risks inherent in the manufacturing of petrochemicals and the gathering processing transmission storage and distribution of natural gas and ngl such as spills leaks explosions and mechanical problems that could cause substantial financial losses in addition these risks could result in significant injury loss of human life damage to property environmental pollution and impairment of operations any of which could result in substantial losses for assets located near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers industrial sites and other public gathering areas the level of damage resulting from these risks could be greater should any of these risks materialize it could have a material adverse effect on the business and financial condition of cpchem dcp midstream or rex and negatively impact their ability to make future distributions to us 

our operations present hazards and risks which may not be fully covered by insurance if insured if a significant accident or event occurs for which we are not adequately insured our operations and financial results could be adversely affected 

the scope and nature of our operations present a variety of operational hazards and risks including explosions fires toxic emissions maritime hazards and natural catastrophes that must be managed through continual oversight and control for example the operation of refineries power plants fractionators pipelines terminals and vessels is inherently subject to the risks of spills discharges or other inadvertent releases of petroleum or hazardous substances if any of these events had previously occurred or occurs in the future in connection with any of our refineries pipelines or refined products terminals or in connection with any facilities that receive our wastes or byproducts for treatment or disposal other than events for which we are indemnified we could be liable for all costs and penalties associated with their remediation under federal state local and international environmental laws or common law and could be liable for property damage to third parties caused by contamination from releases and spills these and other risks are present throughout our operations as protection against these hazards and risks we maintain insurance against many but not all potential losses or liabilities arising from such operating risks as such our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover us against potential losses arising from such risks uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating risks could reduce the funds available to us for capital and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to interruptions of supply and increased costs as a result of our reliance on thirdparty transportation of crude oil ngl and refined products 

we often utilize the services of third parties to transport crude oil ngl and refined products to and from our facilities in addition to our own operational risks discussed above we could experience interruptions of supply or increases in costs to deliver refined products to market if the ability of the pipelines or vessels to transport crude oil or refined products is disrupted because of weather events accidents governmental regulations or thirdparty actions a prolonged disruption of the ability of a pipeline or vessel to transport crude oil ngl or refined product to or from one or more of our refineries or other facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in us production of crude oil and natural gas which could adversely impact our results of operations 

an increasing percentage of crude oil supplied to our refineries and the crude oil and gas production of our midstream segment’s customers is being produced from unconventional sources these reservoirs require hydraulic fracturing completion processes to release the hydrocarbons from the rock so they can flow through casing to the surface hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water sand and chemicals under pressure into the formation to stimulate hydrocarbon production the us environmental protection agency as well as several state agencies have commenced 

index to financial statements 

studies andor convened hearings regarding the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities at the same time certain environmental groups have suggested that additional laws may be needed to more closely and uniformly regulate the hydraulic fracturing process and legislation has been proposed to provide for such regulation in addition some communities have adopted measures to ban hydraulic fracturing in their communities we cannot predict whether any such legislation will ever be enacted and if so what its provisions would be any additional levels of regulation and permits required with the adoption of new laws and regulations at the federal or state level could result in our having to rely on higher priced crude oil for our refineries this could lead to delays increased operating costs and process prohibitions that could reduce the volumes of natural gas that move through dcp midstream’s gathering systems and could reduce supplies and increase costs of ngl feedstocks to cpchem ethylene facilities this could materially adversely affect our results of operations and the ability of dcp midstream and cpchem to make cash distributions to us 

dcp midstream’s success depends on its ability to obtain new sources of natural gas and ngl any decrease in the volumes of natural gas dcp midstream gathers could adversely affect its business and operating results 

dcp midstream’s gathering and transportation pipeline systems are connected to or dependent on the level of production from natural gas wells which will naturally decline over time as a result its cash flows associated with these wells will also decline over time in order to maintain or increase throughput levels on its gathering and transportation pipeline systems and ngl pipelines and the asset utilization rates at its natural gas processing plants dcp midstream must continually obtain new supplies the primary factors affecting dcp midstream’s ability to obtain new supplies of natural gas and ngl and to attract new customers to its assets include the level of successful drilling activity near these assets prices of and the demand for natural gas and crude oil producers’ desire and ability to obtain necessary permits in an efficient manner natural gas field characteristics and production performance surface access and infrastructure issues and its ability to compete for volumes from successful new wells if dcp midstream is not able to obtain new supplies of natural gas to replace the natural decline in volumes from existing wells or because of competition throughput on its pipelines and the utilization rates of its treating and processing facilities would decline this could have a material adverse effect on its business results of operations financial position and cash flows and its ability to make cash distributions to us 

competitors that produce their own supply of feedstocks have more extensive retail outlets or have greater financial resources may have a competitive advantage 

the refining and marketing industry is highly competitive with respect to both feedstock supply and refined product markets we compete with many companies for available supplies of crude oil and other feedstocks and for outlets for our refined products we do not produce any of our crude oil feedstocks some of our competitors however obtain a portion of their feedstocks from their own production and some have more extensive retail outlets than we have competitors that have their own production or extensive retail outlets and greater brandname recognition are at times able to offset losses from refining operations with profits from producing or retailing operations and may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages 

some of our competitors also have materially greater financial and other resources than we have such competitors have a greater ability to bear the economic risks inherent in all phases of our business in addition we compete with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel requirements of our industrial commercial and individual customers 

we may incur losses as a result of our forwardcontract activities and derivative transactions 

we currently use commodity derivative instruments and we expect to use them in the future if the instruments we utilize to hedge our exposure to various types of risk are not effective we may incur losses derivative transactions involve the risk that counterparties may be unable to satisfy their obligations to us a large percentage of our future production is subject to commodity price changes and our ability to fund our planned activities could be adversely affected if any of our counterparties were to default on their obligations to us under the hedging contracts or seek bankruptcy protection the risk of counterparty default is heightened in a poor economic environment

one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of phillips 66 partners lp a publicly traded master limited partnership our control of the general partner of phillips 66 partners may increase the possibility that we could be subject to claims of breach of fiduciary duties including claims of conflicts of interest related to phillips 66 partners any liability resulting from such claims could have a material adverse effect on our future business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a significant interruption in one or more of our facilities could adversely affect our business 

our operations could be subject to significant interruption if one or more of our facilities were to experience a major accident mechanical failure or power outage encounter work stoppages relating to organized labor issues be damaged by severe weather or other natural or manmade disaster such as an act of terrorism or otherwise be forced to shut down if any facility were to experience an interruption in operations earnings from the facility could be materially adversely affected to the extent not recoverable through insurance if insured because of lost production and repair costs a significant interruption in one or more of our facilities could also lead to increased volatility in prices for feedstocks and refined products and could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets making it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain insurance coverage that we consider adequate 

our performance depends on the uninterrupted operation of our facilities which are becoming increasingly dependent on our information technology systems 

our performance depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of the manufacturing equipment in our production facilities the inability to operate one or more of our facilities due to a natural disaster power outage labor dispute or failure of one or more of our information technology telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to manufacture our products our manufacturing equipment is becoming increasingly dependent on our information technology systems a disruption in our information technology systems due to a catastrophic event or security breach could interrupt or damage our operations 

security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability which would cause our business and reputation to suffer 

in the ordinary course of our business we collect sensitive data including personally identifiable information of our customers using credit cards at our branded retail outlets despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions although we have experienced occasional actual or attempted breaches of our cybersecurity none of these breaches has had a material effect on our business operations or reputation or compromised any customer data any such breaches could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability under laws that protect the privacy of customer information disrupt the services we provide to customers and damage our reputation any of which could adversely affect our business 

the level of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the expected return on plan assets for our pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans are evaluated by us based on a variety of independent market information and in consultation with outside actuaries if we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected longterm rate of return or health care cost trend rate our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses and funding requirements could increase in addition several factors could cause actual results to differ significantly from the actuarial assumptions that we use funding obligations are determined based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date as required under relevant regulations future pension funding requirements and the timing of funding payments could be affected by legislation enacted by governmental authorities

in connection with the separation conocophillips has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities and we have agreed to indemnify conocophillips for certain liabilities if we are required to act on these indemnities to conocophillips we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations and our financial results could be negatively impacted the conocophillips indemnity may not be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of liabilities for which it has been allocated responsibility and conocophillips may not be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future 

pursuant to the indemnification and release agreement and certain other agreements with conocophillips entered into in connection with the separation conocophillips agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities and we agreed to indemnify conocophillips for certain liabilities indemnities that we may be required to provide conocophillips are not subject to any cap may be significant and could negatively impact our business particularly indemnities relating to our actions that could impact the taxfree nature of the distribution of phillips 66 stock third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that conocophillips has agreed to retain further the indemnity from conocophillips may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities and conocophillips may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations moreover even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from conocophillips any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves each of these risks could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to continuing contingent liabilities of conocophillips following the separation 

notwithstanding the separation there are several significant areas where the liabilities of conocophillips may become our obligations for example under the internal revenue code and the related rules and regulations each corporation that was a member of the conocophillips consolidated us federal income tax reporting group during any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the effective time of the separation is jointly and severally liable for the us federal income tax liability of the entire conocophillips consolidated tax reporting group for that taxable period in connection with the separation we entered into the tax sharing agreement with conocophillips that allocates the responsibility for prior period taxes of the conocophillips consolidated tax reporting group between us and conocophillips conocophillips may be unable to pay any prior period taxes for which it is responsible and we could be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes other provisions of federal law establish similar liability for other matters including laws governing taxqualified pension plans as well as other contingent liabilities 

if the distribution in connection with the separation together with certain related transactions does not qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes our stockholders and conocophillips could be subject to significant tax liability and in certain circumstances we could be required to indemnify conocophillips for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax sharing agreement 

conocophillips received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service irs substantially to the effect that among other things the distribution together with certain related transactions qualified as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code the private letter ruling and the tax opinion that conocophillips received relied on certain representations assumptions and undertakings including those relating to the past and future conduct of our business and neither the private letter ruling nor the opinion would be valid if such representations assumptions and undertakings were incorrect moreover the private letter ruling does not address all the issues that are relevant to determining whether the distribution qualified for taxfree treatment notwithstanding the private letter ruling and the tax opinion the irs could determine the distribution should be treated as a taxable transaction for us federal income tax purposes if it determines any of the representations assumptions or undertakings that were included in the request for the private letter ruling are false or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion that are not covered by the irs ruling 

if the irs were to determine that the distribution failed to qualify for taxfree treatment in general conocophillips would be subject to tax as if it had sold the phillips 66 common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value and conocophillips stockholders who received shares of phillips 66 common stock in the distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares 

under the tax sharing agreement we would generally be required to indemnify conocophillips against any tax resulting from the distribution to the extent that such tax resulted from i any of our representations or undertakings being incorrect or violated or ii other actions or failures to act by us our indemnification obligations to conocophillips and

business environment and executive overview 

phillips 66 is an energy manufacturing and logistics company with midstream chemicals refining and marketing and specialties businesses at december 31 2015  we had total assets of 486 billion  

executive overview 

we reported earnings of 42 billion  in 2015  and generated 57 billion  in cash from operating activities phillips 66 partners lp issued 11 billion  of debt and 384 million  of its common units to the public we used available cash primarily to fund capital expenditures and investments of 58 billion  pay dividends of 12 billion  repurchase 15 billion  of our common stock and repay 800 million of senior notes that came due in 2015 we ended 2015  with 31 billion  of cash and cash equivalents and approximately 49 billion  of total capacity under our available liquidity facilities 

our financial performance in 2015 demonstrated the benefit of a diversified portfolio of businesses in a low commodity price environment we continue to focus on the following strategic priorities

business environment 

the dramatic fall in commodity prices which started during the second half of 2014 continued throughout 2015 the us oil rig count declined over 60 percent and crude oil production declined well below its peak which was set during the second quarter of 2015 additionally the discount for us benchmark west texas intermediate wti vs the international benchmark brent narrowed over the course of 2015 as logistical constraints between oil producing areas and major refining centers were incrementally removed during the year falling commodity prices have had a variety of impacts both favorable and unfavorable on our downstream businesses that vary by segment 

earnings in the midstream segment which includes our 50 percent equity investment in dcp midstream are closely linked to ngl prices natural gas prices and crude oil prices ngl prices weakened throughout 2015 as ngl production growth from liquidsrich shale plays outpaced domestic demand growth from the petrochemical industry while export capacity remained constrained—driving prices lower and pushing inventories higher natural gas prices weakened throughout 2015 as well as natural gas production growth continued and unseasonably warm weather limited demand 

  

during 2015 our chemicals segment which consists of our 50 percent equity investment in cpchem continued to benefit from feedstock cost advantages associated with manufacturing ethylene in regions of the world with significant ngl production the chemicals and plastics industry is mainly a commoditybased industry where the margins for key products are based on supply and demand as well as cost factors the petrochemicals industry continues to experience lower ethylene cash costs in regions of the world where ethylene manufacturing is based upon ngl rather than crude oilderived feedstocks in particular companies with north american light nglbased crackers have benefited from lowerpriced feedstocks however the ethylenetopolyethylene chain margins were compressed in 2015 because of the significant decline in crude oil prices that began in 2014 

our refining segment is driven by several factors including refining margins cost control refinery throughput and product yields refinery margins often referred to as crack spreads are measured as the difference between market prices for refined petroleum products and crude oil during 2015 the us 321 crack spread three barrels of crude oil producing two barrels of gasoline and one barrel of diesel improved over 2014 across all quarters largely attributable to strong gasoline crack spreads which were driven by robust demand growth both in the us and globally the diesel crack spread weakened throughout 2015 driven by growing product inventories as a result of high refinery utilization to capture robust gasoline cracks and an unseasonably warm fourth quarter the us west coast crack spread increased year over year as a result of significant refinery plannedunplanned maintenance in the region 

european refineries benefited during 2015 as domestic and export gasoline demand expanded considerably northwest european crack spreads on average increased in the first three quarters of the year and declined in the fourth quarter resulting in an average increase in 2015 compared to 2014 strong margins were driven by the strength in gasoline margins which offset subdued diesel cracks during much of the year as large volumes of imported diesel from the united states india asia pacific and russia kept diesel margins under pressure throughout the second half of the year 

results for our marketing and specialties ms segment depend largely on marketing fuel margins lubricant margins and other specialty product margins while ms margins are primarily based on market factors largely determined by the relationship between supply and demand marketing fuel margins in particular are primarily determined by the trend of spot prices for refined products generally speaking a downward trend of spot prices has a favorable impact on marketing fuel margins while an upward trend of spot prices has an unfavorable impact on marketing fuel margins

midstream 

  



 based on index prices from the mont belvieu and conway market hubs that are weighted by ngl component and location mix 



pipelines represent the sum of volumes transported through each separately tariffed pipeline segment including our share of equity volumes from yellowstone pipe line company and lake charles pipe line company 

 represents 100 percent of dcp midstream’s volumes 

excludes dcp midstream 

  

the midstream segment gathers processes transports and markets natural gas and transports fractionates and markets ngl in the united states in addition this segment transports crude oil and other feedstocks to our refineries and other locations delivers refined and specialty products to market and provides terminaling and storage services for crude oil and petroleum products the midstream segment includes our master limited partnership phillips 66 partners lp as well as our 50 percent equity investment in dcp midstream 

2015  vs 2014   

earnings from the midstream segment decreased   494 million  in 2015  compared with 2014  the decrease was primarily due to lower earnings from dcp midstream and our ngl business partially offset by higher earnings from our transportation business 

transportation earnings increased 55 million in 2015 compared with 2014 this increase reflects the startup of our bayway and ferndale crude oil rail unloading facilities in the second half of 2014 as well as a full year of operations from the beaumont terminal acquired in 2014 increased railcar fleet activities higher terminal revenues and improved earnings from equity affiliates also benefited earnings in 2015 these benefits were partially offset by higher earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests 

index to financial statements 

earnings associated with our investment in dcp midstream decreased 459 million in 2015 compared with 2014 the decrease in 2015 mainly resulted from lower ngl crude oil and natural gas prices partially offset by increased volumes due to asset growth and lower operating costs as a result of cost saving initiatives in addition goodwill and other asset impairments recorded by dcp midstream in 2015 contributed to the loss recognized from our investment in dcp midstream dcp midstream performed a goodwill impairment assessment and other asset impairment assessments based on internal discounted cash flow models taking into account various observable and nonobservable factors such as prices volumes expenses and discount rates the impairment tests resulted in dcp midstream’s recognition of a 460 million goodwill impairment and  342 million in other asset impairments net of tax impacts together these impairments reduced our equity earnings from dcp midstream   by 232 million aftertax 

dcp midstream partners lp dcp partners a master limited partnership formed by dcp midstream periodically issues limited partner units to the public these issuances benefited our equity in earnings from dcp midstream on an aftertax basis by approximately 1 million in 2015 compared with approximately 45 million in 2014 

the earnings from our ngl business decreased 90 million in 2015 compared with 2014 the decrease was primarily driven by lower realized margins and higher earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests we also incurred higher tax expense in 2015 driven by a lower manufacturing deduction resulting from bonus depreciation associated with the startup of sweeny fractionator one these decreases were partially offset by higher earnings from equity affiliates 

see the “business environment and executive overview” section for information on market factors impacting this year’s results 

as previously disclosed in early 2015 we and our coventurer in dcp midstream agreed to forgo cash distributions from dcp midstream due to the significant decrease in commodity prices since mid2014 the sustained weak commodity price environment during 2015 caused dcp midstream to impair its goodwill in 2015 by 460 million and impair certain assets and inprocess capital projects in the fourth quarter of 2015 by an additional 342 million to strengthen its balance sheet during the fourth quarter of 2015 we contributed 15 billion of cash to dcp midstream while our coventurer contributed its interests in certain operating assets held as equity investments at december 31 2015 the carrying value of our investment in dcp midstream was approximately 23 billion we will continue to monitor dcp midstream’s operations and the continued weak commodity price environment for any further impacts on dcp midstream or the carrying value of our investment 

2014  vs 2013    

earnings from the midstream segment increased 38 million in 2014 compared with 2013 the improvement was primarily driven by higher earnings from our transportation and ngl businesses partially offset by lower earnings from dcp midstream 

transportation earnings increased 34 million in 2014 compared with 2013 this increase primarily resulted from increased throughput fees as well as higher earnings associated with railcar activity in 2014 these increases were partially offset by higher earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests reflecting the contribution of previously wholly owned assets to phillips 66 partners 

the 75 million decrease in earnings of dcp midstream in 2014 primarily resulted from a decrease in ngl and crude prices in the latter part of 2014 ngl and crude prices have continued to decline in the early part of 2015 in addition earnings decreased as costs associated with asset growth and maintenance increased in 2014 compared with 2013 earnings further declined due to dcp midstream’s contribution of assets to dcp partners following the contribution a percentage of the earnings from these assets are attributable to public unitholders thus decreasing income attributable to dcp midstream and thereby phillips 66 see the “business environment and executive overview” section for additional information on market factors impacting dcp midstream’s results 

dcp partners unit issuances benefited our equity in earnings from dcp midstream on an aftertax basis by approximately 45 million in 2014 compared with approximately 62 million in 2013 

index to financial statements 

earnings from the ngl business increased 79 million compared with 2013 the increase was primarily due to improved margins driven by strong propane prices in early 2014 additionally 2014 earnings benefited from gains related to seasonal propane and butane storage activity also earnings improved due to higher equity earnings from dcp sand hills llc sand hills and dcp southern hills llc southern hills these increases were partially offset by an increase in costs associated with growth projects 

chemicals 

  



the chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in cpchem which we account for under the equity method cpchem uses ngl and other feedstocks to produce petrochemicals these products are then marketed and sold or used as feedstocks to produce plastics and other chemicals we structure our reporting of cpchem’s operations around two primary business segments olefins and polyolefins op and specialties aromatics and styrenics sas the op business segment produces and markets ethylene and other olefin products ethylene produced is primarily consumed within cpchem for the production of polyethylene normal alpha olefins and polyethylene pipe the sas business segment manufactures and markets aromatics and styrenics products such as benzene styrene paraxylene and cyclohexane as well as polystyrene and styrenebutadiene copolymers sas also manufactures andor markets a variety of specialty chemical products unless otherwise noted amounts referenced below reflect our net 50 percent interest in cpchem 

2015  vs 2014   

earnings from the chemicals segment decreased   175 million  or 15 percent  in 2015  compared with 2014  the decrease in earnings was primarily due to lower margins resulting from lower sales prices lower earnings from cpchem’s op equity affiliates and higher turnaround and maintenance activities 

these decreases were partially offset by higher ethylene and polyethylene sales volumes as well as lower repair costs due to the impact on 2014 costs of the fire at cpchem’s port arthur texas facility lower feedstock costs lower utility costs due to falling natural gas prices and lower impairment charges also benefited the 2015 operating results 

in july 2014 a localized fire occurred in the olefins unit at cpchem’s port arthur texas facility shutting down ethylene production the port arthur ethylene unit restarted in november 2014 cpchem incurred on a 100 percent basis 85 million of associated repair and rebuild costs because the port arthur ethylene unit was down due to the fire cpchem experienced a significant reduction in production and sales in several of its product lines stemming from the lack of the port arthur ethylene supply in 2014 cpchem recorded earnings on a 100 percent basis of 88 million and 120 million for business interruption and property damage insurance proceeds in 2015 and 2014 respectively

2014  vs 2013 

earnings from the chemicals segment increased 151 million or 15 percent in 2014 compared with 2013 the increase in earnings was primarily driven by improved ethylene and polyethylene realized margins due to higher sales prices additionally chemicals benefited from higher equity earnings from cpchem’s op equity affiliates 

these increases were partially offset by lower ethylene and polyethylene sales volumes and increased costs related to the port arthur facility fire in addition impairments of 69 million aftertax in 2014 further offset a portion of the increase to earnings

refining 

  



index to financial statements 

the refining segment buys sells and refines crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products such as gasoline distillates and aviation fuels at 14  refineries mainly in the united states and europe 

2015  vs 2014   

earnings for the refining segment increased 784 million  or 44 percent  compared with 2014  the increase in earnings in 2015  primarily resulted from higher realized refining margins due to higher gasoline crack spreads and improved secondary product margins as well as lower utility costs these increases were partially offset by lower feedstock advantage lower distillate crack spreads lower clean product differentials and lower refining volumes as a result of higher unplanned downtime and turnaround activities 

see the “business environment and executive overview” section for information on industry crack spreads and other market factors impacting this year’s results 

our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 91 percent  in 2015  compared to 94 percent  in 2014  the decrease reflects higher unplanned downtime and turnaround activities 

effective january 1 2015 we aligned the results of the activities previously included in “other refining” into the atlantic basineurope gulf coast central corridor and westernpacific refining regions there were no changes to the consolidated refining operating segment as a result of this alignment the new alignment is presented for the year ended december 31 2015 with the prior periods retrospectively adjusted for comparability 

2014  vs 2013   

earnings for the refining segment were 1771 million in 2014 an increase of 24 million or 1 percent compared with 2013 the slight increase in earnings in 2014 was primarily due to higher realized refining margins related to secondary products as well as increased volumes in addition earnings were impacted by a gain on disposition and a related deferred tax adjustment associated with the sale of mrc together totaling 369 million aftertax 

these increases were mostly offset by 

 

our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 94 percent in 2014 compared to 93 percent in 2013 the increase reflects lower unplanned downtime related to power outages that occurred in the gulf coast region in 2013

marketing and specialties 

  



the ms segment purchases for resale and markets refined petroleum products such as gasoline distillates and aviation fuels mainly in the united states and europe in addition this segment includes the manufacturing and marketing of specialty products such as base oils and lubricants as well as power generation operations 

2015  vs 2014   

earnings from the ms segment increased   153 million  or 15 percent  in 2015  compared with 2014  in july 2013 we completed the sale of ichp and deferred the gain from the sale due to an indemnity provided to the buyer we recognized 242 million aftertax and 126 million aftertax of the deferred gain in 2015 and 2014 respectively 

earnings from the ms segment also benefited from higher domestic marketing activities higher domestic marketing and lubricants volumes and increased tax credits from biodiesel blending activities these benefits were partially offset by lower international marketing margins and lubricants margins 

see the “business environment and executive overview” section for information on marketing fuel margins and other market factors impacting 2015 results 

index to financial statements 

2014  vs 2013 

earnings from the ms segment increased 140 million or 16 percent in 2014 compared with 2013 both us and international marketing margins benefited from the timing effect of falling gasoline prices experienced in the second half of 2014 us marketing also benefited from a full year of consignment agreements entered into in 2013 while international marketing margins also benefited from foreign exchange gains in 2014 

in 2014 we recognized 126 million aftertax of the deferred gain related to the sale in 2013 of the ichp increasing earnings these increases were partially offset by the lack of ichp earnings in 2014 compared with earnings of 53 million in 2013 

corporate and other 

  



2015  vs 2014 

net interest expense consists of interest and financing expense net of interest income and capitalized interest net interest expense increased   26 million  in 2015  compared with 2014  primarily due to a higher average debt principal balance as a result of the issuance of debt in the fourth quarter of 2014 and phillips 66 partners’ debt issuance in the first quarter of 2015 the increase was partially offset by higher capitalized interest for additional information see note 13—debt  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the category “other” includes certain income tax expenses environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation foreign currency transaction gains and losses and other costs not directly associated with an operating segment the increase in costs in 2015 was primarily due to foreign tax credit carryforwards that were utilized in 2014 and other tax adjustments made in 2015 

2014  vs 2013 

net interest expense decreased 6 million in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to increased capitalized interest this decrease in expense was partially offset due to an increase in average debt outstanding in 2014 reflecting the issuance of debt in late 2014 for additional information see note 13—debt  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

corporate general and administrative expenses increased 11 million in 2014 compared with 2013 the increase was primarily due to increased employee benefit costs and charitable contributions 

the decrease in other costs was primarily due to increased utilization of foreign tax credit carryforwards in addition higher environmental costs negatively affected our 2013 results

capital resources and liquidity 

financial indicators 



to meet our short and longterm liquidity requirements we look to a variety of funding sources including cash generated from operating activities and phillips 66 partners’ debt and equity financings during 2015  we generated 57 billion  in cash from operations and received 11 billion from phillips 66 partners’ issuance of senior notes and 04 billion from the issuance of phillips 66 partners’ common units to the public we used available cash primarily for capital expenditures and investments  58 billion  including a contribution to dcp midstream 15 billion debt repayments  09 billion  repurchases of our common stock  15 billion  and dividend payments on our common stock  12 billion  during 2015  cash and cash equivalents decreased  by 21 billion  to 31 billion  

in addition to cash flows from operating activities we rely on our commercial paper and credit facility programs asset sales and our ability to issue securities using our shelf registration statement to support our short and longterm liquidity requirements we believe current cash and cash equivalents and cash generated by operations together with access to external sources of funds as described below under “significant sources of capital” will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near and long term including our capital spending dividend payments defined benefit plan contributions debt repayment and share repurchases 

significant sources of capital 

operating activities 

during 2015  cash of  5713 million  was provided by operating activities a 62 percent   increase  over 2014  net income in 2015 was lower than 2014 however in both years large noncash items affected earnings including the gain on the pspi exchange in 2014 recognition in 2015 and 2014 of a deferred gain from a 2013 asset disposition and goodwill and other asset impairments by dcp midstream in 2015 excluding these items underlying earnings in 2015 were slightly improved compared with 2014 primarily reflecting increased refining margins and increased domestic marketing volumes partially offset by lower midstream prices negative working capital impacted operating cash flow by 221 million and 1020 million in 2015 and 2014 respectively the lower negative working capital impact in 2015 was driven by decreased refining payables due to lower feedstock costs in 2015 as compared with 2014 partially offset by a reduction in receivables due to reduced commodity prices see the following paragraph for a discussion of 2014 working capital effects 

during 2014  cash of  3529 million  was provided by operating activities a 41 percent   decrease  from cash from operations of  6027 million  in 2013  although net income was higher in 2014 than in 2013 certain large noncash items benefitted 2014 earnings including the gain on the pspi exchange gains from asset dispositions and the deferred tax effects of certain asset dispositions excluding these items underlying earnings in 2014 were similar to 2013 however working capital negatively impacted 2014 operating cash flow by 1020 million compared with a positive impact of 880 million in 2013 working capital impacts in 2014 reflected the negative impact of lower commodity prices on accounts payable with a lesser positive impact on accounts receivable as we generally carry higher payables on our 

index to financial statements 

balance sheet than receivables by comparison accounts payable activity increased cash from operations by 360 million in 2013 reflecting both higher volumes and commodity prices while lower refining margins reflecting less favorable market conditions and tightening of crude differentials negatively impacted 2013 working capital benefiting 2014 operating cash flow compared with 2013 was the receipt of a special distribution from wrb of which 760 million was considered an operating cash flow partially offset by lower distributions from cpchem 

our short and longterm operating cash flows are highly dependent upon refining and marketing margins ngl prices and chemicals margins prices and margins in our industry are typically volatile and are driven by market conditions over which we have little or no control absent other mitigating factors as these prices and margins fluctuate we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows 

the level and quality of output from our refineries also impacts our cash flows factors such as operating efficiency maintenance turnarounds market conditions feedstock availability and weather conditions can affect output we actively manage the operations of our refineries and any variability in their operations typically has not been as significant to cash flows as that caused by margins and prices our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization was 91 percent  in 2015  compared with 94 percent in 2014  we expect 2016  utilization to be in the mid 90percent range 

equity affiliates 

our operating cash flows are also impacted by distribution decisions made by our equity affiliates including dcp midstream cpchem and wrb over the three years ended december 31 2015  we received distributions of 452 million  from dcp midstream 2879 million  from cpchem and  2938 million  from wrb we cannot control the amount or timing of future distributions from equity affiliates therefore future distributions by these and other equity affiliates are not assured we and our coventurer in dcp midstream have agreed to forgo distributions from dcp midstream during the current lowcommodity price environment 

during the second quarter of 2015 cpchem made a special distribution to its owners with our share totaling 696 million cpchem funded the distribution by issuing 14 billion of senior notes with maturities ranging from three to five years with a combination of fixed and variable interest rates this cash inflow from cpchem was included in operating cash flows as we had cumulative undistributed equity earnings attributable to cpchem in excess of the amount distributed 

wrb is a 50percentowned business venture with cenovus energy inc cenovus cenovus was obligated to contribute 75 billion plus accrued interest to wrb over a 10year period that began in 2007 in 2014 cenovus prepaid its remaining balance under this obligation as a result wrb declared a special dividend which was distributed to the coventurers in 2014 of the 1232 million that we received 760 million was considered a return on our investment in wrb an operating cash inflow and 472 million was considered a return of our investment in wrb an investing cash inflow the returnofinvestment portion of the dividend was included in the “proceeds from asset dispositions” line in our consolidated statement of cash flows a further 129 million of distributions from wrb during 2014 was considered a return of investment 

asset sales 

net proceeds from asset sales in 2015  were  70 million  compared with  1244 million  in 2014  and  1214 million  in 2013  the 2015 net proceeds were attributed to the sale of the bantry bay terminal in ireland and the sale of certain retail sites in kansas and missouri and were partially offset by a working capital trueup related to the 2014 sale of our interest in mrc the 2014 proceeds included a portion of the wrb special dividend as discussed above as well as the sale of our interest in mrc the 2013 proceeds included the sale of a power plant in the united kingdom as well as our gasification technology 

foreign cash holdings 

at december 31 2015 approximately 44 percent of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents balance was available to fund domestic opportunities without incurring material additional us income taxes in excess of the amounts already accrued in the financial statements we believe the remaining amount primarily attributable to cash we hold in foreign locations where we have asserted our intention to indefinitely reinvest earnings does not materially affect our consolidated liquidity due to the following factors 

index to financial statements 

 

see note 21—income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on income taxes associated with foreign earnings 

income taxes 

as part of our normal tax administrative process we made scheduled us federal income tax payments in 2015 using the internal revenue service irs safe harbor method for estimated 2015 taxable income we determined that a portion of those payments is refundable as an overpayment of estimated tax primarily due to us tax legislation enacted late in the year and we filed a refund claim with the irs in the first quarter of 2016 we expect this refund to benefit cash from operations in the first quarter of 2016 by approximately 590 million

chemicals 

during the threeyear period ended december 31 2015  cpchem had a selffunded capital program and thus required no new capital infusions from us or our coventurer during this period on a 100 percent basis cpchem’s capital expenditures and investments were 56 billion in addition cpchem’s advances to equity affiliates primarily used for project construction and startup activities were 03 billion and its repayments received from equity affiliates were 01 billion  

refining 

capital spending for the refining segment during the threeyear period ended december 31 2015  was 29 billion  primarily for air emission reduction and clean fuels projects to meet new environmental standards refinery upgrade projects to increase accessibility of advantaged crudes and improve product yields improvements to the operating integrity of key processing units and safetyrelated projects 

key projects completed during the threeyear period included 

 

major construction activities in progress include 

 

generally our equity affiliates in the refining segment are intended to have selffunding capital programs during this threeyear period on a 100 percent basis wrb’s capital expenditures and investments were 09 billion  we expect wrb’s 2016  capital program to be selffunding 

marketing and specialties 

capital spending for the ms segment during the threeyear period ended december 31 2015  was primarily for the acquisition of and investments in a limited number of retail sites in the western and midwestern portions of the united states which have subsequently been disposed of the acquisition of spectrum corporation a private label specialty lubricants business headquartered in memphis tennessee the acquisition of the remaining interest that we did not already own in an entity that operates a power and steam generation plant reliability and maintenance projects and projects targeted at growing our international marketing business 

corporate and other 

capital spending for corporate and other during the threeyear period ended december 31 2015  was primarily for projects related to information technology and facilities 

2016  budget 

our 2016  capital budget is 39 billion including phillips 66 partners’ c apital budget of 03 billion this excludes our portion of planned capital spending by joint ventures dcp midstream cpchem and wrb totaling 14 billion  all of which are expected to be selffunded 

index to financial statements 

the midstream capital budget of 23 billion is focused on growth projects such as continued construction of the 150000 barrelsperday freeport lpg export terminal on the us gulf coast the new dapl and etcop pipeline projects expansion of the beaumont terminal and the bayou bridge pipeline project 

refining’s capital budget of 12 billion is directed toward reliability safety and environmental projects including compliance with the new tier 3 gasoline specifications as well as projects designed to improve product yields and lower feedstock costs 

in marketing and specialties we plan to invest approximately 01 billion for growth and sustaining capital the growth investment reflects our continued plans to expand and enhance our fuel marketing business 

in corporate and other we plan to fund approximately 02 billion in projects primarily related to information technology and facilities 

contingencies 

a number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims that arose in the ordinary course of business have been filed against us or are subject to indemnifications provided by us we also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement storage disposal or release of certain chemical mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites we regularly assess the need for financial recognition or disclosure of these contingencies in the case of all known contingencies other than those related to income taxes we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable if a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount then the minimum of the range is accrued we do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or thirdparty recoveries if applicable we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other thirdparty recoveries in the case of incometaxrelated contingencies we use a cumulative probabilityweighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain 

based on currently available information we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements as we learn new facts concerning contingencies we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include contingent liabilities recorded for environmental remediation tax and legal matters estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other potentially responsible parties estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes 

legal and tax matters 

our legal and tax matters are handled by our legal and tax organizations these organizations apply their knowledge experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases and uncertain tax positions we employ a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases and enables the tracking of those cases that have been scheduled for trial andor mediation based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals or establishment of new accruals is required in the case of incometaxrelated contingencies we monitor tax legislation and court decisions the status of tax audits and the statute of limitations within which a taxing authority can assert a liability see note 21—income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about incometaxrelated contingencies 

environmental 

we are subject to the same numerous international federal state and local environmental laws and regulations as other companies in our industry the most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include among others the 

  

 

index to financial statements 

 these laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and in the case of discharges to water establish water quality limits they also in most cases require permits in association with new or modified operations these permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process which can be expensive and time consuming in addition there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency’s processing of the application many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant 

many states and foreign countries where we operate also have or are developing similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities while similar in some cases these regulations may impose additional or more stringent requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders 

the ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards such as air emission standards water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations continue to evolve however environmental laws and regulations including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the united states and in other countries in which we operate notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the united states 

an example of this in the fuels area is the energy policy act of 2005 which imposed obligations to provide increasing volumes of renewable fuels in transportation motor fuels through 2012 these obligations were changed with the enactment of the energy independence and security act of 2007 eisa eisa requires fuel producers and importers to provide additional renewable fuels for transportation motor fuels and stipulates a mix of various types to be included through 2022 we have met the increasingly stringent requirements to date while establishing implementation operating and capital strategies along with advanced technology development to address projected future requirements it is uncertain how various future requirements contained in eisa and the regulations promulgated thereunder may be implemented and what their full impact may be on our operations for the 2016 compliance year the us environmental protection agency epa will require greater volumes of advanced and total renewable fuel than mandated in previous years it is uncertain if these increased obligations will be achievable by fuel producers and shippers without drawing on the renewable identification number rin bank for compliance years after 2016 we do not know whether the epa will utilize its authority to reduce statutory volumes additionally we may experience a decrease in demand for refined petroleum products due to the regulatory program as currently promulgated this program continues to be the subject of possible congressional review and repromulgation in revised form and the epa’s recently enacted regulations pertaining to the 2014 2015 and 2016 compliance years are subject to legal challenge further creating uncertainty regarding renewable fuel volume requirements and obligations 

the epa’s renewable fuel standard rfs program was also implemented in accordance with the energy policy act of 2005 and eisa the rfs program sets annual quotas for the percentage of biofuels such as ethanol that must be blended into motor fuels consumed in the united states a rin represents a serial number assigned to each gallon of biofuel produced or imported into the united states as a producer of petroleumbased motor fuels we are obligated to 

index to financial statements 

blend biofuels into the products we produce at a rate that is at least equal to the epa’s quota and to the extent we do not we must purchase rins in the open market to satisfy our obligation under the rfs program the market for rins has been the subject of fraudulent activity and we have identified that we have unknowingly purchased rins in the past that were invalid due to fraudulent activity of third parties costs to replace fraudulently marketed rins that have been determined to be invalid have not been material through december 31 2015  however it is reasonably possible that some additional rins that we have previously purchased may also be determined to be invalid should that occur we could incur additional replacement charges although the cost for replacing any additional fraudulently marketed rins is not reasonably estimable at this time we could have a possible exposure of approximately 150 million before tax it could take several years for this possible exposure to reach ultimate resolution therefore we would not expect to incur the full financial impact of additional fraudulent rins replacement costs in any single interim or annual period 

we also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations such laws and regulations include cercla and rcra and their state equivalents remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility arising from petroleum releases from underground storage tanks located at numerous past and present owned andor operated petroleummarketing outlets throughout the united states federal and state laws require contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards in addition to other cleanup standards many states have adopted cleanup criteria for methyl tertiarybutyl ether mtbe for both soil and groundwater 

at rcrapermitted facilities we are required to assess environmental conditions if conditions warrant we may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations in contrast to cercla which is often referred to as “superfund” the cost of corrective action activities under rcra corrective action programs typically is borne solely by us we anticipate increased expenditures for rcra remediation activities may be required but such annual expenditures for the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures we have experienced over the past few years longerterm expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly 

we occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the epa and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under cercla or an equivalent state statute on occasion we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties these requests notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations as of december 31 2014  we reported that we had been notified of potential liability under cercla and comparable state laws at 34 sites within the united states during 2015  we were notified of four new sites settled and closed one site and resolved one site leaving 36 unresolved sites with potential liability at december 31 2015  

for most superfund sites our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties is relatively low although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations and where they have not or where potentially responsible parties could not be located our share of liability has not increased materially many of the sites for which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the epa or the state agencies concerned prior to actual cleanup those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation in some instances we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain epa or equivalent state agency approval of a remediation plan there are relatively few sites where we are a major participant and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all cercla sites in the aggregate is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition 

expensed environmental costs were 581 million  in 2015  and are expected to be approximately 655 million  in each of the years 2016  and 2017  capitalized environmental costs were 330 million  in 2015  and are expected to be approximately 235 million  in each of the years 2016  and 2017  this amount does not include capital expenditures made for another purpose that have an indirect benefit on environmental compliance 

accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted except those assumed in a purchase business combination which we record on a discounted basis 

index to financial statements 

many of these liabilities result from cercla rcra and similar state laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct or once conducted operations or at sites where our generated waste was disposed we also have accrued for a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation but which are not currently the subject of cercla rcra or state enforcement activities if applicable we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other thirdparty recoveries in the future we may incur significant costs under both cercla and rcra remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site depending on the mix of unique site characteristics evolving remediation technologies diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties therefore it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs 

at december 31 2015  our balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of 485 million  compared with 496 million  at december 31 2014  and 492 million  at december 31 2013  we expect to incur a substantial amount of these expenditures within the next 30 years 

notwithstanding any of the foregoing and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in our operations and products and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred however we currently do not expect any material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations 

climate change 

there has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state national and international laws focusing on greenhouse gas ghg emissions reduction including various regulations proposed or issued by the epa these proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in states andor countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future we consider and take into account future ghg emissions in designing and developing major facilities and projects and implement energy efficiency initiatives to reduce such emissions laws regulating ghg emissions continue to evolve and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation such laws if enacted potentially could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition as a result of increasing costs of compliance lengthening project implementation and agency review items or reducing demand for certain hydrocarbon products examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include 

  

 

in the eu the first phase of the eu ets completed at the end of 2007 and phase ii was undertaken from 2008 through to 2012 the current phase phase iii runs from 2013 through to 2020 with the main changes being reduced allocation of 

index to financial statements 

free allowances and increased auctioning of new allowances phillips 66 has assets that are subject to the eu ets and the company is actively engaged in minimizing any financial impact from the eu ets 

from november 30 to december 12 2015 more than 190 countries including the united states participated in the united nations climate change conference in paris france the conference culminated in what is known as the “paris agreement” which is currently open for agreement by countries until april 22 2016 the paris agreement establishes a commitment by signatory parties to pursue domestic ghg emission reductions 

in the united states some additional form of regulation is likely to be forthcoming in the future at the federal or state levels with respect to ghg emissions such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes the restriction of output investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances we are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations 

compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a ghg emission trading program or ghg reduction requirements could significantly increase our costs reduce demand for fossil energy derived products impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources an example of one such program is california’s cap and trade program which was promulgated pursuant to the state’s global warming solutions act the program had been limited to certain stationary sources which include our refineries in california but beginning in january 2015 expanded to include emissions from transportation fuels distributed in california inclusion of transportation fuels in california’s cap and trade program as currently promulgated has increased our cap and trade program compliance costs the ultimate impact on our financial performance either positive or negative from this and similar programs will depend on a number of factors including but not limited to 

  

 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses see note 1—summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for descriptions of our major accounting policies certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions or if different assumptions had been used the following discussion of critical accounting estimates along with the discussion of contingencies in this report address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions could be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change 

impairments 

longlived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows is expected to be generated by an asset group if upon review the sum of the undiscounted pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group including applicable 

index to financial statements 

liabilities the carrying value of the longlived assets included in the asset group is written down to estimated fair value individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets for example at a refinery complex level because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for longlived assets the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined using one or more of the following methods the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants a market multiple of earnings for similar assets or historical market transactions of similar assets adjusted using principal market participant assumptions when necessary the expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future volumes commodity prices operating costs margins discount rates and capital project decisions considering all available information at the date of review 

investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are reviewed for impairment when there are indicators of a loss in value such as a lack of sustained earnings capacity or a current fair value less than the investment’s carrying amount when it is determined that an indicated impairment is other than temporary a charge is recognized for the difference between the investment’s carrying value and its estimated fair value 

when determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline the investee’s financial condition and nearterm prospects and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that allows for recovery when quoted market prices are not available the fair value is usually based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants and a market analysis of comparable assets if appropriate differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period 

asset retirement obligations 

under various contracts permits and regulations we have legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land at the end of operations at certain operational sites our largest asset removal obligations involve asbestos abatement at refineries estimating the timing and amount of payments for future asset removal costs is difficult most of these removal obligations are many years or decades in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs asset removal technologies and costs regulatory and other compliance considerations expenditure timing and other inputs into valuation of the obligation including discount and inflation rates are also subject to change 

environmental costs 

in addition to asset retirement obligations discussed above under the above or similar contracts permits and regulations we have certain obligations to complete environmentalrelated projects these projects are primarily related to cleanup at domestic refineries underground storage sites and nonoperated sites future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties 

intangible assets and goodwill 

at december 31 2015  we had 770 million  of intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives and thus they are not amortized this judgmental assessment of an indefinite useful life must be continuously evaluated in the future if due to changes in facts and circumstances management determines these intangible assets have finite useful lives amortization will commence at that time on a prospective basis as long as these intangible assets are judged to have indefinite lives they will be subject to annual impairment tests that require management’s judgment of the estimated fair value of these intangible assets 

at december 31 2015  we had 33 billion  of goodwill recorded in conjunction with past business combinations goodwill is not amortized instead goodwill is subject to at least annual reviews for impairment at a reporting unit level the reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed a reporting unit is an operating segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment 

index to financial statements 

because quoted market prices for our reporting units are not available management applies judgment in determining the estimated fair values of the reporting units for purposes of performing the goodwill impairment test management uses all available information to make this fair value determination including observed market earnings multiples of comparable companies our common stock price and associated total company market capitalization and the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks associated with the assets sales or dispositions of significant assets within a reporting unit are allocated a portion of that reporting unit’s goodwill based on relative fair values which impacts the amount of gain or loss on the sale or disposition 

we completed our annual impairment test as of october 1 2015 and concluded that the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their recorded net book values including goodwill the fair values of each of our refining transportation and ms reporting units exceeded their respective recorded net book values by over 100 percent however a decline in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units in the future could result in an impairment for example a prolonged or significant decline in our stock price or a significant decline in actual or forecasted earnings could provide evidence of a significant decline in fair value and a need to record a material impairment of goodwill for one or more of our reporting units after we’ve completed our annual test we continue to monitor for impairment indicators which can lead to further goodwill impairment testing 

tax assets and liabilities 

our operations are subject to various taxes including federal state and foreign income taxes property taxes and transactional taxes such as excise salesuse and payroll taxes we record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations the recording of tax liabilities requires significant judgment and estimates we recognize the financial statement effects of an income tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority a contingent liability related to a transactional tax claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and estimable actual incurred tax liabilities can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons including different interpretations of tax laws and regulations and different assessments of the amount of tax due 

in determining our income tax provision we assess the likelihood our deferred tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income valuation allowances reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized judgment is required in estimating the amount of valuation allowance if any that should be recorded against our deferred tax assets based on our historical taxable income our expectations for the future and available taxplanning strategies we expect the net deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as reductions to future taxable income if our actual results of operations differ from such estimates or our estimates of future taxable income change the valuation allowance may need to be revised 

new tax laws and regulations as well as changes to existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being proposed or promulgated the implementation of future legislative and regulatory tax initiatives could result in increased tax liabilities that cannot be predicted at this time 

projected benefit obligations 

determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans impacts the obligations on the balance sheet and the amount of benefit expense in the income statement the actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events including estimated retirement dates salary levels at retirement mortality rates lumpsum election rates rates of return on plan assets future health care costtrend rates and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees due to the specialized nature of these calculations we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects ultimately we will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions a 1 percentagepoint decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by an estimated 60 million while a 1 percentagepoint decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by an estimated 30 million in determining the discount rate we use yields on highquality fixed income investments with payments matched to the estimated distributions of benefits from our plans

in 2015 and 2014 the company used an expected longterm rate of return of 7 percent for the us pension plan assets which account for 73 percent of the company’s pension plan assets the actual asset returns were a loss of less than 1 percent in 2015 and a gain of 9 percent in 2014 for the past ten years actual returns averaged 7 percent for the us pension plan assets 

new accounting standards 

in january 2016 the fasb issued accounting standard update asu no 201601 “financial instrumentsoverall subtopic 82510” to meet its objective of providing more decisionuseful information about financial instruments the majority of this asu’s provisions amend only the presentation or disclosures of financial instruments however one provision will also affect net income equity investments carried under the cost method or lower of cost or fair value method of accounting in accordance with current generally accepted accounting principles will have to be carried at fair value upon adoption of asu 201601 with changes in fair value recorded in net income for equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values a company may elect to carry such investments at cost less impairments if any adjusted up or down for price changes in similar financial instruments issued by the investee when and if observed public business entities should apply the guidance in asu 201601 for annual periods beginning after december 15 2017 and interim periods within those annual periods with early adoption prohibited we are currently evaluating the provisions of asu 201601 and assessing the impact if any it may have on our financial position and results of operations 

in november 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201517 “income taxes  balance sheet classification of deferred taxes” the new update will simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes and will require deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position the classification shall be made at the taxpaying component level of an entity after reflecting any offset of deferred tax liabilities deferred tax assets and any related valuation allowances public business entities should apply the guidance in asu 201517 for annual periods beginning after december 15 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods early application for public entities is permitted the amendments can be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented we are currently evaluating the provisions of asu 201517 

in june 2014 the fasb issued asu 201410 “development stage entities topic 915” the new standard removes the definition of a development stage entity from the master glossary of accounting standard codification and the related financial reporting requirements specific to development stage entities this asu is intended to reduce cost and complexity of financial reporting for entities that have not commenced planned principal operations for financial reporting requirements other than the vie guidance in asc topic 810 “consolidation” asu 201410 was effective for annual and quarterly reporting periods of public entities beginning after december 15 2014 for the financial reporting requirements related to vies in asc topic 810 “consolidation” asu 201410 is effective for annual and quarterly reporting periods of public entities beginning after december 15 2015 early application for public entities is permitted we are currently evaluating the provisions of asu 201410 our preliminary assessment indicates that additional disclosures related to vies may be required for our joint ventures if the planned principal operations have not commenced 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers topic 606” the new standard converged guidance on recognizing revenues in contracts with customers under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and international financial reporting standards this asu is intended to improve comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities industries jurisdictions and capital markets in august 2015 the fasb issued asu 201514 “revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 deferral of the effective date” the amendment in this asu defers the effective date of asu 201409 for all entities for one year public business entities should apply the guidance in asu 201409 to annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 including interim reporting periods within that reporting period earlier adoption is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after december 31 2016 including interim reporting periods within that reporting period retrospective or modified retrospective application of the accounting standard is required we are currently evaluating the provisions of asu 201409 and assessing the impact if any it may have on our financial position and results of operations as part of our assessment work todate we have formed an implementation work team completed training of the new asu’s revenue recognition model and begun contract review and documentation

during 2014 final board of directors approval was received on the sweeny fractionator one and freeport lpg export terminal projects these two projects represent an estimated investment of more than 3 billion as part of the company’s midstream growth program 

the sweeny fractionator one is located in old ocean texas close to our sweeny refinery and will supply ngl products to the petrochemical industry and heating markets raw ngl supply to the fractionator is expected from nearby major pipelines including the sand hills pipeline the 100000 barrelperday ngl fractionator is expected to start up in the second half of 2015 

the freeport lpg export terminal is located at the site of our existing marine terminal in freeport texas and will leverage our midstream transportation and storage infrastructure to supply petrochemical heating and transportation markets globally the terminal will have an initial export capacity of 44 million barrels per month with a ship loading rate of 36000 barrels per hour startup of the export terminal is expected in the second half of 2016 

index to financial statements 

each of these projects will include ngl storage and additional pipelines with connectivity to market hubs in mont belvieu texas also included with these projects is a 100000 barrelperday deethanizer unit that will be installed close to the sweeny refinery to upgrade domestic propane for export 

to support these facilities we are also installing significant infrastructure including connectivity to three ngl supply pipelines a new salt dome storage facility with an initial 6 million barrels of underground storage expandable to 32 million barrels and a 180000 barrelperday bidirectional pipeline connecting sweeny to the mont belvieu market center in support of these projects we have successfully secured longterm feebased commitments for the majority of the feedstocks and products for sweeny fractionator one 

in response to the challenging market conditions driven by the recent decline in global crude oil prices we have delayed the timing of investment decisions on a secondphase of midstream projects in texas including our plans to build a second ngl fractionator a crude and condensate pipeline and a condensate splitter 

chemicals 

the chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in cpchem which is headquartered in the woodlands texas at the end of 2014  cpchem owned or had jointventure interests in 34 manufacturing facilities and two research and development centers located around the world

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form 10k each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock 

our operating results and future rate of growth are exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices and refining petrochemical and plastics margins 

our revenues operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent on a number of factors including fixed and variable expenses including the cost of crude oil ngls and other refinery and petrochemicals feedstocks and the margin relative to those expenses at which we are able to sell refined and chemicals segment products during the last half of 2014 and other periods in recent years the prices of feedstocks and our products have fluctuated substantially these prices depend on numerous factors beyond our control including the global supply and demand for feedstocks and our products which are subject to among other things 

  

 

the price of crude oil influences prices for refined products we do not produce crude oil and must purchase all of the crude oil we process many crude oils available on the world market will not meet the quality restrictions for use in our refineries others are not economical to use due to excessive transportation costs or for other reasons the prices for crude oil and refined products can fluctuate differently based on global regional and local market conditions in addition the timing of the relative movement of the prices both among different classes of refined products and among various global markets for similar refined products as well as the overall change in refined product prices can reduce refining margins and could have a significant impact on our refining wholesale marketing and retail operations revenues operating income and cash flows also crude oil supply contracts generally have marketresponsive pricing provisions we normally purchase our refinery feedstocks weeks before manufacturing and selling the refined products price level changes during the period between purchasing feedstocks and selling the refined products from these feedstocks could have a significant effect on our financial results we also purchase refined products produced by others for sale to our customers price level changes during the periods between purchasing and selling these refined products also could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the price of feedstocks also influences prices for petrochemical and plastics products although our chemicals segment gathers transports and fractionates feedstocks to meet a portion of their demand and has certain longterm feedstock supply contracts with others it is still subject to volatile feedstock prices in addition the petrochemicals industry is both cyclical and volatile cyclicality occurs when periods of tight supply resulting in increased prices and profit margins are followed by periods of capacity expansion resulting in oversupply and declining prices and profit margins volatility occurs as a result of changes in supply and demand for products changes in energy prices and changes in various other economic conditions around the world 

uncertainty and illiquidity in credit and capital markets can impair our ability to obtain credit and financing on acceptable terms and can adversely affect the financial strength of our business partners 

our ability to obtain credit and capital depends in large measure on the state of the credit and capital markets which is beyond our control our ability to access credit and capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like or need access to those markets which could constrain our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions in addition the cost and availability of debt and equity financing may be adversely impacted by unstable or illiquid market conditions protracted uncertainty and illiquidity in these markets also could have an adverse impact on our lenders commodity hedging counterparties or our customers preventing them from meeting their obligations to us 

index to financial statements 

from time to time our cash needs may exceed our internally generated cash flow and our business could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to obtain necessary funds from financing activities from time to time we may need to supplement our cash generated from operations with proceeds from financing activities uncertainty and illiquidity in financial markets may materially impact the ability of the participating financial institutions to fund their commitments to us under our liquidity facilities accordingly we may not be able to obtain the full amount of the funds available under our liquidity facilities to satisfy our cash requirements and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position 

deterioration in our credit profile could increase our costs of borrowing money and limit our access to the capital markets and commercial credit and could trigger coventurer rights under joint venture arrangements 

our credit ratings could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment the circumstances warrant if a rating agency were to downgrade our rating below investment grade our borrowing costs would increase and our funding sources could decrease in addition a failure by us to maintain an investment grade rating could affect our business relationships with suppliers and operating partners for example our agreement with chevron regarding cpchem permits chevron to buy our 50 percent interest in cpchem for fair market value if we experience a change in control or if both sp and moody’s lower our credit ratings below investment grade and the credit rating from either rating agency remains below investment grade for 365 days thereafter with fair market value determined by agreement or by nationally recognized investment banks as a result of these factors a downgrade of our credit ratings could have a materially adverse impact on our future operations and financial position 

we expect to continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of our compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations likewise future environmental laws and regulations may impact or limit our current business plans and reduce demand for our products 

our business is subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment these laws and regulations continue to increase in both number and complexity and affect our operations with respect to among other things 

  

 

we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital operating and maintenance and remediation expenditures as a result of these laws and regulations to the extent these expenditures as with all costs are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in future periods could be materially adversely affected 

the us environmental protection agency epa has implemented a renewable fuel standard rfs pursuant to the energy policy act of 2005 and the energy independence and security act of 2007 the rfs program sets annual quotas for the quantity of renewable fuels such as ethanol that must be blended into motor fuels consumed in the united states to provide certain flexibility in compliance options available to the industry a renewable identification number rin is assigned to each gallon of renewable fuel produced in or imported into the united states as a producer of petroleumbased motor fuels we are obligated to blend renewable fuels into the products we produce at a rate that is at least commensurate to the epa’s quota and to the extent we do not we must purchase rins in the open market to satisfy our obligation under the rfs program to the extent the epa mandates a quantity of renewable fuel that exceeds the amount that is commercially feasible to blend into motor fuel a situation commonly referred to as “the blend wall” our operations could be materially adversely impacted up to and including a reduction in produced motor fuel 

index to financial statements 

climate change may adversely affect our facilities and our ongoing operations 

the potential physical effects of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and depend upon the unique geographic and environmental factors present examples of such effects include rising sea levels at our coastal facilities changing storm patterns and intensities and changing temperature levels as many of our facilities are located near coastal areas rising sea levels may disrupt our ability to operate those facilities or transport crude oil and refined petroleum products extended periods of such disruption could have an adverse effect on our results of operation we could also incur substantial costs to protect or repair these facilities 

domestic and worldwide political and economic developments could damage our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows 

actions of the us state local and international governments through tax and other legislation executive order and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability both in the united states and abroad the us government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries these restrictions and those of foreign governments could limit our ability to operate in or gain access to opportunities in various countries as well as limit our ability to obtain the optimum slate of crude oil and other refinery feedstocks our foreign operations and those of our joint ventures are further subject to risks of loss of revenue equipment and property as a result of expropriation acts of terrorism war civil unrest and other political risks unilateral or forced renegotiation modification or nullification of existing contracts with governmental entities and difficulties enforcing rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations our foreign operations and those of our joint ventures are also subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates actions by both the united states and host governments may affect our operations significantly in the future 

renewable fuels alternative energy mandates and energy conservation efforts could reduce demand for refined products tax incentives and other subsidies can make renewable fuels and alternative energy more competitive with refined products than they otherwise might be which may reduce refined product margins and hinder the ability of refined products to compete with renewable fuels 

large capital projects can take many years to complete and market conditions could deteriorate significantly between the project approval date and the project startup date negatively impacting project returns 

to approve a largescale capital project the project must meet an acceptable level of return on the capital invested in the project we base these forecasted project economics on our best estimate of future market conditions most largescale projects take several years to complete during this multiyear period market conditions can change from those we forecast and these changes could be significant accordingly we may not be able to realize our expected returns from a large investment in a capital project and this could negatively impact our results of operations cash flows and our return on capital employed 

our investments in joint ventures decrease our ability to manage risk 

we conduct some of our operations including parts of our midstream refining and ms segments and our entire chemicals segment through joint ventures in which we share control with our joint venture participants our joint venture participants may have economic business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with those of the joint venture or us or our joint venture participants may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone failure by us or an entity in which we have a jointventure interest to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisitions or joint ventures could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our joint ventures and in turn our business and operations 

activities in our chemicals and midstream segments involve numerous risks that may result in accidents or otherwise affect the ability of our equity affiliates to make distributions to us 

there are a variety of hazards and operating risks inherent in the manufacturing of petrochemicals and the gathering processing transmission storage and distribution of natural gas and ngl such as spills leaks explosions and mechanical problems that could cause substantial financial losses in addition these risks could result in significant injury loss of human life damage to property environmental pollution and impairment of operations any of which could 

index to financial statements 

result in substantial losses for assets located near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers industrial sites and other public gathering areas the level of damage resulting from these risks could be greater should any of these risks materialize it could have a material adverse effect on the business and financial condition of cpchem dcp midstream or rex and negatively impact their ability to make future distributions to us 

our operations present hazards and risks which may not be fully covered by insurance if insured if a significant accident or event occurs for which we are not adequately insured our operations and financial results could be adversely affected 

the scope and nature of our operations present a variety of operational hazards and risks including explosions fires toxic emissions maritime hazards and natural catastrophes that must be managed through continual oversight and control for example the operation of refineries power plants fractionators pipelines terminals and vessels is inherently subject to the risks of spills discharges or other inadvertent releases of petroleum or hazardous substances if any of these events had previously occurred or occurs in the future in connection with any of our refineries pipelines or refined products terminals or in connection with any facilities that receive our wastes or byproducts for treatment or disposal other than events for which we are indemnified we could be liable for all costs and penalties associated with their remediation under federal state local and international environmental laws or common law and could be liable for property damage to third parties caused by contamination from releases and spills these and other risks are present throughout our operations as protection against these hazards and risks we maintain insurance against many but not all potential losses or liabilities arising from such operating risks as such our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover us against potential losses arising from such risks uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating risks could reduce the funds available to us for capital and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to interruptions of supply and increased costs as a result of our reliance on thirdparty transportation of crude oil ngl and refined products 

we often utilize the services of third parties to transport crude oil ngl and refined products to and from our facilities in addition to our own operational risks discussed above we could experience interruptions of supply or increases in costs to deliver refined products to market if the ability of the pipelines or vessels to transport crude oil or refined products is disrupted because of weather events accidents governmental regulations or thirdparty actions a prolonged disruption of the ability of a pipeline or vessel to transport crude oil ngl or refined product to or from one or more of our refineries or other facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in us production of crude oil and natural gas which could adversely impact our results of operations 

an increasing percentage of crude oil supplied to our refineries and the crude oil and gas production of our midstream segment’s customers is being developed from unconventional sources such as deep oil and gas shales these reservoirs require hydraulic fracturing completion processes to release the hydrocarbons from the rock so they can flow through casing to the surface hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water sand and chemicals under pressure into the formation to stimulate hydrocarbon production the us environmental protection agency as well as several state agencies have commenced studies andor convened hearings regarding the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities at the same time certain environmental groups have suggested that additional laws may be needed to more closely and uniformly regulate the hydraulic fracturing process and legislation has been proposed to provide for such regulation in addition some communities have adopted measures to ban hydraulic fracking in their communities we cannot predict whether any such legislation will ever be enacted and if so what its provisions would be any additional levels of regulation and permits required with the adoption of new laws and regulations at the federal or state level could result in our having to rely on higher priced crude oil for our refineries and lead to delays increased operating costs and process prohibitions that could reduce the volumes of natural gas that move through dcp midstream’s gathering systems and could reduce supplies and increase costs of ngl feedstocks to cpchem ethylene facilities this could materially adversely affect our results of operations and the ability of dcp midstream and cpchem to make cash distributions to us 

index to financial statements 

because of the natural decline in production from existing wells in dcp midstream’s areas of operation its success depends on its ability to obtain new sources of natural gas and ngl any decrease in the volumes of natural gas dcp midstream gathers could adversely affect its business and operating results 

dcp midstream’s gathering and transportation pipeline systems are connected to or dependent on the level of production from natural gas wells from which production will naturally decline over time as a result its cash flows associated with these wells will also decline over time in order to maintain or increase throughput levels on its gathering and transportation pipeline systems and ngl pipelines and the asset utilization rates at its natural gas processing plants dcp midstream must continually obtain new supplies the primary factors affecting dcp midstream’s ability to obtain new supplies of natural gas and ngl and to attract new customers to its assets include the level of successful drilling activity near these assets pricing of and the demand for natural gas and crude oil producers’ desire and ability to obtain necessary permits in an efficient manner natural gas field characteristics and production performance surface access and infrastructure issues and its ability to compete for volumes from successful new wells if dcp midstream is not able to obtain new supplies of natural gas to replace the natural decline in volumes from existing wells or because of competition throughput on its pipelines and the utilization rates of its treating and processing facilities would decline this could have a material adverse effect on its business results of operations financial position and cash flows and its ability to make cash distributions to us 

competitors that produce their own supply of feedstocks have more extensive retail outlets or have greater financial resources may have a competitive advantage 

the refining and marketing industry is highly competitive with respect to both feedstock supply and refined product markets we compete with many companies for available supplies of crude oil and other feedstocks and for outlets for our refined products we do not produce any of our crude oil feedstocks some of our competitors however obtain a portion of their feedstocks from their own production and some have more extensive retail outlets than we have competitors that have their own production or extensive retail outlets and greater brandname recognition are at times able to offset losses from refining operations with profits from producing or retailing operations and may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages 

some of our competitors also have materially greater financial and other resources than we have such competitors have a greater ability to bear the economic risks inherent in all phases of our business in addition we compete with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel requirements of our industrial commercial and individual customers 

we may incur losses as a result of our forwardcontract activities and derivative transactions 

we currently use commodity derivative instruments and we expect to continue their use in the future if the instruments we utilize to hedge our exposure to various types of risk are not effective we may incur losses derivative transactions involve the risk that counterparties may be unable to satisfy their obligations to us if any of our counterparties were to default on its obligations to us under the hedging contracts or seek bankruptcy protection it could have an adverse effect on our ability to fund our planned activities and could result in a larger percentage of our future production being subject to commodity price changes the risk of counterparty default is heightened in a poor economic environment 

one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of a publicly traded master limited partnership phillips 66 partners lp which may involve a greater exposure to legal liability than our historic business operations 

one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of phillips 66 partners lp a publicly traded master limited partnership our control of the general partner of phillips 66 partners may increase the possibility that we could be subject to claims of breach of fiduciary duties including claims of conflicts of interest related to phillips 66 partners any liability resulting from such claims could have a material adverse effect on our future business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

index to financial statements 

a significant interruption in one or more of our facilities could adversely affect our business 

our operations could be subject to significant interruption if one or more of our facilities were to experience a major accident mechanical failure or power outage encounter work stoppages relating to organized labor issues be damaged by severe weather or other natural or manmade disaster such as an act of terrorism or otherwise be forced to shut down if any facility were to experience an interruption in operations earnings from the facility could be materially adversely affected to the extent not recoverable through insurance if insured because of lost production and repair costs a significant interruption in one or more of our facilities could also lead to increased volatility in prices for feedstocks and refined products and could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets making it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain insurance coverage that we consider adequate 

our performance depends on the uninterrupted operation of our facilities which are becoming increasingly dependent on our information technology systems 

our performance depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of the manufacturing equipment in our production facilities the inability to operate one or more of our facilities due to a natural disaster power outage labor dispute or failure of one or more of our information technology telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to manufacture our products our manufacturing equipment is becoming increasingly dependent on our information technology systems a disruption in our information technology systems due to a catastrophic event or security breach could interrupt or damage our operations 

security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability which would cause our business and reputation to suffer 

in the ordinary course of our business we collect sensitive data including personally identifiable information of our customers using credit cards at our branded retail outlets despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions although we have experienced occasional actual or attempted breaches of our cybersecurity none of these breaches has had a material effect on our business operations or reputation or compromised any customer data any such breaches could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability under laws that protect the privacy of customer information disrupt the services we provide to customers and damage our reputation any of which could adversely affect our business 

the level of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the expected return on plan assets for our pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans are evaluated by us in consultation with outside actuaries if we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected longterm rate of return or health care cost trend rate our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses and funding requirements could increase in addition several factors could cause actual results to differ significantly from the actuarial assumptions that we use funding obligations are determined based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date as required under relevant regulations future pension funding requirements and the timing of funding payments could be affected by legislation enacted by governmental authorities

notwithstanding the separation there are several significant areas where the liabilities of conocophillips may become our obligations for example under the internal revenue code and the related rules and regulations each corporation that was a member of the conocophillips consolidated us federal income tax reporting group during any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the effective time of the separation is jointly and severally liable for the us federal income tax liability of the entire conocophillips consolidated tax reporting group for that taxable period in connection with the separation we entered into the tax sharing agreement with conocophillips that allocates the responsibility for prior period taxes of the conocophillips consolidated tax reporting group between us and conocophillips conocophillips may be unable to pay any prior period taxes for which it is responsible and we could be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes other provisions of federal law establish similar liability for other matters including laws governing taxqualified pension plans as well as other contingent liabilities 

if the distribution in connection with the separation together with certain related transactions does not qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes our stockholders and conocophillips could be subject to significant tax liability and in certain circumstances we could be required to indemnify conocophillips for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax sharing agreement 

conocophillips received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service irs substantially to the effect that among other things the distribution together with certain related transactions qualified as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code the private letter ruling and the tax opinion that conocophillips received relied on certain representations assumptions and undertakings including those relating to the past and future conduct of our business and neither the private letter ruling nor the opinion would be valid if such representations assumptions and undertakings were incorrect moreover the private letter ruling does not address all the issues that are relevant to determining whether the distribution qualified for taxfree treatment notwithstanding the private letter ruling and the tax opinion the irs could determine the distribution should be treated as a taxable transaction for us federal income tax purposes if it determines any of the representations assumptions or undertakings that were included in the request for the private letter ruling are false or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion that are not covered by the irs ruling 

if the irs were to determine that the distribution failed to qualify for taxfree treatment in general conocophillips would be subject to tax as if it had sold the phillips 66 common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value and conocophillips stockholders who received shares of phillips 66 common stock in the distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares 

under the tax sharing agreement we would generally be required to indemnify conocophillips against any tax resulting from the distribution to the extent that such tax resulted from i an acquisition of all or a portion of our stock or assets whether by merger or otherwise ii other actions or failures to act by us or iii any of our representations or 

index to financial statements 

undertakings being incorrect or violated our indemnification obligations to conocophillips and its subsidiaries officers and directors are not limited by any maximum amount if we are required to indemnify conocophillips or such other persons under the circumstances set forth in the tax sharing agreement we may be subject to substantial liabilities

business environment and executive overview 

phillips 66 is an energy manufacturing and logistics company with midstream chemicals refining and marketing and specialties businesses at december 31 2014  we had total assets of 487 billion  

the separation 

on april 4 2012 the conocophillips board of directors approved the separation of its downstream businesses into an independent publicly traded company named phillips 66 in accordance with the separation and distribution agreement the two companies were separated by conocophillips distributing to its stockholders all 625272302 shares of common stock of phillips 66 after the market closed on april 30 2012 the separation each conocophillips stockholder received one share of phillips 66 stock for every two shares of conocophillips stock following the separation conocophillips retained no ownership interest in phillips 66 and each company has separate public ownership boards of directors and management 

executive overview 

in 2014  we reported earnings of 48 billion  generated 35 billion  in cash from operating activities and received 12 billion  from asset dispositions primarily reflecting the sale of our interest in the malaysian refining company sdn bdh mrc and a special distribution from wrb refining we used available cash primarily to fund capital expenditures and investments of 38 billion  pay dividends of 11 billion  repurchase 23 billion  of our common stock and finance 450 million  of the phillips specialty products inc pspi share exchange we issued 25 billion  of debt and ended 2014  with 52 billion  of cash and cash equivalents and approximately 49 billion  of total capacity under our available liquidity facilities

we continue to focus on the following strategic priorities 

 

 

in 2013 we formed phillips 66 partners a master limited partnership to own operate develop and acquire primarily feebased crude oil refined petroleum product and ngl pipelines and terminals as well as other transportation and midstream assets its assets consist of crude oil and refined petroleum product pipeline terminal and storage systems in the central and gulf coast regions of the united states as well as two crude oil railunloading facilities located at or adjacent to our bayway and ferndale refineries

business environment 

the midstream segment includes our 50 percent equity investment in dcp midstream earnings of dcp midstream are closely linked to ngl prices natural gas prices and crude oil prices industry ngl annual average prices decreased from 2012 to 2013 and again from 2013 to 2014 due to relatively higher inventories driven by growing ngl production from liquidsrich shale plays with limited corresponding domestic demand increase from the petrochemical industry and constrained export capacity natural gas prices increased from 2012 to 2013 and continued to increase from 2013 to 2014 the increase in both periods reflected concerns over increasingly lower industry inventory levels due to steep inventory draws in 2013 and 2014 as well as domestic pipeline constraints 

the chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in cpchem the chemicals and plastics industry is mainly a commoditybased industry where the margins for key products are based on market factors the chemicals and plastics industry continued to experience higher ethylene margins in regions of the world where production is based upon ngl versus crudederived feedstocks in particular companies with north american ethanebased crackers benefited from the lowerpriced feedstocks and improved ethylene margins as well as improved margins for polyethylene and other ethylene derivatives 

results for our refining segment depend largely on refining margins cost control refinery throughput and product yields the crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined petroleum products and crude oil and it is used within our industry as an indicator for refining margins the us 321 crack spread three barrels of crude oil producing two barrels of gasoline and one barrel of diesel decreased from 2012 to 2013 however for the first three quarters of 2014 the us crack spread improved over 2013 primarily resulting from increased access to advantaged crude runs and a decrease in imports midcontinent refiners were especially strong which was attributed to the region’s crude feedstock advantage the decrease in us crack spreads during the fourth quarter of 2014 was significant enough to drive the annual domestic industry average for 2014 lower than 2013 this decrease was largely due to gasoline prices falling faster than crude prices resulting in a tighter margin 

us crude production continues to increase and nationwide growth is benefiting from slower decline rates in legacy production areas as well as improved drilling efficiency limited infrastructure for takeaway options resulted in favorable feedstock prices for us refiners with access to advantaged crudes midcontinent refiners were especially advantaged sustained pressure on inventories and lack of local gathering infrastructure in the midcontinent caused west texas intermediate wti crude to continue trading at a discount relative to crudes such as light louisiana sweet lls and brent during 2014 refineries capable of processing wti crude and crude oils that price relative to wti primarily the midcontinent and gulf coast refineries benefited from these lower regional feedstock prices the spread between wti and brent narrowed considerably over the year stemming from increased pipeline outlets from cushing to the gulf coast as well as the gradual over supply of light crude in the atlantic basin 

the northwest europe benchmark crack spread decreased from 2012 to 2013 in 2014 the crack spread increased in the first three quarters of the year and then declined in the fourth quarter resulting in an average decrease in 2014 compared to 2013 the decline in benchmark crack spread was due to lower european domestic and export product demand on weak refinery economics while large volumes of imported diesel from the united states india asia pacific and russia kept prices under pressure weak domestic european demand and reduced export markets for gasoline compounded the declining product crack spreads 

results for our ms segment depend largely on marketing fuel margins lubricant margins and other specialty product margins these margins are primarily based on market factors largely determined by the relationship between demand and supply marketing fuel margins are primarily determined by the trend of the spot prices for refined products generally a downward trend of spot prices has a favorable impact on marketing fuel margins while an upward trend of spot prices has an unfavorable impact on marketing fuel margins crude oil prices declined significantly during 2014 which resulted in the expected benefit to marketing margins

 based on index prices from the mont belvieu and conway market hubs that are weighted by ngl component and location mix 



pipelines represent the sum of volumes transported through each separately tariffed pipeline segment including our share of equity volumes from yellowstone pipe line company and lake charles pipe line company 

 includes 100 percent of dcp midstream’s volumes 

excludes dcp midstream 

  

the midstream segment purchases raw natural gas from producers and gathers natural gas through an extensive network of pipeline gathering systems the natural gas is then processed to extract ngl from the raw gas stream the remaining “residue” gas is marketed to electric utilities industrial users and gas marketing companies most of the ngls are fractionated—separated into individual components such as ethane propane and butane—and marketed as chemical feedstock fuel or blendstock in addition the midstream segment includes us transportation pipeline terminaling and refining logistics services associated with the movement of crude oil refined and specialty products natural gas and ngl as well as ngl fractionation trading and marketing businesses in the united states the midstream segment includes our 50 percent equity investment in dcp midstream and the consolidated results of phillips 66 partners lp 

2014  vs 2013   

earnings from the midstream segment increased   38 million  in 2014  compared with 2013  the improvement was primarily driven by higher earnings from our transportation and ngl businesses partially offset by lower earnings from dcp midstream 

transportation earnings increased 34 million in 2014 compared with 2013 this increase primarily resulted from increased throughput fees as well as higher earnings associated with railcar activity in 2014 these increases were partially offset by higher earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests reflecting the contribution of previously wholly owned assets to phillips 66 partners 

index to financial statements 

the 75 million decrease in earnings of dcp midstream in 2014 primarily resulted from a decrease in ngl and crude prices in the latter part of 2014 ngl and crude prices have continued to decline in the early part of 2015 in addition earnings decreased as costs associated with asset growth and maintenance increased in 2014 compared with 2013 earnings further declined due to dcp midstream’s contribution of assets to its publicly traded master limited partnership dcp partners following the contribution a percentage of the earnings from these assets are attributable to public unitholders thus decreasing income attributable to dcp midstream and thereby phillips 66 see the “business environment and executive overview” section for additional information on market factors impacting dcp midstream’s results 

dcp partners issues from time to time limited partner units to the public these issuances benefited our equity in earnings from dcp midstream on an aftertax basis by approximately 45 million in 2014 compared with approximately 62 million in 2013 

the ngl business had an increase in earnings of 79 million compared with 2013 the increase was primarily due to improved margins driven by strong propane prices in early 2014 additionally 2014 earnings benefited from gains related to seasonal propane and butane storage activity also earnings improved due to higher equity earnings from the dcp sand hills and dcp southern hills pipeline entities these increases were partially offset by an increase in costs associated with growth projects 

2013  vs 2012   

earnings from the midstream segment increased 417 million in 2013 compared with 2012 the improvement was primarily driven by higher earnings from our transportation business and dcp midstream partially offset by lower earnings from ngl 

transportation earnings increased 409 million in 2013 compared with 2012 these increases primarily resulted from lower impairments in 2013 as well as increased throughput fees in 2012 we recorded impairments totaling 303 million aftertax on our equity investment in rex primarily reflecting a diminished view of fair value of westtoeast natural gas transmission due to the impact of shale gas production in the northeast for additional information on the rex impairment see note 11—impairments  in the notes to consolidated financial statements throughput fees were higher in 2013 primarily due to the implementation of marketbased intersegment transfer prices for transportation and terminaling services during 2013 

the 31 million increase in earnings of dcp midstream in 2013 primarily resulted from an increase in gains associated with unit issuances by dcp partners as described below in addition higher natural gas and crude oil prices benefitted earnings these increases were partially offset by lower ngl prices and higher interest expense 

dcp partners unit issuances benefited our equity in earnings from dcp midstream on an aftertax basis by approximately 62 million in 2013 compared with approximately 24 million in 2012 

ngl decreased 23 million in 2013 compared with 2012 the decrease was primarily due to inventory impacts reflecting inventory reductions in 2012 in anticipation of the separation which caused liquidations of lifo inventory values

chemicals 

  



the chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in cpchem which we account for under the equity method cpchem uses ngl and other feedstocks to produce petrochemicals these products are then marketed and sold or used as feedstocks to produce plastics and other chemicals cpchem’s business is structured around two primary operating segments olefins and polyolefins op and specialties aromatics and styrenics sas the op segment produces and markets ethylene and other olefin products ethylene produced is primarily consumed within cpchem for the production of polyethylene normal alpha olefins and polyethylene pipe the sas segment manufactures and markets aromatics products such as benzene styrene paraxylene and cyclohexane as well as polystyrene and styrenebutadiene copolymers sas also manufactures andor markets a variety of specialty chemical products unless otherwise noted amounts referenced below reflect our net 50 percent interest in cpchem 

2014  vs 2013   

earnings from the chemicals segment increased   151 million  or 15 percent  in 2014  compared with 2013  the increase in earnings was primarily driven by improved ethylene and polyethylene realized margins due to higher sales prices additionally chemicals benefited from higher equity earnings from cpchem’s op equity affiliates 

these increases were partially offset by lower ethylene and polyethylene sales volumes and increased costs related to the port arthur facility fire in addition impairments of 69 million aftertax in 2014 further offset a portion of the increase to earnings see the “business environment and executive overview” section for information on market factors impacting cpchem’s results 

in july 2014 a localized fire occurred in the olefins unit at cpchem’s port arthur texas facility shutting down ethylene production the port arthur ethylene unit restarted in november cpchem incurred on a 100 percent basis 85 million of associated repair and rebuild costs because the port arthur ethylene unit was down due to the fire cpchem experienced a significant reduction in production and sales in several of its product lines stemming from the lack of the port arthur ethylene supply cpchem’s property damage and business interruption insurance coverage limited the potential extent of the financial impact in the fourth quarter of 2014 cpchem reached an agreement with insurers and recognized into income 120 million related to advanced payments against its business interruption insurance claim

2013  vs 2012 

cpchem continued to benefit from priceadvantaged ngl feedstocks in 2013 due to the location of its manufacturing facilities in the us gulf coast and middle east earnings from the chemicals segment increased 163 million or 20 percent in 2013 compared with 2012 the increase in earnings was primarily driven by 

 

these increases were partially offset by lower olefins sales volumes related to ethylene outages in addition increased turnaround and maintenance activity resulted in lower volumes and higher costs

refining 

  



index to financial statements 

the refining segment buys sells and refines crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products such as gasoline distillates and aviation fuels at 14  refineries mainly in the united states and europe 

2014  vs 2013   

earnings for the refining segment were 1771 million  in 2014  an increase of 24 million  or 1 percent  compared with 2013  the slight increase in earnings in 2014  was primarily due to higher realized refining margins related to secondary products as well as increased volumes in addition earnings were impacted by a gain on disposition and a related deferred tax adjustment associated with the sale of mrc together totaling 369 million aftertax 

these increases were mostly offset by 

 

see the “business environment and executive overview” section for information on industry crack spreads and other market factors impacting this year’s results 

our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 94 percent in 2014  compared to 93 percent in 2013  the increase reflects lower unplanned downtime related to power outages that were experienced in the gulf coast region in 2013 

2013  vs 2012   

earnings for the refining segment were 1747 million in 2013 a decrease of 1344 million or 43 percent compared with 2012 the decrease in earnings in 2013 was primarily due to lower realized refining margins as a result of a 16 percent reduction in market cracks and impacts related to lower feedstock advantage in addition to margins refining results were also impacted by a 104 million aftertax gain from the sale of the trainer refinery and associated terminal and pipeline assets in 2012 these decreases were partially offset by reduced impairments recorded in 2012 primarily related to mrc and wrg 

our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 93 percent in both 2013 and 2012 as the lack of weather disruptions were offset by higher turnaround activities

the ms segment purchases for resale and markets refined petroleum products such as gasoline distillates and aviation fuels mainly in the united states and europe in addition this segment includes the manufacturing and marketing of specialty products such as base oils and lubricants as well as power generation operations 

2014  vs 2013   

earnings from the ms segment increased   140 million  or 16 percent  in 2014  compared with 2013  see the “business environment and executive overview” section for information on marketing fuel margins and other market factors impacting this year’s results 

both us and international marketing margins benefited from the timing effect of falling gasoline prices experienced in the second half of 2014 us marketing also benefited from a full year of consignment agreements entered into in 2013 while international marketing margins also benefited from foreign exchange gains in 2014 

in july 2013 we completed the sale of ichp and deferred the gain from the sale due to an indemnity provided to the buyer in 2014 we recognized 126 million  aftertax of the previously deferred gain increasing earnings these increases were partially offset by the lack of ichp earnings in 2014 compared with earnings of 53 million  in 2013 

looking forward absent claims under the ichp indemnity we expect the remaining deferred gain at december 31 2014 of 243 million  to be recognized in ms’s earnings in the first and second quarters of 2015 in addition if the spot prices of gasoline stabilize or begin to increase in 2015 we would expect a reduction in ms’s margins in 2015 relative to 2014

2013  vs 2012 

earnings from the ms segment increased 350 million or 64 percent in 2013 compared with 2012 

during 2013 us marketing margins benefited from higher renewable identification numbers rins values associated with renewable fuels blending activities particularly during the first three quarters rin prices decreased during the fourth quarter as concerns over their availability eased somewhat based on anticipated actions by the us environmental protection agency the increased rin prices offset weaker underlying components of our us marketing margins during 2013 

  

ms earnings benefited from higher international marketing margins in 2013 as well as an aftertax gain of 23 million from the sale of our egas tm technology business earnings in 2012 were lowered by income taxes associated with foreign dividends and 2012 included a full year of earnings from our uk power generation business which was sold in july 2013 

corporate and other 

  



2014  vs 2013 

net interest expense consists of interest and financing expense net of interest income and capitalized interest net interest expense decreased   6 million  in 2014  compared with 2013  primarily due to increased capitalized interest this decrease in expense was partially offset due to an increase in average debt outstanding in 2014 reflecting the issuance of debt in late 2014 for additional information see note 14—debt  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

corporate general and administrative expenses increased   11 million  in 2014  compared with 2013  the increase was primarily due to increased employee benefit costs and charitable contributions 

the category “other” includes certain income tax expenses environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation foreign currency transaction gains and losses and other costs not directly associated with an operating segment the decrease in costs was primarily due to increased utilization of foreign tax credit carryforwards in addition our results in 2013 were negatively impacted by higher environmental costs 

index to financial statements 

2013  vs 2012 

net interest expense increased 18 million in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to increased average debt outstanding in 2013 reflecting the issuance of debt in early 2012 in connection with the separation for additional information see note 14—debt  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

corporate general and administrative expenses increased 29 million in 2013 compared with 2012 the increase was primarily due to incremental costs and expenses associated with operating as a standalone company repositioning costs decreased 55 million in 2013 compared with 2012

capital resources and liquidity 

financial indicators 



to meet our short and longterm liquidity requirements we look to a variety of funding sources but rely primarily on cash generated from operating activities during 2014  we generated 35 billion  in cash from operations and received 12 billion  from asset dispositions including return of investments in equity affiliates and 25 billion in proceeds from the issuance of debt available cash was primarily used for capital expenditures and investments  38 billion  repurchases of our common stock  23 billion  the pspi share exchange 05 billion and dividend payments on our common stock  11 billion  during 2014 cash and cash equivalents decreased  by 02 billion  to 52 billion  

in addition to cash flows from operating activities we rely on our commercial paper and credit facility programs asset sales and our ability to issue securities using our shelf registration statement to support our short and longterm liquidity requirements we believe current cash and cash equivalents and cash generated by operations together with access to external sources of funds as described below under “significant sources of capital” will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near and long term including our capital spending dividend payments defined benefit plan contributions debt repayment and share repurchases 

significant sources of capital 

operating activities 

although net income was higher in 2014 than in 2013 there were large noncash items benefiting 2014 earnings including the gain on the pspi exchange gains from asset dispositions and the deferred tax effects of certain asset dispositions after consideration of these items underlying earnings in 2014 were similar to 2013 however working capital negatively impacted 2014 operating cash flow by 1020 million compared with a positive impact of 880 million in 2013 working capital impacts in 2014 reflected the negative impact of lower commodity prices on accounts payable with a lesser positive impact on accounts receivable as we generally carry higher payables on our balance sheet than receivables see the following paragraph for a discussion of 2013 working capital effects benefiting 2014 operating cash flow compared with 2013 was the receipt of a special distribution from wrb of which 760 million was considered an operating cash flow partially offset by lower distributions from cpchem 

during 2013  cash of  6027 million  was provided by operating activities a 40 percent   increase  from cash from operations of  4296 million  in 2012  the increase  in 2013 primarily reflected positive working capital impacts accounts payable activity increased cash from operations by 360 million in 2013 reflecting both higher volumes and commodity prices by comparison lower commodity prices and volumes reduced accounts payable by 985 million in 2012 our distributions from cpchem increased over 500 million in 2013 compared with 2012 reflecting the completion of cpchem’s debt repayments in 2012 which allowed increased dividends to us and our coventurer partially offsetting the positive impact of working capital changes in 2013 were lower refining margins during 2013 reflecting less favorable market conditions and tightening crude differentials 

index to financial statements 

our short and longterm operating cash flows are highly dependent upon refining and marketing margins ngl prices and chemicals margins prices and margins in our industry are typically volatile and are driven by market conditions over which we have little or no control absent other mitigating factors as these prices and margins fluctuate we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows 

the level and quality of output from our refineries also impacts our cash flows the output at our refineries is impacted by such factors as operating efficiency maintenance turnarounds market conditions feedstock availability and weather conditions we actively manage the operations of our refineries and typically any variability in their operations has not been as significant to cash flows as that caused by margins and prices our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization was 94 percent in 2014  compared with 93 percent in 2013  we are forecasting 2015  utilization to remain in the low 90percent range 

our operating cash flows are also impacted by distribution decisions made by our equity affiliates including dcp midstream cpchem and wrb over the three years ended december 31 2014  we received distributions of 654 million  from dcp midstream 1948 million  from cpchem and  4220 million  from wrb we cannot control the amount or timing of future distributions from equity affiliates therefore future distributions by these and other equity affiliates are not assured we and our coventurer in dcp midstream have agreed to forgo distributions from dcp midstream during the current lowcommodityprice environment 

wrb 

wrb is a 50percentowned business venture with cenovus energy inc cenovus cenovus was obligated to contribute 75 billion plus accrued interest to wrb over a 10year period that began in 2007 in 2014 cenovus prepaid its remaining balance under this obligation as a result wrb declared a special dividend which was distributed to the coventurers in 2014 of the 1232 million that we received 760 million was considered a return on our investment in wrb an operating cash inflow and 472 million was considered a return of our investment in wrb an investing cash inflow the returnofinvestment portion of the dividend was included in the “proceeds from asset dispositions” line in our consolidated statement of cash flows a further 129 million of distributions from wrb during 2014 was considered a return of investment 

asset sales 

proceeds from asset sales in 2014  were  1244 million  compared with  1214 million  in 2013  and  286 million  in 2012 the 2014 proceeds included a portion of the wrb special dividend as discussed above as well as the sale of our interest in mrc the 2013 proceeds included the sale of a power plant in the united kingdom as well as our gasification technology the 2012 proceeds included the sale of a refinery and associated terminal and pipeline assets located in trainer pennsylvania as well as the sale of our riverhead terminal located in riverhead new york

contingencies 

a number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims have been brought against us in connection with matters that arise in the ordinary course of business we also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement storage disposal or release of certain chemical mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites we regularly assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies in the case of all known contingencies other than those related to income taxes we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable if a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount then the minimum of the range is accrued we do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or thirdparty recoveries if applicable we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other thirdparty recoveries in the case of incometaxrelated contingencies we use a cumulative probabilityweighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain 

based on currently available information we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements as we learn new facts concerning contingencies we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include contingent liabilities recorded for environmental remediation tax and legal matters estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other potentially responsible parties estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes 

legal and tax matters 

our legal organization applies its knowledge experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases this process also enables us to track those cases that have been scheduled for trial andor mediation based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals or establishment of new accruals are required see note 22—income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about incometaxrelated contingencies 

environmental 

we are subject to the same numerous international federal state and local environmental laws and regulations as other companies in our industry the most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include among others the 

  

 

index to financial statements 

 these laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and in the case of discharges to water establish water quality limits they also in most cases require permits in association with new or modified operations these permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process which can be expensive and time consuming in addition there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency’s processing of the application many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant 

many states and foreign countries where we operate also have or are developing similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities while similar in some cases these regulations may impose additional or more stringent requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders 

the ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards such as air emission standards water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations continue to evolve however environmental laws and regulations including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the united states and in other countries in which we operate notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the united states 

an example in the fuels area is the energy policy act of 2005 which imposed obligations to provide increasing volumes of renewable fuels in transportation motor fuels through 2012 these obligations were changed with the enactment of the energy independence and security act of 2007 eisa eisa requires fuel producers and importers to provide additional renewable fuels for transportation motor fuels and stipulates a mix of various types to be included through 2022 we have met the increasingly stringent requirements to date while establishing implementation operating and capital strategies along with advanced technology development to address projected future requirements it is uncertain how various future requirements contained in eisa and the regulations promulgated thereunder may be implemented and what their full impact may be on our operations also we may experience a decrease in demand for refined petroleum products due to the regulatory program as currently promulgated for the 2014 compliance year the us environmental protection agency epa proposed to reduce the statutory volumes of advanced and total renewable fuel using authority granted to it under eisa we do not know whether this reduction will be finalized as proposed or whether the epa will utilize its authority to reduce statutory volumes in future compliance years 

we also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations such laws and regulations include cercla and rcra and their state equivalents remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility arising from petroleum releases from underground storage tanks located at numerous past and present owned andor operated petroleummarketing outlets throughout the united states federal and state laws require contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards in addition to other cleanup standards many states have adopted cleanup criteria for methyl tertiarybutyl ether mtbe for both soil and groundwater 

at rcrapermitted facilities we are required to assess environmental conditions if conditions warrant we may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations in contrast to cercla which is often referred to as “superfund” the cost of corrective action activities under rcra corrective action programs typically is borne solely by us we anticipate increased expenditures for rcra remediation activities may be required but such annual expenditures for the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures we have experienced over the past few years longerterm expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly

we occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the epa and state environmental agencies alleging we are a potentially responsible party under cercla or an equivalent state statute on occasion we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties these requests notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations as of december 31 2013  we reported we had been notified of potential liability under cercla and comparable state laws at 35 sites around the united states during 2014 there were no new sites for which we received notification of potential liability and one site was deemed resolved and closed leaving 34 unresolved sites with potential liability at december 31 2014  

for most superfund sites our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties is relatively low although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations and where they have not or where potentially responsible parties could not be located our share of liability has not increased materially many of the sites for which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the epa or the state agencies concerned prior to actual cleanup those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation in some instances we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain epa or equivalent state agency approval of a remediation plan there are relatively few sites where we are a major participant and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all cercla sites in the aggregate is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition 

expensed environmental costs were 630 million in 2014  and are expected to be approximately 680 million in each of 2015  and 2016  capitalized environmental costs were 411 million in 2014  and are expected to be approximately 320 million in each of 2015  and 2016  this amount does not include capital expenditures made for another purpose that have an indirect benefit on environmental compliance 

accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted except those assumed in a purchase business combination which we record on a discounted basis 

many of these liabilities result from cercla rcra and similar state laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct or once conducted operations or at sites where our generated waste was disposed we also have accrued for a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation but which are not currently the subject of cercla rcra or state enforcement activities if applicable we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other thirdparty recoveries in the future we may incur significant costs under both cercla and rcra remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site depending on the mix of unique site characteristics evolving remediation technologies diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties therefore it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs 

at december 31 2014  our balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of 496 million  compared with 492 million  at december 31 2013  and 530 million  at december 31 2012  we expect to incur a substantial amount of these expenditures within the next 30 years 

notwithstanding any of the foregoing and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in our operations and products and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred however we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations 

the epa’s renewable fuel standard rfs program was implemented in accordance with the energy policy act of 2005 and eisa the rfs program sets annual quotas for the percentage of biofuels such as ethanol that must be blended into motor fuels consumed in the united states a renewable identification number rin represents a serial number assigned to each gallon of biofuel produced or imported into the united states as a producer of petroleumbased motor fuels we are obligated to blend biofuels into the products we produce at a rate that is at least equal to the epa’s quota and to the extent we do not we must purchase rins in the open market to satisfy our obligation under the rfs program the market for rins has been the subject of fraudulent activity and we have identified that we have unknowingly 

index to financial statements 

purchased rins in the past that were invalid due to fraudulent activity of third parties although costs to replace fraudulently marketed rins that have been determined to be invalid have not been material through december 31 2014  it is reasonably possible that some additional rins that we have previously purchased may also be determined to be invalid should that occur we could incur additional replacement charges although the cost for replacing any additional fraudulently marketed rins is not reasonably estimable at this time we could have a possible exposure of approximately 150 million before tax it could take several years for this possible exposure to reach ultimate resolution therefore we would not expect to incur the full financial impact of additional fraudulent rins replacement costs in any single interim or annual period 

climate change 

there has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state national and international laws focusing on greenhouse gas ghg reduction these proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future laws in this field continue to evolve and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation such laws if enacted could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include 

  

 

in the eu the first phase of the eu ets completed at the end of 2007 and phase ii was undertaken from 2008 through to 2012 the current phase phase iii runs from 2013 through to 2020 with the main changes being reduced allocation of free allowances and increased auctioning of new allowances phillips 66 has assets that are subject to the eu ets and the company is actively engaged in minimizing any financial impact from the eu ets 

in the united states some additional form of regulation may be forthcoming in the future at the federal or state levels with respect to ghg emissions such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes the restriction of output investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances we are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations 

compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a ghg emission trading program or ghg reduction requirements could significantly increase our costs reduce demand for fossil energy derived products impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources an example of one such program is california’s cap and trade program which was promulgated pursuant to the state’s global warming solutions act the program has been limited to certain stationary sources which include our refineries in california but beginning in january 2015 expanded to include emissions from transportation fuels distributed in california we expect inclusion of transportation fuels in california’s cap and trade program as currently promulgated will increase our cap and trade program compliance costs the ultimate impact on our financial performance either positive or negative from this and similar programs will depend on a number of factors including but not limited to

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses see note 2—accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for descriptions of our major accounting policies certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions or if different assumptions had been used the following discussion of critical accounting estimates along with the discussion of contingencies in this report address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions could be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change 

impairments 

longlived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows is expected to be generated by an asset group if upon review the sum of the undiscounted pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group including applicable liabilities the carrying value of the longlived assets included in the asset group is written down to estimated fair value individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets for example at a refinery complex level because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for longlived assets the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined using one or more of the following methods the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants a market multiple of earnings for similar assets or historical market transactions of similar assets adjusted using principal market participant assumptions when necessary the expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future volumes commodity prices operating costs margins discount rates and capital project decisions considering all available information at the date of review 

investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence of a loss in value such evidence of a loss in value might include our inability to recover the carrying amount the lack of sustained earnings capacity which would justify the current investment amount or a current fair value less than the investment’s carrying amount when it is determined such a loss in value is other than temporary an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the investment’s carrying value and its estimated fair value when determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline the investee’s financial condition and nearterm prospects and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value of the investment when quoted market prices are not available the fair value is usually based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants and a market analysis of comparable assets if appropriate differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period

asset retirement obligations 

under various contracts permits and regulations we have legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land at the end of operations at certain operational sites our largest asset removal obligations involve asbestos abatement at refineries estimating the timing and amount of payments for future asset removal costs is difficult most of these removal obligations are many years or decades in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs asset removal technologies and costs regulatory and other compliance considerations expenditure timing and other inputs into valuation of the obligation including discount and inflation rates are also subject to change 

environmental costs 

in addition to asset retirement obligations discussed above under the above or similar contracts permits and regulations we have certain obligations to complete environmentalrelated projects these projects are primarily related to cleanup at domestic refineries underground storage sites and nonoperated sites future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties 

intangible assets and goodwill 

at december 31 2014  we had 756 million  of intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives and thus they are not amortized this judgmental assessment of an indefinite useful life must be continuously evaluated in the future if due to changes in facts and circumstances management determines these intangible assets have finite useful lives amortization will commence at that time on a prospective basis as long as these intangible assets are judged to have indefinite lives they will be subject to annual impairment tests that require management’s judgment of the estimated fair value of these intangible assets 

at december 31 2014  we had 33 billion  of goodwill recorded in conjunction with past business combinations goodwill is not amortized instead goodwill is subject to at least annual reviews for impairment at a reporting unit level the reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed a reporting unit is an operating segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment 

effective january 1 2014 we reallocated 52 million of goodwill from the refining segment to the ms segment based upon the realignment of certain assets between the reporting units goodwill was reassigned to the reporting units using a relative fair value approach goodwill impairment testing was completed and no impairment recognition was required see note 27—segment disclosures and related information  for additional information on this segment realignment sales or dispositions of significant assets within a reporting unit are allocated a portion of that reporting unit’s goodwill based on relative fair values which adjusts the amount of gain or loss on the sale or disposition 

because quoted market prices for our reporting units were not available management applied judgment in determining the estimated fair values of the reporting units for purposes of performing the goodwill impairment test management used all available information to make this fair value determination including observed market earnings multiples of comparable companies our common stock price and associated total company market capitalization and the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the assets 

we completed our annual impairment test as of october 1 2014 and concluded that the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their recorded net book values including goodwill our refining reporting unit had a percentage excess of fair value over recorded net book value of approximately 60 percent our transportation and ms reporting unit’s fair values exceeded their recorded net book values by over 100 percent however a decline in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units in the future could result in an impairment for example a prolonged or significant decline in our stock price or a significant decline in actual or forecasted earnings could provide evidence of a significant decline in fair value and a need to record a material impairment of goodwill for one or more of our reporting units 

index to financial statements 

tax assets and liabilities 

our operations are subject to various taxes including federal state and foreign income taxes and transactional taxes such as excise salesuse property and payroll taxes we record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations the recording of tax liabilities requires significant judgment and estimates we recognize the financial statement effects of an income tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority a contingent liability related to a transactional tax claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and estimable actual incurred tax liabilities can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons including different interpretations of tax laws and regulations and different assessments of the amount of tax due 

in determining our income tax provision we assess the likelihood our deferred tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income valuation allowances reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized judgment is required in estimating the amount of valuation allowance if any that should be recorded against our deferred tax assets based on our historical taxable income our expectations for the future and available taxplanning strategies we expect the net deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as reductions to future taxable income if our actual results of operations differ from such estimates or our estimates of future taxable income change the valuation allowance may need to be revised 

new tax laws and regulations as well as changes to existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being proposed or promulgated the implementation of future legislative and regulatory tax initiatives could result in increased tax liabilities that cannot be predicted at this time 

projected benefit obligations 

determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement the actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events including estimated retirement dates salary levels at retirement mortality rates lumpsum election rates rates of return on plan assets future health care costtrend rates and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees due to the specialized nature of these calculations we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects ultimately we will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions a 1 percent decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by an estimated 80 million while a 1 percent decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by an estimated 30 million in determining the discount rate we use yields on highquality fixed income investments with payments matched to the estimated distributions of benefits from our plans 

in 2014 and 2013 the company used an expected longterm rate of return of 7 percent for the us pension plan assets which account for 75 percent of the company’s pension plan assets the actual asset returns for 2014 and 2013 were 9 percent and 16 percent respectively for the eight years prior to the separation actual asset returns averaged 7 percent for the us pension plan assets the 2013 asset returns of 16 percent were associated with a broad recovery in the financial markets during the year 

new accounting standards 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update asu no 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers topic 606” the new standard converged guidance on recognizing revenues in contracts with customers under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and international financial reporting standards this asu is intended to improve comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities industries jurisdictions and capital markets asu 201409 is effective for annual and quarterly reporting periods of public entities beginning after december 15 2016 early application for public entities is not permitted we are currently evaluating the provisions of asu 201409 and assessing the impact if any it may have on our financial position and results of operations

financial instrument market risk 

we and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose our cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates we may use financial and commoditybased derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of crude oil and related products natural gas ngl and electric power fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates or to capture market opportunities 

our use of derivative instruments is governed by an “authority limitations” document approved by our board of directors that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient market liquidity for comparable valuations the authority limitations document also establishes the value at risk var limits for us and compliance with these limits is monitored daily our chief financial officer monitors risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates our president monitors commodity price risk the commercial organization manages our commercial marketing optimizes our commodity flows and positions and monitors related risks of our businesses 

commodity price risk 

we sell into or receive supply from the worldwide crude oil refined products natural gas ngl and electric power markets and are exposed to fluctuations in the prices for these commodities 

these fluctuations can affect our revenues and purchases as well as the cost of operating investing and financing activities generally our policy is to remain exposed to the market prices of commodities 

our commercial organization uses futures forwards swaps and options in various markets to optimize the value of our supply chain which may move our risk profile away from market average prices to accomplish the following objectives 

  

 

we use a var model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments held or issued including commodity purchase and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at december 31 2014  as derivative instruments using monte carlo simulation a 95 percent confidence level and a oneday holding period the var for those instruments issued or held for trading purposes at december 31 2014  and 2013  was immaterial to our cash flows and net income 

the var for instruments held for purposes other than trading at december 31 2014  and 2013  was also immaterial to our cash flows and net income

corporate structure 

phillips 66 headquartered in houston texas was incorporated in delaware on november 10 2011 in connection with and in anticipation of a restructuring of conocophillips on april 4 2012 the conocophillips board of directors approved the separation of its downstream businesses into an independent publicly traded company named phillips 66 in accordance with the separation and distribution agreement between conocophillips and phillips 66 the two companies were separated by conocophillips distributing to its stockholders all 625272302 shares of common stock of phillips 66 after the market closed on april 30 2012 the separation each conocophillips stockholder received one share of phillips 66 stock for every two shares of conocophillips stock held at the close of business on the record date of april 16 2012 on may 1 2012 phillips 66 stock began trading “regularway” on the new york stock exchange under the “psx” stock symbol 

effective january 1 2013 we changed the organizational structure of the internal financial information reviewed by our chief executive officer and determined this resulted in a change in the composition of our operating segments the primary effects of this reporting reorganization were 

 

 

this realignment resulted in the following operating segments

marine vessels 

at december 31 2013  we had 14 doublehulled internationalflagged crude oil and product tankers under term charter with capacities ranging in size from 300000 to 1100000 barrels additionally we had under term charter two jones act compliant tankers and 53 barges these vessels are used primarily to transport feedstocks or provide product transportation for certain of our refineries including delivery of domestic crude oil to our gulf coast and east coast refineries 

  

truck and rail 

truck and rail operations support our us refinery and specialty operations rail movements are provided via a diverse fleet of more than 10000 owned and leased railcars in october 2012 we entered into an operating lease covering 2000 newly constructed railcars the railcars were delivered in batches throughout 2013 this is an expansion of our existing rail business and allows for increased delivery of advantaged crude to our refineries on the east and west coasts truck movements are provided through approximately 150 thirdparty truck companies as well as through sentinel transportation llc in which we hold an equity interest 

dcp midstream 

our midstream segment includes our 50 percent equity investment in dcp midstream which is headquartered in denver colorado as of december 31 2013  dcp midstream owned or operated 64 natural gas processing facilities with a net processing capacity of approximately 75 bcfd dcp midstreams owned or operated natural gas pipeline systems included gathering services for these facilities as well as natural gas transmission and totaled approximately 67000 miles of pipeline dcp midstream also owned or operated 12 ngl fractionation plants along with natural gas and ngl storage facilities a propane wholesale marketing business and ngl pipeline assets 

in 2013  dcp midstream gathered processed andor transported an average of 71 trillion  british thermal units tbtu per day of natural gas and produced approximately 426000  barrels per day of ngl compared with 71  tbtu per day and 402000  barrels per day in 2012  

the residual natural gas primarily methane which results from processing raw natural gas is sold by dcp midstream at marketbased prices to marketers and end users including large industrial companies natural gas distribution companies and electric utilities dcp midstream purchases or takes custody of substantially all of its raw natural gas from producers principally under the following types of contractual arrangements 

  

 

index to financial statements 

sale of the residue natural gas and ngl or an agreedupon percentage of the proceeds based on indexrelated prices for natural gas and ngl regardless of the actual amount of sales proceeds which dcp midstream receives certain of these arrangements may also result in the producer retaining title to all or a portion of the residue natural gas andor the ngl in lieu of dcp midstream returning sales proceeds to the producer additionally these arrangements may include feebased components dcp midstreams revenues from percentageofproceedsindex arrangements relate directly to the price of natural gas ngl and condensate dcp midstreams revenues under percentofliquids arrangements relate directly to the price of ngl and condensate more than 70 percent of the natural gas volumes gathered and processed are under percentageofproceeds contracts 

  

 

 dcp midstream markets a portion of its ngl to us and cpchem under an existing 15year supply agreement which ends in december 2014 the contract provides for a ratable winddown period which expires in january 2019 if it is not renegotiated or renewed this purchase commitment is on an “ifproduced willpurchase” basis and is expected to have a relatively stable purchase pattern over the remaining term of the contract under the agreement ngl is purchased at various published marketindex prices less transportation and fractionation fees 

during the first quarter of 2013 dcp midstream partners lp dcp partners dcp midstreams sponsored master limited partnership announced that construction of its 200 million cubicfeetperday eagle plant was complete and the plant was inservice on february 3 2014 dcp midstream and dcp partners announced that the 200 million cubicfeetperday goliad plant was in startup the dcp midstream enterprises total natural gas processing capacity in the eagle ford area increased to 12 billion cubic feet per day upon completion of the goliad plant 

in june 2013 we along with dcp midstream and spectra energy announced that the sand hills and southern hills ngl pipelines were inservice the sand hills and southern hills pipelines began taking linefill in the fourth quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013 respectively the sand hills pipeline provides takeaway service from plants in the permian and eagle ford basins to fractionation facilities along the texas gulf coast and the mont belvieu texas market hub the sand hills pipeline consists of approximately 720 miles of pipeline and is expected to ramp up to a capacity of more than 200000 barrels per day after completion of initial pump stations in 2014 with further capacity increases to 350000 barrels per day possible with the installation of planned pump stations the southern hills pipeline provides takeaway service from dcp midstream and thirdparty plants in the midcontinent to fractionation facilities along the texas gulf coast and the mont belvieu market hub the southern hills pipeline consists of approximately 800 miles of pipeline and is expected to ramp up to a capacity of 175000 barrels per day after completion of planned pump stations in 2014 phillips 66 spectra energy and dcp midstream each have a onethird direct interest in each of the dcp southern hills and dcp sand hills pipeline entities

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form 10k each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock 

our operating results and future rate of growth are exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices and refining petrochemical and plastics margins 

our revenues operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent on a number of factors including fixed and variable expenses including the cost of crude oil ngls and other refinery and petrochemicals feedstocks and the margin relative to those expenses at which we are able to sell refined and chemicals segment products in recent years the prices of feedstocks and our products have fluctuated substantially these prices depend on numerous factors beyond our control including the global supply and demand for feedstocks and our products which are subject to among other things 

  

 

the price of crude oil influences prices for refined products we do not produce crude oil and must purchase all of the crude oil we process many crude oils available on the world market will not meet the quality restrictions for use in our refineries others are not economical to use due to excessive transportation costs or for other reasons the prices for crude oil and refined products can fluctuate differently based on global regional and local market conditions in addition the timing of the relative movement of the prices both among different classes of refined products and among various global markets for similar refined products as well as the overall change in refined product prices can reduce refining margins and could have a significant impact on our refining wholesale marketing and retail operations revenues operating income and cash flows also crude oil supply contracts generally have marketresponsive pricing provisions we normally purchase our refinery feedstocks weeks before manufacturing and selling the refined products price level changes during the period between purchasing feedstocks and selling the refined products from these feedstocks could have a significant effect on our financial results we also purchase refined products produced by others for sale to our customers price level changes during the periods between purchasing and selling these refined products also could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the price of feedstocks also influences prices for petrochemical and plastics products although our chemicals segment gathers transports and fractionates feedstocks to meet a portion of their demand and has certain longterm feedstock supply contracts with others it is still subject to volatile feedstock prices in addition the petrochemicals industry is both cyclical and volatile cyclicality occurs when periods of tight supply resulting in increased prices and profit margins are followed by periods of capacity expansion resulting in oversupply and declining prices and profit margins volatility occurs as a result of changes in supply and demand for products changes in energy prices and changes in various other economic conditions around the world 

uncertainty and illiquidity in credit and capital markets can impair our ability to obtain credit and financing on acceptable terms and can adversely affect the financial strength of our business partners 

our ability to obtain credit and capital depends in large measure on the state of the credit and capital markets which is beyond our control our ability to access credit and capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like or need access to those markets which could constrain our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions in addition the cost and availability of debt and equity financing may be adversely impacted by unstable or illiquid market conditions protracted uncertainty and illiquidity in these markets also could have an adverse impact on our lenders commodity hedging counterparties or our customers preventing them from meeting their obligations to us 

index to financial statements 

from time to time our cash needs may exceed our internally generated cash flow and our business could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to obtain necessary funds from financing activities from time to time we may need to supplement our cash generated from operations with proceeds from financing activities uncertainty and illiquidity in financial markets may materially impact the ability of the participating financial institutions to fund their commitments to us under our liquidity facilities accordingly we may not be able to obtain the full amount of the funds available under our liquidity facilities to satisfy our cash requirements and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position 

deterioration in our credit profile could increase our costs of borrowing money and limit our access to the capital markets and commercial credit and could trigger coventurer rights under joint venture arrangements 

our credit ratings could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment the circumstances warrant if a rating agency were to downgrade our rating below investment grade our borrowing costs would increase and our funding sources could decrease in addition a failure by us to maintain an investment grade rating could affect our business relationships with suppliers and operating partners for example our agreement with chevron regarding cpchem permits chevron to buy our 50 percent interest in cpchem for fair market value if we experience a change in control or if both sp and moodys lower our credit ratings below investment grade and the credit rating from either rating agency remains below investment grade for 365 days thereafter with fair market value determined by agreement or by nationally recognized investment banks as a result of these factors a downgrade of our credit ratings could have a materially adverse impact on our future operations and financial position 

we expect to continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of our compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations likewise future environmental laws and regulations may impact or limit our current business plans and reduce demand for our products 

our business is subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment these laws and regulations continue to increase in both number and complexity and affect our operations with respect to among other things 

  

 

we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital operating and maintenance and remediation expenditures as a result of these laws and regulations to the extent these expenditures as with all costs are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in future periods could be materially adversely affected 

the us environmental protection agency epa has implemented a renewable fuel standard rfs pursuant to the energy policy act of 2005 and the energy independence and security act of 2007 the rfs program sets annual quotas for the quantity of renewable fuels such as ethanol that must be blended into motor fuels consumed in the united states to provide certain flexibility in compliance options available to the industry a renewable identification number rin is assigned to each gallon of renewable fuel produced in or imported into the united states as a producer of petroleumbased motor fuels we are obligated to blend renewable fuels into the products we produce at a rate that is at least commensurate to the epas quota and to the extent we do not we must purchase rins in the open market to satisfy our obligation under the rfs program to the extent the epa mandates a quantity of renewable fuel that exceeds the amount that is commercially feasible to blend into motor fuel a situation commonly referred to as the blend wall our operations could be materially adversely impacted up to and including a reduction in produced motor fuel 

to the extent there are significant changes in the earths climate such as more severe or frequent weather conditions in the markets we serve or the areas where our assets reside we could incur increased expenses our operations could be materially impacted and demand for our products could fall 

index to financial statements 

domestic and worldwide political and economic developments could damage our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows 

actions of the us state local and international governments through tax and other legislation executive order and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability both in the united states and abroad the us government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries these restrictions and those of foreign governments could limit our ability to operate in or gain access to opportunities in various countries as well as limit our ability to obtain the optimum slate of crude oil and other refinery feedstocks our foreign operations and those of our joint ventures are further subject to risks of loss of revenue equipment and property as a result of expropriation acts of terrorism war civil unrest and other political risks unilateral or forced renegotiation modification or nullification of existing contracts with governmental entities and difficulties enforcing rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations actions by both the united states and host governments may affect our operations significantly in the future 

renewable fuels alternative energy mandates and energy conservation efforts could reduce demand for refined products tax incentives and other subsidies can make renewable fuels and alternative energy more competitive with refined products than they otherwise might be which may reduce refined product margins and hinder the ability of refined products to compete with renewable fuels 

large capital projects can take many years to complete and market conditions could deteriorate significantly between the project approval date and the project startup date negatively impacting project returns 

to approve a largescale capital project the project must meet an acceptable level of return on the capital to be employed in the project we base these forecasted project economics on our best estimate of future market conditions most largescale projects take many years to complete during this multiyear period market conditions can change from those we forecast and these changes could be significant accordingly we may not be able to realize our expected returns from a large investment in a capital project and this could negatively impact our results of operations cash flows and our return on capital employed 

our investments in joint ventures decrease our ability to manage risk 

we conduct some of our operations including a large part of our midstream segment and our entire chemicals segment through joint ventures in which we share control with our joint venture participants our joint venture participants may have economic business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with those of the joint venture or us or our joint venture participants may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone failure by us or an entity in which we have a jointventure interest to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisitions or joint ventures could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our joint ventures and in turn our business and operations 

activities in our chemicals and midstream segments involve numerous risks that may result in accidents or otherwise affect the ability of our equity affiliates to make distributions to us 

there are a variety of hazards and operating risks inherent in the manufacture of petrochemicals and the gathering processing transmission storage and distribution of natural gas and ngl such as spills leaks explosions and mechanical problems that could cause substantial financial losses in addition these risks could result in significant injury loss of human life damage to property environmental pollution and impairment of operations any of which could result in substantial losses for assets located near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers industrial sites and other public gathering areas the level of damage resulting from these risks could be greater should any of these risks materialize it could have a material adverse effect on the business and financial condition of cpchem dcp midstream or rex and negatively impact their ability to make future distributions to us 

index to financial statements 

our operations present hazards and risks which may not be fully covered by insurance if insured if a significant accident or event occurs for which we are not adequately insured our operations and financial results could be adversely affected 

the scope and nature of our operations present a variety of operational hazards and risks including explosions fires toxic emissions maritime hazards and natural catastrophes that must be managed through continual oversight and control for example the operation of refineries power plants fractionators pipelines terminals and vessels is inherently subject to the risks of spills discharges or other inadvertent releases of petroleum or hazardous substances if any of these events had previously occurred or occurs in the future in connection with any of our refineries pipelines or refined products terminals or in connection with any facilities that receive our wastes or byproducts for treatment or disposal other than events for which we are indemnified we could be liable for all costs and penalties associated with their remediation under federal state local and international environmental laws or common law and could be liable for property damage to third parties caused by contamination from releases and spills these and other risks are present throughout our operations as protection against these hazards and risks we maintain insurance against many but not all potential losses or liabilities arising from such operating risks as such our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover us against potential losses arising from such risks uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating risks could reduce the funds available to us for capital and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to interruptions of supply and increased costs as a result of our reliance on thirdparty transportation of crude oil and refined products 

we often utilize the services of third parties to transport crude oil ngl and refined products to and from our facilities in addition to our own operational risks discussed above we could experience interruptions of supply or increases in costs to deliver refined products to market if the ability of the pipelines or vessels to transport crude oil or refined products is disrupted because of weather events accidents governmental regulations or thirdparty actions a prolonged disruption of the ability of a pipeline or vessel to transport crude oil or refined product to or from one or more of our refineries could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in us production of crude oil and natural gas which could adversely impact our results of operations 

an increasing percentage of crude oil supplied to our refineries and the crude oil and gas production of dcp midstreams customers is being developed from unconventional sources such as deep oil and gas shales these reservoirs require hydraulic fracturing completion processes to release the hydrocarbons from the rock so it can flow through casing to the surface hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water sand and chemicals under pressure into the formation to stimulate hydrocarbon production the us environmental protection agency as well as several state agencies have commenced studies andor convened hearings regarding the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities at the same time certain environmental groups have suggested that additional laws may be needed to more closely and uniformly regulate the hydraulic fracturing process and legislation has been proposed to provide for such regulation we cannot predict whether any such legislation will ever be enacted and if so what its provisions would be any additional levels of regulation and permits required with the adoption of new laws and regulations at the federal or state level could result in our having to rely on higher priced crude oil for our refineries and lead to delays increased operating costs and process prohibitions that could reduce the volumes of natural gas that move through dcp midstreams gathering systems and could reduce supplies and increase costs of ngl feedstocks to cpchem ethylene facilities this could materially adversely affect our results of operations and the ability of dcp midstream and cpchem to make cash distributions to us 

because of the natural decline in production from existing wells in dcp midstreams areas of operation its success depends on its ability to obtain new sources of natural gas and ngl any decrease in the volumes of natural gas dcp midstream gathers could adversely affect its business and operating results 

dcp midstreams gathering and transportation pipeline systems are connected to or dependent on the level of production from natural gas wells from which production will naturally decline over time as a result its cash flows associated with these wells will also decline over time in order to maintain or increase throughput levels on its gathering and transportation pipeline systems and ngl pipelines and the asset utilization rates at its natural gas processing plants dcp 

index to financial statements 

midstream must continually obtain new supplies the primary factors affecting dcp midstreams ability to obtain new supplies of natural gas and ngl and to attract new customers to its assets include the level of successful drilling activity near these assets the demand for natural gas and crude oil producers desire and ability to obtain necessary permits in an efficient manner natural gas field characteristics and production performance surface access and infrastructure issues and its ability to compete for volumes from successful new wells if dcp midstream is not able to obtain new supplies of natural gas to replace the natural decline in volumes from existing wells or because of competition throughput on its pipelines and the utilization rates of its treating and processing facilities would decline this could have a material adverse effect on its business results of operations financial position and cash flows and its ability to make cash distributions to us 

competitors that produce their own supply of feedstocks have more extensive retail outlets or have greater financial resources may have a competitive advantage 

the refining and marketing industry is highly competitive with respect to both feedstock supply and refined product markets we compete with many companies for available supplies of crude oil and other feedstocks and for outlets for our refined products we do not produce any of our crude oil feedstocks some of our competitors however obtain a portion of their feedstocks from their own production and some have more extensive retail outlets than we have competitors that have their own production or extensive retail outlets and greater brandname recognition are at times able to offset losses from refining operations with profits from producing or retailing operations and may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages 

some of our competitors also have materially greater financial and other resources than we have such competitors have a greater ability to bear the economic risks inherent in all phases of our business in addition we compete with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel requirements of our industrial commercial and individual customers 

we may incur losses as a result of our forwardcontract activities and derivative transactions 

we currently use commodity derivative instruments and we expect to continue their use in the future if the instruments we utilize to hedge our exposure to various types of risk are not effective we may incur losses derivative transactions involve the risk that counterparties may be unable to satisfy their obligations to us if any of our counterparties were to default on its obligations to us under the hedging contracts or seek bankruptcy protection it could have an adverse effect on our ability to fund our planned activities and could result in a larger percentage of our future production being subject to commodity price changes the risk of counterparty default is heightened in a poor economic environment 

one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of a publicly traded master limited partnership phillips 66 partners lp which may involve a greater exposure to legal liability than our historic business operations 

one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of phillips 66 partners lp a publicly traded master limited partnership our control of the general partner of phillips 66 partners may increase the possibility that we could be subject to claims of breach of fiduciary duties including claims of conflicts of interest related to phillips 66 partners any liability resulting from such claims could have a material adverse effect on our future business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a significant interruption in one or more of our facilities could adversely affect our business 

our operations could be subject to significant interruption if one or more of our facilities were to experience a major accident or mechanical failure power outage encounter work stoppages relating to organized labor issues be damaged by severe weather or other natural or manmade disaster such as an act of terrorism or otherwise be forced to shut down if any facility were to experience an interruption in operations earnings from the facility could be materially adversely affected to the extent not recoverable through insurance if insured because of lost production and repair costs a significant interruption in one or more of our facilities could also lead to increased volatility in prices for feedstocks and refined products and could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets making it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain insurance coverage that we consider adequate 

index to financial statements 

our performance depends on the uninterrupted operation of our facilities which are becoming increasingly dependent on our information technology systems 

our performance depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of the manufacturing equipment in our production facilities the inability to operate one or more of our facilities due to a natural disaster power outage labor dispute or failure of one or more of our information technology telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to manufacture our products our manufacturing equipment is becoming increasingly dependent on our information technology systems a disruption in our information technology systems due to a catastrophic event or security breach could interrupt or damage our operations 

security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability which would cause our business and reputation to suffer 

in the ordinary course of our business we collect sensitive data including personally identifiable information of our customers using credit cards at our branded retail outlets despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions although we have experienced occasional actual or attempted breaches of our cybersecurity none of these breaches has had a material effect on our business operations or reputation or compromised any customer data any such breaches could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability under laws that protect the privacy of customer information disrupt the services we provide to customers and damage our reputation any of which could adversely affect our business 

the level of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the expected return on plan assets for our pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans are evaluated by us in consultation with outside actuaries if we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected longterm rate of return or health care cost trend rate our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses and funding requirements could increase in addition several factors could result in actual results differing significantly from the actuarial assumptions that we use funding obligations are determined based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date as required under relevant regulations future pension funding requirements and the timing of funding payments could be affected by legislation enacted by governmental authorities 

in connection with the separation conocophillips has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities and we have agreed to indemnify conocophillips for certain liabilities if we are required to act on these indemnities to conocophillips we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations and our financial results could be negatively impacted the conocophillips indemnity may not be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of liabilities for which it has been allocated responsibility and conocophillips may not be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future 

pursuant to the indemnification and release agreement and certain other agreements with conocophillips entered into in connection with the separation conocophillips agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities and we agreed to indemnify conocophillips for certain liabilities indemnities that we may be required to provide conocophillips are not subject to any cap may be significant and could negatively impact our business particularly indemnities relating to our actions that could impact the taxfree nature of the distribution of phillips 66 stock third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that conocophillips has agreed to retain further the indemnity from conocophillips may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities and conocophillips may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations moreover even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from conocophillips any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves each of these risks could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

index to financial statements 

we are subject to continuing contingent liabilities of conocophillips following the separation 

notwithstanding the separation there are several significant areas where the liabilities of conocophillips may become our obligations for example under the internal revenue code and the related rules and regulations each corporation that was a member of the conocophillips consolidated us federal income tax reporting group during any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the effective time of the separation is jointly and severally liable for the us federal income tax liability of the entire conocophillips consolidated tax reporting group for that taxable period in connection with the separation we entered into the tax sharing agreement with conocophillips that allocates the responsibility for prior period taxes of the conocophillips consolidated tax reporting group between us and conocophillips conocophillips may be unable to pay any prior period taxes for which it is responsible and we could be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes other provisions of federal law establish similar liability for other matters including laws governing taxqualified pension plans as well as other contingent liabilities 

if the distribution in connection with the separation together with certain related transactions does not qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes our stockholders and conocophillips could be subject to significant tax liability and in certain circumstances we could be required to indemnify conocophillips for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax sharing agreement 

conocophillips received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service irs substantially to the effect that among other things the distribution together with certain related transactions qualified as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code the private letter ruling and the tax opinion that conocophillips received relied on certain representations assumptions and undertakings including those relating to the past and future conduct of our business and neither the private letter ruling nor the opinion would be valid if such representations assumptions and undertakings were incorrect moreover the private letter ruling does not address all the issues that are relevant to determining whether the distribution qualified for taxfree treatment notwithstanding the private letter ruling and the tax opinion the irs could determine the distribution should be treated as a taxable transaction for us federal income tax purposes if it determines any of the representations assumptions or undertakings that were included in the request for the private letter ruling are false or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion that are not covered by the irs ruling 

if the irs were to determine that the distribution failed to qualify for taxfree treatment in general conocophillips would be subject to tax as if it had sold the phillips 66 common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value and conocophillips stockholders who received shares of phillips 66 common stock in the distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares 

under the tax sharing agreement we would generally be required to indemnify conocophillips against any tax resulting from the distribution to the extent that such tax resulted from i an acquisition of all or a portion of our stock or assets whether by merger or otherwise ii other actions or failures to act by us or iii any of our representations or undertakings being incorrect or violated our indemnification obligations to conocophillips and its subsidiaries officers and directors are not limited by any maximum amount if we are required to indemnify conocophillips or such other persons under the circumstances set forth in the tax sharing agreement we may be subject to substantial liabilities 

we may not be able to engage in desirable strategic or capitalraising transactions due to limitations imposed on us as part of the separation in addition under some circumstances we could be liable for adverse tax consequences resulting from engaging in significant strategic or capitalraising transactions 

to preserve the taxfree treatment to conocophillips of the distribution for the twoyear period following the distribution we may be prohibited except in specified circumstances from

we continue to focus on the following strategic priorities 

 

 

 

 

index to financial statements 

business environment 

the midstream segment includes our 50 percent equity investment in dcp midstream earnings of dcp midstream are closely linked to ngl prices natural gas prices and to a lesser extent crude oil prices industry ngl annual average prices decreased from 2011 to 2012 and again from 2012 to 2013 due to relatively higher inventories driven by growing ngl production from liquidsrich shale plays with limited corresponding demand increase from the petrochemical industry and constrained export capacity natural gas prices decreased from 2011 to 2012 but increased from 2012 to 2013 the decrease in natural gas prices in 2012 was largely due to higher supply levels and relatively lower demand the increase in 2013 was primarily driven by relatively colder weather in the first half of the year which lowered inventory stock levels to below the fiveyear average low as well as pipeline constraints in the northeast united states 

the chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in cpchem the chemicals and plastics industry is mainly a commoditybased industry where the margins for key products are based on market factors the chemicals and plastics industry continues to experience higher ethylene margins in regions of the world where production is based upon ngl versus crudederived feedstocks in particular north american ethanebased crackers benefited from the lowerpriced feedstocks and improved ethylene margins this margin strength was sustained through the ethylene chain including polyethylene 

results for our refining segment depend largely on refining margins cost control refinery throughput and product yields the crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined petroleum products and crude oil and it is used within our industry as an indicator for refining margins the us 321 crack spread three barrels of crude oil producing two barrels of gasoline and one barrel of diesel increased from 2011 to 2012 but decreased from 2012 to 2013 the 2012 domestic industry average crack spread improved over 2011 primarily as a result of improved global demand for refined products resulting from worldwide economic recovery along with limited net increase in global refining capacity us margins in the midcontinent were especially strong which was attributed to the regions crude feedstock advantage during this period the decrease in the domestic industry average crack spread from 2012 to 2013 was largely due to the larger decline in gasoline and distillates prices compared to crude prices during 2013 as a result of expansion in refining capacity 

us crude production continues to increase and nationwide growth is benefiting from slower decline rates in legacy production areas limited infrastructure for takeaway options resulted in favorable feedstock prices for us refiners with access to advantaged crudes midcontinent refiners were especially advantaged sustained pressure on inventories in the midcontinent caused west texas intermediate wti crude to continue trading at a discount relative to crudes such as light louisiana sweet lls and brent during 2013 refineries capable of processing wti crude and crude oils that price relative to wti primarily the midcontinent and gulf coast refineries benefited from these lower regional feedstock prices the spread between wti and brent over the year narrowed considerably stemming from increased pipeline outlets from cushing to the gulf coast as well as tightening canadian light crude supply in the midcontinent region 

the northwest europe benchmark crack spread increased from 2011 to 2012 but decreased from 2012 to 2013 the improved benchmark crack spread in northwest europe for 2012 compared with 2011 resulted from improved global demand for refined products with worldwide economic recovery the decline from 2012 to 2013 was due to lower european domestic and export product demand on weak refinery economics while large volumes of imported diesel from the united states india asia pacific and russia kept prices under pressure weak domestic european demand and reduced export markets for gasoline compounded the declining product crack spreads 

results for our ms segment depend largely on marketing fuel margins lubricant margins and other specialty product margins these margins are primarily based on market factors largely determined by the relationship between demand and supply marketing fuel margins are primarily determined by the trend of the spot prices for refined products generally a downward trend of spot prices has a favorable impact on the marketing fuel margins while an upward trend of spot prices has an unfavorable impact on marketing fuel margins

see note 20—income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding our provision for income taxes  and effective tax rates 

2012  vs 2011   

sales and other operating revenues  decreased 8 percent in 2012 while purchased crude oil and products  decreased 11 percent the decreases were mainly due to processing lower refining volumes at our wholly owned refineries resulting from the shutdown of trainer refinery in september 2011 combined with lower crude oil and ngl prices 

equity in earnings of affiliates  increased 10 percent in 2012 primarily resulting from improved earnings from wrb and cpchem equity in earnings of wrb increased 43 percent mainly due to higher refining margins in the central corridor combined with processing higher volumes associated with the coker and refining expansion core project at the wood river refinery equity in earnings of cpchem increased 22 percent primarily resulting from higher ethylene and polyethylene margins 

these improvements were partially offset by 

 

net gain on dispositions  decreased 88 percent in 2012 primarily resulting from 2011 gains associated with the disposition of three pipeline systems compared with a net gain associated with the sale of trainer refinery and

segment results 

midstream 

  



 based on index prices from the mont belvieu and conway market hubs that are weighted by ngl component and location mix 



pipelines represent the sum of volumes transported through each separately tariffed pipeline segment including our share of equity volumes from yellowstone pipe line company and lake charles pipe line company 

 includes our share of equity affiliates 

excludes dcp midstream 

the midstream segment purchases raw natural gas from producers and gathers natural gas through an extensive network of pipeline gathering systems the natural gas is then processed to extract ngl from the raw gas stream the remaining residue gas is marketed to electric utilities industrial users and gas marketing companies most of the ngls are fractionated—separated into individual components such as ethane propane and butane—and marketed as chemical feedstock fuel or blendstock in addition the midstream segment includes us transportation and terminaling services associated with the movement of crude oil refined and specialty products natural gas and ngl the midstream segment includes our 50 percent equity investment in dcp midstream as well as ngl fractionation trading and marketing businesses in the united states 

2013  vs 2012   

earnings from the midstream segment increased   416 million  in 2013  compared with 2012  the improvement was primarily driven by higher earnings from our transportation business and dcp midstream partially offset by lower earnings from ngl operations and other 

transportation earnings increased 410 million in 2013 compared with 2012 these increases primarily resulted from lower impairments in 2013 as well as increased throughput fees in 2012 we recorded aftertax impairments totaling 303 million on our equity investment in rex primarily reflecting a diminished view of fair value of westtoeast natural gas transmission due to the impact of shale gas production in the northeast for additional information on the rex impairment see note 9—impairments  in the notes to consolidated financial statements throughput fees were 

index to financial statements 

higher in 2013 primarily due to the implementation of marketbased intersegment transfer prices for transportation and terminaling services during 2013 

the 31 million increase in earnings of dcp midstream in 2013 primarily resulted from an increase in gains associated with unit issuances by dcp midstream partners lp dcp partners as described below in addition higher natural gas and crude oil prices benefitted earnings these increases were partially offset by lower ngl prices and higher interest expense see the “business environment and executive overview” section for additional information on ngl prices 

dcp partners a subsidiary of dcp midstream issues from time to time limited partner units to the public these issuances benefited our equity in earnings from dcp midstream on an aftertax basis by approximately 62 million in 2013 compared with approximately 24 million in 2012 

ngl operations and other decreased 25 million or 30 percent in 2013 compared with 2012 the decrease was primarily due to inventory impacts reflecting inventory reductions in 2012 in anticipation of the separation which caused liquidations of lifo inventory values 

2012  vs 2011   

earnings from the midstream segment decreased 2096 million in 2012 compared with 2011 the decrease was primarily due to lower net gains on disposition of assets and higher impairments in our transportation business as well as decreased equity earnings from dcp midstream these items were partially offset by a keepwhole payment received from a third party associated with the sale of its ownership in rex 

transportation earnings decreased 1989 million in 2012 compared with 2011 during 2011 transportation included an aftertax gain of 1595 million on the sales of seaway products pipeline company and our ownership interest in colonial pipeline company and seaway crude pipeline company for additional information see note 5— assets held for sale or sold  in the notes to consolidated financial statements additionally in 2012 we recorded aftertax impairments totaling 303 million on our equity investment in rex 

a 108 million decrease in earnings of dcp midstream in 2012 mainly resulted from lower ngl prices and to a lesser extent lower natural gas prices partially offset by lower depreciation favorable volume impacts due to greater ngl extracted from liquid rich areas such as permian basin eagle ford shale and denverjulesburg basin and increased gains from the issuance of limited partner units by dcp partners issuances of limited partner units by dcp partners benefited our equity earnings from dcp midstream by approximately 24 million after tax in 2012 compared with approximately 11 million after tax in 2011 

during the second quarter of 2012 dcp midstream completed a review of the estimated depreciable lives of its major classes of properties plants and equipment as a result of that review the depreciable lives were extended this change in accounting estimate was implemented on a prospective basis effective april 1 2012

chemicals 

  



the chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in cpchem which we account for under the equity method cpchem uses ngl and other feedstocks to produce petrochemicals these products are then marketed and sold or used as feedstocks to produce plastics and other chemicals 

2013  vs 2012   

cpchem continued to benefit from priceadvantaged ngl feedstocks in 2013 due to the location of its manufacturing facilities in the us gulf coast and middle east earnings from the chemicals segment increased   163 million  or 20 percent  in 2013  compared with 2012  the increase in earnings was primarily driven by 

 

these increases were partially offset by lower olefins and polyolefins sales volumes related to ethylene outages in addition increased turnaround and maintenance activity resulted in lower volumes and higher costs see the business environment and executive overview section for information on market factors impacting cpchems results 

2012  vs 2011 

earnings from the chemicals segment increased 107 million or 15 percent in 2012 compared with 2011 the increase was primarily driven by higher ethylene and polyethylene margins and lower utility costs partially offset by a loss on early extinguishment of debt and asset impairments ethylene margins benefited from lower feedstock costs particularly lower ethane and propane prices during 2012 utility costs benefited from lower natural gas prices during 2012 

during 2012 cpchem retired 1 billion of fixedrate debt cpchem also incurred prepayment premiums and wrote off the associated unamortized debt issuance costs as a result cpchem recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt in 2012 of 287 million 100 percent basis which decreased our equity in earnings from cpchem on an aftertax basis by approximately 90 million 

in addition during 2012 cpchem recorded asset impairments totaling 91 million 100 percent basis which decreased our equity in earnings from cpchem on an aftertax basis by 28 million these asset impairments primarily included certain specialties aromatics and styrenics asset groups and were mainly driven by decreases in cash flow projections

refining 

  



index to financial statements 

the refining segment buys sells and refines crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products such as gasoline distillates and aviation fuels at 15  refineries mainly in the united states europe and asia 

2013  vs 2012   

earnings for the refining segment were 1851 million  in 2013  a decrease of 1366 million  or 42 percent  compared with 2012  the decrease in earnings in 2013  was primarily due to lower realized refining margins as a result of a 16 percent reduction in market cracks and impacts related to lower feedstock advantage in addition to margins refining results were also impacted by a 104 million aftertax gain from the sale of the trainer refinery and associated terminal and pipeline assets in 2012 these decreases were partially offset by reduced impairments recorded in 2012 primarily related to mrc and wrg see the “business environment and executive overview” section for information on industry crack spreads and other market factors impacting this year’s results 

our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 93 percent  in both 2013  and 2012  as the lack of weather disruptions were offset by higher turnaround activities 

2012  vs 2011   

refining reported earnings of 3217 million in 2012 an increase of 1688 million  or 110 percent  compared with 2011 the increase in earnings in 2012 was primarily due to improved worldwide refining margins driven by improved market conditions and optimizing access to lowercost crude oil feedstocks as well as a net gain on disposition of the trainer refinery and associated terminal and pipeline assets these were partially offset by higher impairments and increased maintenance and repair expense associated with our bayway refinery as a result of severe weather disruptions 

during 2012 refining included an aftertax gain of 104 million from the sale of the trainer refinery and associated terminal and pipeline assets for additional information see note 5— assets held for sale or sold  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

additionally during 2012 refining results included an aftertax impairment of 564 million on our equity investment in mrc and an aftertax impairment of 42 million related to equipment formerly associated with the canceled wrg upgrade project compared with an aftertax impairment of 303 million on the trainer refinery during 2011 

our worldwide refining capacity utilization rate was 93 percent in 2012 compared with 92 percent in 2011 the improvement was primarily due to improved market conditions partially offset by higher turnaround and maintenance activities as well as severe weather disruptions

marketing and specialties 

  



the ms segment purchases for resale and markets refined petroleum products such as gasoline distillates and aviation fuels mainly in the united states and europe in addition this segment includes the manufacturing and marketing of specialty products such as lubricants as well as power generation operations 

2013  vs 2012   

earnings from the ms segment increased   373 million  or 89 percent  in 2013  compared with 2012  see the business environment and executive overview section for information on marketing fuel margins and other market factors impacting this years results 

during 2013 us marketing margins benefited from higher renewable identification numbers rins values associated with renewable fuels blending activities particularly during the first three quarters rin prices decreased during the fourth quarter as concerns over their availability eased somewhat based on anticipated actions by the us environmental protection agency as a result we would expect the benefit to our us marketing margins from rins to be lower in 2014 than we experienced in 2013 the increased rin prices offset weaker underlying components of our us marketing margins during 2013 

  

ms earnings benefited from higher international marketing margins in 2013 as well as an aftertax gain of 23 million from the sale of our egas tm technology business in may 2013 earnings in 2012 were lowered by income taxes associated with foreign dividends and 2012 included a full year of earnings from our uk power generation business which was sold in july 2013

2012  vs 2011 

earnings from the ms segment decreased   113 million  or 21 percent  in 2012 compared with 2011 during 2012 the segment was negatively impacted by higher income taxes associated with foreign dividends increased costs and lower volumes partially offset by higher us margins in addition 2011 earnings benefited from an aftertax gain of 26 million from the sale of our delayed coker licensing business 

corporate and other 

  



2013  vs 2012 

net interest expense consists of interest and financing expense net of interest income and capitalized interest net interest expense increased   18 million  in 2013  compared with 2012  primarily due to increased average debt outstanding in 2013 reflecting the issuance of debt in early 2012 in connection with the separation for additional information see note 12—debt  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

corporate general and administrative expenses increased   29 million  in 2013  compared with 2012  the increase was primarily due to incremental costs and expenses associated with operating as a standalone company repositioning costs decreased 55 million in 2013 compared with 2012 

2012  vs 2011 

net interest expense increased 137 million in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to approximately 78 billion of new debt issued in early 2012 for additional information see note 12—debt  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

corporate general and administrative expenses increased 40 million in 2012 compared with 2011 the increase was primarily due to incremental costs and expenses associated with operating as a standalone company for the eight months subsequent to the separation 

repositioning costs consist of expenses related to the separation expenses incurred in the eightmonth period subsequent to the separation primarily included compensation and benefits employee relocations and moves information systems and shared services costs 

the other category includes certain income tax expenses environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation foreign currency transaction gains and losses and other costs not directly associated with an operating segment changes in the other category were mainly due to an aftertax impairment of 16 million on a corporate property in 2012

capital resources and liquidity 

financial indicators 



to meet our short and longterm liquidity requirements we look to a variety of funding sources but rely primarily on cash generated from operating activities during 2013  we generated 60 billion  in cash from operations received 12 billion from asset dispositions and received 04 billion as a result of net proceeds received from the issuance of phillips 66 partners common units this available cash was primarily used for capital expenditures and investments  18 billion  repurchases of our common stock  22 billion  debt repayments  10 billion  and dividend payments on our common stock  08 billion  during 2013 cash and cash equivalents increased by 19 billion to 54 billion of which 425 million was held by phillips 66 partners 

in addition to cash flows from operating activities we rely on our credit facility programs asset sales and our shelf registration statement to support our short and longterm liquidity requirements we believe current cash and cash equivalents and cash generated by operations together with access to external sources of funds as described below under “significant sources of capital” will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near and long term including our capital spending dividend payments defined benefit plan contributions repayment of debt and share repurchases 

significant sources of capital 

operating activities 

during 2013  cash of  6027 million  was provided by operating activities a 40 percent   increase  from cash from operations of  4296 million  in 2012  the increase  in the 2013  period primarily reflected positive working capital impacts accounts payable activity increased cash from operations by 360 million in 2013  reflecting both higher volumes and commodity prices by comparison lower commodity prices and volumes reduced cash from operations by 985 million in 2012 our distributions from cpchem increased over 500 million in 2013 compared with 2012 reflecting the completion of cpchem’s debt repayments in 2012 which allowed increased dividends to us and our coventurer partially offsetting the positive impact of working capital changes in 2013  were lower refining margins during 2013  reflecting less favorable market conditions and tightening crude differentials 

during 2012  cash of  4296 million  was provided by operating activities a 14 percent   decrease  from cash from operations of  5006 million  in 2011  the decrease  primarily reflected the impact of working capital changes accounts payable activity lowered cash from operations by 985 million in 2012  primarily reflecting lower commodity prices and volumes inventory management had a reduced benefit to working capital in 2012  compared with 2011  partially offsetting the negative impact of working capital changes were improved us refining margins during 2012  reflecting improved market conditions and increasing access to lowercost crude oil feedstocks increased distributions from equity affiliates particularly wrb whose refineries are located in the central corridor region also partially offset the negative impact of working capital changes in 2012  

our short and longterm operating cash flows are highly dependent upon refining and marketing margins ngl prices and chemicals margins prices and margins in our industry are typically volatile and are driven by market conditions 

index to financial statements 

over which we have little or no control absent other mitigating factors as these prices and margins fluctuate we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows 

the level and quality of output from our refineries also impacts our cash flows the output at our refineries is impacted by such factors as operating efficiency maintenance turnarounds market conditions feedstock availability and weather conditions we actively manage the operations of our refineries and typically any variability in their operations has not been as significant to cash flows as that caused by margins and prices our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization was 93 percent  in both 2013 and 2012 we are forecasting 2014 utilization to remain in the low 90percent range 

our operating cash flows are also impacted by distribution decisions made by our equity affiliates including dcp midstream cpchem and wrb over the three years ended december 31 2013  we received distributions of 812 million  from dcp midstream 1893 million  from cpchem and  3302 million  from wrb we cannot control the amount of future distributions from equity affiliates therefore future distributions by these and other equity affiliates are not assured 

asset sales 

proceeds from asset sales in 2013  were  1214 million  compared with  286 million  in 2012  and  2627 million  in 2011 the 2013  proceeds included the sale of a power plant in the united kingdom as well as our gasification technology the 2012 proceeds included the sale of a refinery and associated terminal and pipeline assets located in trainer pennsylvania as well as the sale of our riverhead terminal located in riverhead new york the 2011 proceeds included the sale of our ownership interests in colonial pipeline company and seaway crude pipeline company as well as the wilhelmshaven refinery and seaway products pipeline company as of december 31 2013 a beforetax gain of 375 million associated with 2013 asset sales was deferred due to an indemnity provided to the buyer a portion of the deferred gain is denominated in a foreign currency accordingly the amount of the deferred gain translated into us dollars is subject to change based on currency fluctuations absent claims under the indemnity the deferred gain will be recognized into earnings as our exposure under this indemnity declines currently expected to begin in the second half of 2014 and end in the first half of 2015 

initial public offering of phillips 66 partners lp 

in 2013 we formed phillips 66 partners a master limited partnership to own operate develop and acquire primarily feebased crude oil refined petroleum product and ngl pipelines and terminals as well as other transportation and midstream assets on july 26 2013 phillips 66 partners completed its initial public offering of 18888750 common units at a price of 2300 per unit which included a 2463750 common unit overallotment option that was fully exercised by the underwriters phillips 66 partners received 404 million in net proceeds from the sale of the units after deducting underwriting discounts commissions structuring fees and offering expenses headquartered in houston texas phillips 66 partners assets consist of crude oil and refined petroleum product pipeline terminal and storage systems in the central and gulf coast regions of the united states each of which is integral to a connected phillips 66operated refinery

debt financings 

our 58 billion of senior notes were issued by phillips 66 and are guaranteed by phillips 66 company a 100percentowned subsidiary our senior unsecured longterm debt has been rated investment grade by sp and moodys we do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default and thereby impact our access to liquidity in the event of a downgrade of our credit rating if our credit rating deteriorated to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market we would expect to be able to access funds under our liquidity facilities mentioned above 

shelf registration 

we have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the sec under which we as a wellknown seasoned issuer have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities 

other financing

in midstream we plan 14 billion of investment in our ngl operations and transportation business lines this represents an increase of 09 billion over 2013 in 2014 we expect to begin construction of a 100000 barrelperday ngl fractionator and a 44 millionbarrelpermonth liquefied petroleum gas export terminal on the us gulf coast in addition several rail offloading facilities and other crude handling projects will increase our access to advantaged refining feedstocks while pipeline expansion and connection projects will grow capacity and allow for greater refined product exports 

we plan to spend 10 billion of direct capital expenditures in refining approximately 70 percent of which will be for sustaining capital these investments are related to reliability and maintenance safety and environmental projects including those to comply with tier 3 emission standards other refining capital investments will be directed toward relatively small highreturn projects primarily to enhance use of advantaged crudes as well as to improve product yields increase energy efficiency and expand export capability 

in the ms segment we plan to invest about 01 billion of growth and sustaining capital the growth investment reflects our intent to expand the international fuels marketing business 

within corporate and other we expect to invest approximately 01 billion in 2014 related to information technology and facilities

contingencies 

a number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims have been made against us in connection with matters that arise in the ordinary course of business we also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement storage disposal or release of certain chemical mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites we regularly assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies in the case of all known contingencies other than those related to income taxes we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable if a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount then the minimum of the range is accrued we do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or thirdparty recoveries if applicable we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other thirdparty recoveries in the case of incometaxrelated contingencies we use a cumulative probabilityweighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain 

based on currently available information we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements as we learn new facts concerning contingencies we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include contingent liabilities recorded for environmental remediation tax and legal matters estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes 

legal and tax matters 

our legal organization applies its knowledge experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases this process also enables us to track those cases that have been scheduled for trial andor mediation based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals or establishment of new accruals are required see note 20—income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about incometaxrelated contingencies 

environmental 

we are subject to the same numerous international federal state and local environmental laws and regulations as other companies in our industry the most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include among others the 

  

 

index to financial statements 

 these laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and in the case of discharges to water establish water quality limits they also in most cases require permits in association with new or modified operations these permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process which can be expensive and time consuming in addition there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency’s processing of the application many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant 

many states and foreign countries where we operate also have or are developing similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities while similar in some cases these regulations may impose additional or more stringent requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders 

the ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards such as air emission standards water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations continue to evolve however environmental laws and regulations including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the united states and in other countries in which we operate notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the united states 

an example in the fuels area is the energy policy act of 2005 which imposed obligations to provide increasing volumes of renewable fuels in transportation motor fuels through 2012 these obligations were changed with the enactment of the energy independence and security act of 2007 eisa eisa requires fuel producers and importers to provide additional renewable fuels for transportation motor fuels and stipulates a mix of various types to be included through 2022 we have met the increasingly stringent requirements to date while establishing implementation operating and capital strategies along with advanced technology development to address projected future requirements it is uncertain how various future requirements contained in eisa and the regulations promulgated thereunder may be implemented and what their full impact may be on our operations also we may experience a decrease in demand for refined petroleum products due to the regulatory program as currently promulgated for compliance year 2014 the us environmental protection agency epa proposed to reduce the statutory volumes of advanced and total renewable fuel using authority granted to it under eisa we do not know whether this reduction will be finalized as proposed or whether the epa will utilize its authority to reduce statutory volumes in future compliance years 

we also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations such laws and regulations include cercla and rcra and their state equivalents remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility arising from petroleum releases from underground storage tanks located at numerous past and present owned andor operated petroleummarketing outlets throughout the united states federal and state laws require contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards in addition to other cleanup standards many states have adopted cleanup criteria for methyl tertiarybutyl ether mtbe for both soil and groundwater 

at rcrapermitted facilities we are required to assess environmental conditions if conditions warrant we may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations in contrast to cercla which is often referred to as “superfund” the cost of corrective action activities under rcra corrective action programs typically is borne solely by us we anticipate increased expenditures for rcra remediation activities may be required but such annual expenditures for the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures we have experienced over the past few years longerterm expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly 

we occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the epa and state environmental agencies alleging we are a potentially responsible party under cercla or an equivalent state statute on occasion we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties these requests notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations as of december 31 2012  we reported we had been notified of potential liability under cercla and comparable state laws at 48 sites around the united states during 2013 we were notified of 3 new sites settled and closed 1 site and determined 15 sites were resolved leaving 35 unresolved sites with potential liability at december 31 2013  

index to financial statements 

for most superfund sites our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties is relatively low although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations and where they have not or where potentially responsible parties could not be located our share of liability has not increased materially many of the sites for which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the epa or the state agencies concerned prior to actual cleanup those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation in some instances we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain epa or equivalent state agency approval of a remediation plan there are relatively few sites where we are a major participant and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all cercla sites in the aggregate is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition 

expensed environmental costs were 665 million in 2013  and are expected to be approximately 645 million in each of 2014  and 2015  capitalized environmental costs were 252 million in 2013  and are expected to be approximately 365 million in each of 2014  and 2015  this amount does not include capital expenditures made for another purpose that have an indirect benefit on environmental compliance 

accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted except those assumed in a purchase business combination which we record on a discounted basis 

many of these liabilities result from cercla rcra and similar state laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct or once conducted operations or at sites where our generated waste was disposed we also have accrued for a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation but which are not currently the subject of cercla rcra or state enforcement activities if applicable we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other thirdparty recoveries in the future we may incur significant costs under both cercla and rcra remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site depending on the mix of unique site characteristics evolving remediation technologies diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties therefore it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs 

at december 31 2013  our balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of 492 million  compared with 530 million  at december 31 2012  and 542 million  at december 31 2011  we expect to incur a substantial amount of these expenditures within the next 30 years 

notwithstanding any of the foregoing and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in our operations and products and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred however we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations 

the epa’s renewable fuel standard rfs program was implemented in accordance with the energy policy act of 2005 and eisa the rfs program sets annual quotas for the percentage of biofuels such as ethanol that must be blended into motor fuels consumed in the united states a renewable identification number rin represents a serial number assigned to each gallon of biofuel produced or imported into the united states as a producer of petroleumbased motor fuels we are obligated to blend biofuels into the products we produce at a rate that is at least equal to the epa’s quota and to the extent we do not we must purchase rins in the open market to satisfy our obligation under the rfs program the market for rins has been the subject of fraudulent activity and we have identified that we have unknowingly purchased rins in the past that were invalid due to fraudulent activity although costs to replace fraudulently marketed rins that have been determined to be invalid have not been material through december 31 2013  it is reasonably possible that some additional rins that we have previously purchased may also be determined to be invalid should that occur we could incur additional replacement charges although the cost for replacing any additional fraudulently marketed rins is not reasonably estimable at this time we could have a possible exposure of approximately 150 million before tax it could take several years for this possible exposure to reach ultimate resolution therefore we would not expect to incur the full financial impact of additional fraudulent rin replacement costs in any single interim or annual period

climate change 

there has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state national and international laws focusing on greenhouse gas ghg reduction these proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future laws in this field continue to evolve and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation such laws if enacted could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include 

  

 

in the eu we have assets that are subject to the ets the first phase of the ets was completed at the end of 2007 and phase ii ran from 2008 through 2012 phase iii runs from 2013 through 2020 and there will likely be a significant increase in auctioning levels including 100 percent auctioning to the power sector in the united kingdom and across most of the eu we are actively engaged to minimize any financial impact from the trading scheme 

in the united states some additional form of regulation may be forthcoming in the future at the federal or state levels with respect to ghg emissions such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes the restriction of output investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances we are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations 

compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a ghg emission trading scheme or ghg reduction requirements could significantly increase our costs reduce demand for fossil energy derived products impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources an example of one such program is californias cap and trade program which was promulgated pursuant to the states global warming solutions act the program currently is limited to certain stationary sources which include our refineries in california but beginning in 2015 will expand to include emissions from transportation fuels distributed in california we expect inclusion of transportation fuels in californias cap and trade program as currently promulgated would increase our cap and trade program compliance costs the ultimate impact on our financial performance either positive or negative from this and similar programs will depend on a number of factors including but not limited to

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses see note 2—accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for descriptions of our major accounting policies certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions or if different assumptions had been used the following discussion of critical accounting estimates along with the discussion of contingencies in this report address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions could be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change 

impairments 

longlived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows is expected to be generated by an asset group if upon review the sum of the undiscounted pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets—generally at an entire refinery complex level because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for longlived assets the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants or based on a multiple of operating cash flows validated with historical market transactions of similar assets where possible the expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future volumes commodity prices operating costs margins discount rates and capital project decisions considering all available information at the date of review 

investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence of a loss in value such evidence of a loss in value might include our inability to recover the carrying amount the lack of sustained earnings capacity which would justify the current investment amount or a current fair value less than the investment’s carrying amount when it is determined such a loss in value is other than temporary an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the investment’s carrying value and its estimated fair value when determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline the investee’s financial condition and nearterm prospects and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value of the investment when quoted market prices are not available the fair value is usually based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee if appropriate differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period 

asset retirement obligations 

under various contracts permits and regulations we have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land at the end of operations at certain operational sites our largest asset removal obligations involve asbestos abatement at refineries estimating the future asset removal costs necessary for this accounting calculation is difficult most of these removal obligations are many years or decades in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs asset removal technologies and costs regulatory and other compliance considerations expenditure timing and other inputs into valuation of the obligation including discount and inflation rates are also subject to change 

index to financial statements 

environmental costs 

in addition to asset retirement obligations discussed above under the above or similar contracts permits and regulations we have certain obligations to complete environmentalrelated projects these projects are primarily related to cleanup at domestic refineries underground storage sites and nonoperated sites future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties 

intangible assets and goodwill 

at december 31 2013  we had 694 million  of intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives and thus they are not amortized this judgmental assessment of an indefinite useful life must be continuously evaluated in the future if due to changes in facts and circumstances management determines these intangible assets have finite useful lives amortization will commence at that time on a prospective basis as long as these intangible assets are judged to have indefinite lives they will be subject to annual impairment tests that require management’s judgment of the estimated fair value of these intangible assets 

at december 31 2013  we had 31 billion  of goodwill recorded in conjunction with past business combinations goodwill is not amortized instead goodwill is subject to at least annual reviews for impairment at a reporting unit level the reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed a reporting unit is an operating segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment 

effective january 1 2013 we realigned our operating segments and determined that goodwill which prior to the realignment had been assigned fully to our former rm segment should now be assigned to three of the realigned operating segments—midstream refining and ms we further determined that for the midstream segment transportation constituted a reporting unit for the refining and ms segments we determined the goodwill reporting unit was at the operating segment level due to the economic similarities of the components of those segments 

goodwill was reassigned to the realigned reporting units using a relative fair value approach goodwill impairment testing was completed and no impairment recognition was required in the future the sale or disposition of a significant asset within a reporting unit will be allocated a portion of that reporting units goodwill based on relative fair values which will adjust the amount of gain or loss on the sale or disposition 

because quoted market prices for our reporting units were not available management applied judgment in determining the estimated fair values of the reporting units for purposes of performing the goodwill impairment test management used all available information to make this fair value determination including observed market earnings multiples of comparable companies our common stock price and associated total company market capitalization and the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the assets 

during the fourth quarter of 2013 we estimated that the fair values of the transportation refining and ms reporting units were approximately 220 percent 30 percent and 45 percent higher than the recorded net book values including goodwill of these reporting units respectively however a lower fair value estimate in the future could result in an impairment a prolonged or significant decline in our stock price could provide evidence of a need to record a material impairment of goodwill 

tax assets and liabilities 

our operations are subject to various taxes including federal state and foreign income taxes and transactional taxes such as excise salesuse property and payroll taxes we record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations the recording of tax liabilities requires significant judgment and estimates we recognize the financial statement effects of an income tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority a contingent liability related to a transactional tax claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and estimable actual incurred tax liabilities can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons including different interpretations of tax laws and regulations and different assessments of the amount of tax due 

in determining our income tax provision we assess the likelihood our deferred tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income valuation allowances reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized 

index to financial statements 

judgment is required in estimating the amount of valuation allowance if any that should be recorded against our deferred tax assets based on our historical taxable income our expectations for the future and available taxplanning strategies we expect the net deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as reductions to future taxable income if our actual results of operations differ from such estimates or our estimates of future taxable income change the valuation allowance may need to be revised 

new tax laws and regulations as well as changes to existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being proposed or promulgated the implementation of future legislative and regulatory tax initiatives could result in increased tax liabilities that cannot be predicted at this time 

projected benefit obligations 

determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement the actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events including estimated retirement dates salary levels at retirement mortality rates lumpsum election rates rates of return on plan assets future health care costtrend rates and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees due to the specialized nature of these calculations we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects ultimately we will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions a 1 percent decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by an estimated 60 million while a 1 percent decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by an estimated 30 million in determining the discount rate we use yields on highquality fixed income investments with payments matched to the estimated distributions of benefits from our plans 

in 2013 and 2012 the company used an expected longterm rate of return of 7 percent for the us pension plan assets which account for 75 percent of the company’s pension plan assets the actual asset returns for 2013 and 2012 were 16 percent and 5 percent respectively for the eight years prior to the separation actual asset returns averaged 7 percent for the us pension plan assets the 2013 asset returns of 16 percent were associated with a broad recovery in the financial markets during the year 

outlook 

on december 30 2013 we entered into an agreement pursuant to which we will exchange all of our common stock in pspi for shares of phillips 66 common stock owned by the other party we expect pspis balance sheet at closing to include approximately 450 million of cash and cash equivalents the exact number of phillips 66 shares to be delivered will be determined by reference to the volume weighted average price of phillips 66 common stock on the closing date had the closing occurred on february 14 2014 approximately 18 million shares of phillips 66 common stock would have been exchanged the reacquired stock will be held as treasury shares following customary regulatory review the transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2014 we expect to record a gain of approximately 710 million when the transaction closes subject to working capital and other adjustments 

on february 13 2014 we entered into an agreement to contribute to phillips 66 partners certain transportation terminaling and storage assets for total consideration of 700 million these assets consist of our gold product pipeline system and the medford spheres two newly constructed refinerygrade propylene storage spheres phillips 66 partners expects to finance the acquisition with cash on hand of 400 million the issuance of additional units valued at 140 million and a fiveyear 160 million note payable to a subsidiary of phillips 66 the number of additional units will be based on the average daily closing price of phillips 66 partners’ common units for the 10 trading days prior to february 13 2014 or 3886 per unit with 98 percent issued as common units and 2 percent issued as general partner units the transaction is targeted to occur on march 1 2014

our use of derivative instruments is governed by an “authority limitations” document approved by our board of directors that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient market liquidity for comparable valuations the authority limitations document also establishes the value at risk var limits for us and compliance with these limits is monitored daily our chief financial officer monitors risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates our executive vice president over the commercial organization monitors commodity price risk the commercial organization manages our commercial marketing optimizes our commodity flows and positions and monitors related risks of our businesses 

commodity price risk 

we sell into or receive supply from the worldwide crude oil refined products natural gas ngl and electric power markets and are exposed to fluctuations in the prices for these commodities 

these fluctuations can affect our revenues and purchases as well as the cost of operating investing and financing activities generally our policy is to remain exposed to the market prices of commodities 

our commercial organization uses futures forwards swaps and options in various markets to optimize the value of our supply chain which may move our risk profile away from market average prices to accomplish the following objectives 

  

 

we use a var model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments held or issued including commodity purchase and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at december 31 2013  as derivative instruments using monte carlo simulation a 95 percent confidence level and a oneday holding period the var for those instruments issued or held for trading purposes at december 31 2013  and 2012  were immaterial to our cash flows and net income

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form 10k each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock 

our operating results and our future rate of growth are exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices and refining and petrochemical margins 

our revenues operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent on a number of factors including fixed and variable expenses including the cost of crude oil and other refinery feedstocks and the margin relative to those expenses at which we are able to sell refined products in recent years the prices of crude oil and refined products have fluctuated substantially these prices depend on numerous factors beyond our control including the global supply and demand for crude oil gasoline and other refined products which are subject to among other things 

  

 

the price of crude oil influences prices for refined products we do not produce crude oil and must purchase all of the crude oil we process many crude oils available on the world market will not meet the quality restrictions for use in our refineries others are not economical to use due to excessive transportation costs or for other reasons the prices for crude oil and refined products can fluctuate differently based on global regional and local market conditions in addition the timing of the relative movement of the prices both among different classes of refined products and among various global markets for similar refined products as well as the overall change in refined product prices can reduce refining margins and could have a significant impact on our refining wholesale marketing and retail operations revenues operating income and cash flows also crude oil supply contracts generally have marketresponsive pricing provisions we normally purchase our refinery feedstocks weeks before manufacturing and selling the refined products price level changes during the period between purchasing feedstocks and selling the refined products from these feedstocks could have a significant effect on our financial results we also purchase refined products produced by others for sale to our customers price level changes during the periods between purchasing and selling these refined products also could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

uncertainty and illiquidity in credit and capital markets can impair our ability to obtain credit and financing on acceptable terms and can adversely affect the financial strength of our business partners 

our ability to obtain credit and capital depends in large measure on the state of the credit and capital markets which is beyond our control our ability to access credit and capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like or need access to those markets which could constrain our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions in addition the cost and availability of debt and equity financing may be adversely impacted by unstable or illiquid market conditions protracted uncertainty and illiquidity in these markets also could have an adverse impact on our lenders commodity hedging counterparties or our customers preventing them from meeting their obligations to us 

from time to time our cash needs may exceed our internally generated cash flow and our business could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to obtain necessary funds from financing activities from time to time we may need to supplement our cash generated from operations with proceeds from financing activities uncertainty and illiquidity in financial markets may materially impact the ability of the participating financial institutions to fund their commitments to us under our liquidity facilities accordingly we may not be able to obtain the full amount of the funds available under our liquidity facilities to satisfy our cash requirements and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position 

index to financial statements 

deterioration in our credit profile could increase our costs of borrowing money and limit our access to the capital markets and commercial credit and could trigger coventurer rights under joint venture arrangements 

our credit ratings could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment the circumstances warrant if a rating agency were to downgrade our rating below investment grade our borrowing costs would increase and our funding sources could decrease in addition a failure by us to maintain an investment grade rating could affect our business relationships with suppliers and operating partners for example our agreement with chevron regarding cpchem permits chevron to buy our 50 percent interest in cpchem for fair market value if we experience a change in control or if both sp and moodys lower our credit ratings below investment grade and the credit rating from either rating agency remains below investment grade for 365 days thereafter with fair market value determined by agreement or by nationally recognized investment banks as a result of these factors a downgrade of our credit ratings could have a materially adverse impact on our future operations and financial position 

we expect to continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of our compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations likewise future environmental laws and regulations may impact or limit our current business plans and reduce demand for our products 

our business is subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment these laws and regulations continue to increase in both number and complexity and affect our operations with respect to among other things 

  

 

we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital operating and maintenance and remediation expenditures as a result of these laws and regulations to the extent these expenditures as with all costs are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in future periods could be materially adversely affected 

to the extent there are significant changes in the earths climate such as more severe or frequent weather conditions in the markets we serve or the areas where our assets reside we could incur increased expenses our operations could be materially impacted and demand for our products could fall 

domestic and worldwide political and economic developments could damage our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows 

actions of the us state local and international governments through tax and other legislation executive order and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability both in the united states and abroad the us government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries these restrictions and those of foreign governments could limit our ability to operate in or gain access to opportunities in various countries as well as limit our ability to obtain the optimum slate of crude oil and other refinery feedstocks our foreign operations and those of our joint ventures are further subject to risks of loss of revenue equipment and property as a result of expropriation acts of terrorism war civil unrest and other political risks unilateral or forced renegotiation modification or nullification of existing contracts with governmental entities and difficulties enforcing rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations actions by both the united states and host governments may affect our operations significantly in the future 

renewable fuels alternative energy mandates and energy conservation efforts could reduce demand for refined products tax incentives and other subsidies can make renewable fuels and alternative energy more competitive with refined products than they otherwise might be which may reduce refined product margins and hinder the ability of refined products to compete with renewable fuels

large capital projects can take many years to complete and market conditions could deteriorate significantly between the project approval date and the project startup date negatively impacting project returns 

to approve a largescale capital project the project must meet an acceptable level of return on the capital to be employed in the project we base these forecasted project economics on our best estimate of future market conditions most largescale projects take many years to complete during this multiyear period market conditions can change from those we forecast and these changes could be significant accordingly we may not be able to realize our expected returns from a large investment in a capital project and this could negatively impact our results of operations cash flows and our return on capital employed 

our investments in joint ventures decrease our ability to manage risk 

we conduct some of our operations including a large part of our midstream segment and our entire chemicals segment through joint ventures in which we share control with our joint venture participants our joint venture participants may have economic business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with those of the joint venture or us or our joint venture participants may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone failure by us or an entity in which we have a jointventure interest to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisitions or joint ventures could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our joint ventures and in turn our business and operations 

activities in our chemicals and midstream segments involve numerous risks that may result in accidents or otherwise affect the ability of our equity affiliates to make distributions to us 

there are a variety of hazards and operating risks inherent in the manufacture of petrochemicals and the gathering processing transmission storage and distribution of natural gas and ngl such as spills leaks explosions and mechanical problems that could cause substantial financial losses in addition these risks could result in significant injury loss of human life damage to property environmental pollution and impairment of operations any of which could result in substantial losses for assets located near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers industrial sites and other public gathering areas the level of damage resulting from these risks could be greater should any of these risks materialize it could have a material adverse effect on the business and financial condition of cpchem dcp midstream or rex and negatively impact their ability to make future distributions to us 

our operations present hazards and risks which may not be fully covered by insurance if insured if a significant accident or event occurs for which we are not adequately insured our operations and financial results could be adversely affected 

the scope and nature of our operations present a variety of operational hazards and risks including explosions fires toxic emissions maritime hazards and natural catastrophes that must be managed through continual oversight and control for example the operation of refineries power plants fractionators pipelines and terminals is inherently subject to the risks of spills discharges or other inadvertent releases of petroleum or hazardous substances if any of these events had previously occurred or occurs in the future in connection with any of our refineries pipelines or refined products terminals or in connection with any facilities that receive our wastes or byproducts for treatment or disposal other than events for which we are indemnified we could be liable for all costs and penalties associated with their remediation under federal state local and international environmental laws or common law and could be liable for property damage to thirdparties caused by contamination from releases and spills these and other risks are present throughout our operations as protection against these hazards and risks we maintain insurance against many but not all potential losses or liabilities arising from such operating risks as such our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover us against potential losses arising from such risks uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating risks could reduce the funds available to us for capital and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to interruptions of supply and increased costs as a result of our reliance on thirdparty transportation of crude oil and refined products 

we often utilize the services of third parties to transport crude oil ngl and refined products to and from our facilities in addition to our own operational risks discussed above we could experience interruptions of supply or increases in costs to deliver refined products to market if the ability of the pipelines or vessels to transport crude oil or refined products is disrupted because of weather events accidents governmental regulations or thirdparty actions a prolonged disruption of the ability of a pipeline or vessel to transport crude oil or refined product to or from one or more of our refineries could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in us production of crude oil and natural gas which could adversely impact our results of operations 

an increasing percentage of crude oil supplied to our refineries and the oil and gas production of dcp midstreams customers is being developed from unconventional sources such as deep oil and gas shales these reservoirs require hydraulic fracturing completion processes to release the hydrocarbons from the rock so it can flow through casing to the surface hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water sand and chemicals under pressure into the formation to stimulate hydrocarbon production the us environmental protection agency as well as several state agencies have commenced studies andor convened hearings regarding the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities at the same time certain environmental groups have suggested that additional laws may be needed to more closely and uniformly regulate the hydraulic fracturing process and legislation has been proposed to provide for such regulation we cannot predict whether any such legislation will ever be enacted and if so what its provisions would be any additional levels of regulation and permits required with the adoption of new laws and regulations at the federal or state level could result in our having to rely on higher priced crude oil for our refineries and lead to delays increased operating costs and process prohibitions that could reduce the volumes of natural gas that move through dcp midstreams gathering systems this could materially adversely affect our results of operations and the ability of dcp midstream to make cash distributions to us 

because of the natural decline in production from existing wells in dcp midstreams areas of operation its success depends on its ability to obtain new sources of natural gas and ngl any decrease in the volumes of natural gas dcp midstream gathers could adversely affect its business and operating results 

dcp midstreams gathering and transportation pipeline systems are connected to or dependent on the level of production from natural gas wells from which production will naturally decline over time as a result its cash flows associated with these wells will also decline over time in order to maintain or increase throughput levels on its gathering and transportation pipeline systems and ngl pipelines and the asset utilization rates at its natural gas processing plants dcp midstream must continually obtain new supplies the primary factors affecting dcp midstreams ability to obtain new supplies of natural gas and ngl and to attract new customers to its assets include the level of successful drilling activity near these assets the demand for natural gas and crude oil producers desire and ability to obtain necessary permits in an efficient manner natural gas field characteristics and production performance surface access and infrastructure issues and its ability to compete for volumes from successful new wells if dcp midstream is not able to obtain new supplies of natural gas to replace the natural decline in volumes from existing wells or because of competition throughput on its pipelines and the utilization rates of its treating and processing facilities would decline this could have a material adverse effect on its business results of operations financial position and cash flows and its ability to make cash distributions to us 

competitors that produce their own supply of feedstocks have more extensive retail outlets or have greater financial resources may have a competitive advantage 

the refining and marketing industry is highly competitive with respect to both feedstock supply and refined product markets we compete with many companies for available supplies of crude oil and other feedstocks and for outlets for our refined products we do not produce any of our crude oil feedstocks some of our competitors however obtain a portion of their feedstocks from their own production and some have more extensive retail outlets than we have competitors that have their own production or extensive retail outlets and greater brandname recognition are at times able to offset losses from refining operations with profits from producing or retailing operations and may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages 

some of our competitors also have materially greater financial and other resources than we have such competitors have a greater ability to bear the economic risks inherent in all phases of our business in addition we compete with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel requirements of our industrial commercial and individual customers 

we may incur losses as a result of our forwardcontract activities and derivative transactions 

we currently use commodity derivative instruments and we expect to continue their use in the future if the instruments we utilize to hedge our exposure to various types of risk are not effective we may incur losses derivative transactions involve the risk that counterparties may be unable to satisfy their obligations to us if any of our counterparties were to default on its obligations to us under the hedging contracts or seek bankruptcy protection it could have an adverse effect on our ability to fund our planned activities and could result in a larger percentage of our future production being subject to commodity price changes the risk of counterparty default is heightened in a poor economic environment

a significant interruption in one or more of our facilities could adversely affect our business 

our operations could be subject to significant interruption if one or more of our facilities were to experience a major accident or mechanical failure power outage encounter work stoppages relating to organized labor issues be damaged by severe weather or other natural or manmade disaster such as an act of terrorism or otherwise be forced to shut down if any facility were to experience an interruption in operations earnings from the facility could be materially adversely affected to the extent not recoverable through insurance if insured because of lost production and repair costs a significant interruption in one or more of our facilities could also lead to increased volatility in prices for feedstocks and refined products and could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets making it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain insurance coverage that we consider adequate 

our performance depends on the uninterrupted operation of our facilities which are becoming increasingly dependent on our information technology systems 

our performance depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of the manufacturing equipment in our production facilities the inability to operate one or more of our facilities due to a natural disaster power outage labor dispute or failure of one or more of our information technology telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to manufacture our products our manufacturing equipment is becoming increasingly dependent on our information technology systems a disruption in our information technology systems due to a catastrophic event or security breach could interrupt or damage our operations in addition we could be subject to reputational harm or liability if confidential customer information is misappropriated from our information technology systems despite our security measures and business continuity plans these systems could be vulnerable to disruption and any such disruption could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

the level of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the expected return on plan assets for our pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans are evaluated by us in consultation with outside actuaries if we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected longterm rate of return or health care cost trend rate our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses and funding requirements could increase in addition several factors could result in actual results differing significantly from the actuarial assumptions that we use funding obligations are determined based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date as required under relevant regulations future pension funding requirements and the timing of funding payments could be affected by legislation enacted by governmental authorities 

in connection with the separation conocophillips has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities and we have agreed to indemnify conocophillips for certain liabilities if we are required to act on these indemnities to conocophillips we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations and our financial results could be negatively impacted the conocophillips indemnity may not be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of liabilities for which it has been allocated responsibility and conocophillips may not be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future 

pursuant to the indemnification and release agreement and certain other agreements with conocophillips entered into in connection with the separation conocophillips agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities and we agreed to indemnify conocophillips for certain liabilities indemnities that we may be required to provide conocophillips are not subject to any cap may be significant and could negatively impact our business particularly indemnities relating to our actions that could impact the taxfree nature of the distribution of phillips 66 stock third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that conocophillips has agreed to retain further the indemnity from conocophillips may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities and conocophillips may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations moreover even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from conocophillips any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves each of these risks could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to continuing contingent liabilities of conocophillips following the separation 

notwithstanding the separation there are several significant areas where the liabilities of conocophillips may become our obligations for example under the internal revenue code and the related rules and regulations each corporation that was a member of the conocophillips consolidated us federal income tax reporting group during any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the effective time of the separation is jointly and severally liable for the us federal 

index to financial statements 

income tax liability of the entire conocophillips consolidated tax reporting group for that taxable period in connection with the separation we entered into the tax sharing agreement with conocophillips that allocates the responsibility for prior period taxes of the conocophillips consolidated tax reporting group between us and conocophillips conocophillips may be unable to pay any prior period taxes for which it is responsible and we could be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes other provisions of federal law establish similar liability for other matters including laws governing taxqualified pension plans as well as other contingent liabilities 

if the distribution in connection with the separation together with certain related transactions does not qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes our stockholders and conocophillips could be subject to significant tax liability and in certain circumstances we could be required to indemnify conocophillips for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax sharing agreement 

conocophillips received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service irs substantially to the effect that among other things the distribution together with certain related transactions qualified as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code the private letter ruling and the tax opinion that conocophillips received relied on certain representations assumptions and undertakings including those relating to the past and future conduct of our business and neither the private letter ruling nor the opinion would be valid if such representations assumptions and undertakings were incorrect moreover the private letter ruling does not address all the issues that are relevant to determining whether the distribution qualified for taxfree treatment notwithstanding the private letter ruling and the tax opinion the irs could determine the distribution should be treated as a taxable transaction for us federal income tax purposes if it determines any of the representations assumptions or undertakings that were included in the request for the private letter ruling are false or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion that are not covered by the irs ruling 

if the irs were to determine that the distribution failed to qualify for taxfree treatment in general conocophillips would be subject to tax as if it had sold the phillips 66 common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value and conocophillips stockholders who received shares of phillips 66 common stock in the distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares 

under the tax sharing agreement we would generally be required to indemnify conocophillips against any tax resulting from the distribution to the extent that such tax resulted from i an acquisition of all or a portion of our stock or assets whether by merger or otherwise ii other actions or failures to act by us or iii any of our representations or undertakings being incorrect or violated our indemnification obligations to conocophillips and its subsidiaries officers and directors are not limited by any maximum amount if we are required to indemnify conocophillips or such other persons under the circumstances set forth in the tax sharing agreement we may be subject to substantial liabilities 

we may not be able to engage in desirable strategic or capitalraising transactions due to limitations imposed on us as part of the separation in addition under some circumstances we could be liable for adverse tax consequences resulting from engaging in significant strategic or capitalraising transactions 

to preserve the taxfree treatment to conocophillips of the distribution for the twoyear period following the distribution we may be prohibited except in specified circumstances from 

  

 

these restrictions may limit our ability to pursue strategic transactions or engage in new business or other transactions that may maximize the value of our business

prior to the separation on april 30 2012 our results of operations financial position and cash flows consisted of conocophillips refining marketing and transportation operations its natural gas gathering processing transmission and marketing operations including its equity investment in dcp midstream its petrochemical operations conducted through its equity investment in cpchem its power generation operations and an allocable portion of its corporate costs together the “downstream businesses” these financial statements have been presented as if the downstream businesses had been combined for all periods presented all intercompany transactions and accounts within the downstream businesses were eliminated the assets and liabilities have been reflected on a historical cost basis as all of the assets and liabilities presented were wholly owned by conocophillips and were transferred within the conocophillips consolidated group the statement of income for periods prior to the separation includes expense allocations for certain corporate functions historically performed by conocophillips and not allocated to its operating segments including allocations of general corporate expenses related to executive oversight accounting treasury tax legal procurement and information technology these allocations were based primarily on specific identification of time andor activities associated with the downstream businesses employee headcount or capital expenditures and our management believes the assumptions underlying the allocations were reasonable the combined financial statements may not necessarily reflect all of the actual expenses that would have been incurred had we been a standalone company during the periods presented prior to the separation all financial information presented after the separation represents the consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows of phillips 66 

executive overview 

we reported earnings of 41 billion  in 2012 refining margins remained strong in 2012 particularly in the midcontinent region chemicals margins also remained robust in 2012 we generated cash from operations in 2012 of 43 billion  which we used to fund capital expenditures and investments of 17 billion  pay dividends of 282 million  repurchase 356 million  of our common shares make a 10 billion prepayment on our debt and increase our cash and cash equivalents balance to 35 billion  at december 31 2012 we ended 2012 with approximately 50 billion of total capacity under our available liquidity facilities 

our solid financial results in 2012 allowed us to accelerate our strategy of creating value for shareholders 

 

 

we continue to focus on the following strategic areas 

 

 

 

index to financial statements 

   

business environment 

results for our rm segment depend largely on refining and marketing margins cost control refinery throughput and product yields the crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined petroleum products and crude oil and it is used within our industry as an indicator for refining margins both domestic and international industry average crack spreads increased from 2010 to 2011 and again from 2011 to 2012 the improvements were consistent with improved global demand for refined products resulting from worldwide economic recovery along with limited net increases in global refining capacity us margins in the midcontinent were especially strong which can be attributed to the regions crude feedstock advantage 

in addition us crude production continued to increase and limited infrastructure for takeaway options resulted in advantaged crude prices for us refiners with access to advantaged crudes midcontinent refiners were especially advantaged increasing pressure on inventories in the midcontinent continued to cause wti crude to trade at a deep discount relative to crudes such as light louisiana sweet lls and brent refineries capable of processing wti crude and crude oils that price relative to wti primarily the midcontinent and gulf coast refineries benefited from these lower regional feedstock prices 

the midstream segments results are closely linked to ngl prices relative to crude oil prices and to a lesser extent natural gas prices ngl prices improved in both 2010 and 2011 along with crude oil prices but decreased in 2012 while crude prices stayed relatively stable the ngl price decrease in 2012 was primarily due to growing ngl production from liquidsrich shale plays while a corresponding demand increase from the petrochemical industry has not yet materialized as projects remain under development 

the chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in cpchem the chemicals and plastics industry is mainly a commoditybased industry where the margins for key products are based on market factors the chemicals and plastics industry experienced robust margin improvement from 2010 to 2011 and then again in 2012 generally ethylene margins improved in regions of the world where production is based upon ngl versus crudederived feedstocks in particular north american ethanebased crackers benefited from the lowerpriced feedstocks

income statement analysis 

2012  vs 2011   

sales and other operating revenues   decreased   8 percent  in 2012  while purchased crude oil and products   decreased   11 percent  the decreases were mainly due to processing lower refining volumes at our wholly owned refineries resulting from the shutdown of trainer refinery in september 2011 combined with lower crude oil and ngl prices 

equity in earnings of affiliates   increased   10 percent  in 2012  primarily resulting from improved earnings from wrb and cpchem equity in earnings of wrb increased 43 percent mainly due to higher refining margins in the central corridor combined with processing higher volumes associated with the startup of the coker and refining expansion core project at the wood river refinery equity in earnings of cpchem increased 22 percent primarily resulting from higher ethylene and polyethylene margins these improvements were partially offset by 

 

net gain on dispositions   decreased   88 percent  in 2012  primarily resulting from 2011 gains associated with the disposition of three pipeline systems compared with a net gain associated with the sale of trainer refinery and associated terminal and pipeline assets in the second quarter of 2012 for additional information see note 6—assets held for sale or sold  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

other income   increased   90 million  in 2012  primarily associated with a keepwhole payment received from a third party associated with the sale of its ownership interest in rex gains from trading activities not directly related to our physical business and income received from conocophillips associated with shared services 

selling general and administrative expenses   increased   22 percent  in 2012  primarily resulting from onetime and incremental costs associated with the separation as well as incremental costs relating to a prior retail disposition program

segment results 

rm 

  



index to financial statements 



the rm segment refines crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products such as gasoline distillates and aviation fuels buys sells and transports crude oil and buys transports distributes and markets petroleum products this segment also includes power generation operations rm has operations mainly in the united states europe and asia 

2012  vs 2011   

rm reported earnings of 3729 million  in 2012  a decrease of 119 million  or 3 percent  compared with 2011  see the “business environment and executive overview” section for information on industry crack spreads and other market factors impacting this years results 

the decrease in earnings in 2012  was primarily due to lower net gains on disposition of assets higher impairments and increased maintenance and repair expense associated with our bayway refinery as a result of severe weather disruptions these items were partially offset by improved worldwide refining margins driven by improved market conditions and optimizing access to lowercost crude oil feedstocks 

during 2012 rm included an aftertax gain of 106 million from the sale of the trainer refinery and associated terminal and pipeline assets compared with an aftertax gain of 1595 million in 2011 on the sale of seaway products pipeline company and our ownership interest in colonial pipeline company and seaway crude pipeline company for additional information see note 6—assets held for sale or sold  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

additionally during 2012 rm results included an aftertax impairment of 564 million on our equity investment in mrc an aftertax impairment of 27 million on the riverhead terminal and a 42 million aftertax impairment related to equipment formerly associated with the canceled wrg upgrade project compared with an aftertax impairment of 303 million on the trainer refinery during 2011 for additional information see note 10—impairments  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

our worldwide refining capacity utilization rate was 93 percent  in 2012  compared with 92 percent  in 2011  the current year improvement was primarily due to improved market conditions partially offset by higher turnaround and maintenance activities as well as severe weather disruptions 

2011  vs 2010   

rm reported earnings of 3848 million  in 2011  an increase of 3702 million compared with 2010 the increase in 2011 was primarily due to significantly higher us refining margins higher refining volumes higher net gains from asset sales foreign currency gains and the absence of the 2010 wrg impairment partially offset by lower international refining margins and the 303 million aftertax impairment and warehouse inventory writedown associated with the idling of the trainer refinery in 2011 

in 2011 gains from asset sales of 1627 million after tax mainly resulted from the sales of seaway products pipeline company and our equity investments in seaway crude pipeline company and colonial pipeline company these gains were partially offset by the loss on the sale of wrg and related warehouse inventory writedowns in 2010 gains from asset sales of 113 million after tax were mainly associated with the sale of our 50 percent interest in cfj properties 

our worldwide refining capacity utilization rate was 92 percent  in 2011  compared with 81 percent  for 2010  the 2011 rate mainly reflected lower turnaround activity and the removal of wrg from our refining capacities effective january 1 2011 partially offset by higher planned and unplanned downtime

midstream 

  



 based on index prices from the mont belvieu and conway market hubs that are weighted by ngl component and location mix 



   includes our share of equity affiliates 

 excludes dcp midstream 

the midstream segment purchases raw natural gas from producers and gathers natural gas through an extensive network of pipeline gathering systems the natural gas is then processed to extract ngl from the raw gas stream the remaining residue gas is marketed to electric utilities industrial users and gas marketing companies most of the ngl are fractionated—separated into individual components such as ethane propane and butane—and marketed as chemical feedstock fuel or blendstock the midstream segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in dcp midstream as well as other ngl fractionation trading and marketing businesses in the united states the midstream segment also includes our 25 percent interest in rex and a onethird direct interest in both the southern hills and sand hills pipeline projects 

2012  vs 2011   

earnings from the midstream segment decreased   397 million  in 2012  compared with 2011  the decrease was primarily due to impairments of our equity investment in rex during 2012 and decreased equity earnings from dcp midstream partially offset by a keepwhole payment received from a third party associated with the sale of its ownership interest in rex 

during 2012 we recorded aftertax impairments totaling 303 million on our equity investment in rex the impairments primarily reflect a diminished view of fair value of westtoeast natural gas transmission due to the impact of shale gas production in the northeast for additional information see note 10—impairments  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the decrease in earnings of dcp midstream in 2012 mainly resulted from lower ngl prices and to a lesser extent lower natural gas prices partially offset by lower depreciation and increased gain from the issuance of limited partner units by dcp midstream partners lp as described below and favorable volume impacts due to higher ngl extracted from liquid rich areas such as permian basin eagle ford shale and denverjulesburg basin see the “business environment and executive overview” section for additional information on ngl prices 

during the second quarter of 2012 dcp midstream completed a review of the estimated depreciable lives of its major classes of properties plants and equipment as a result of that review the depreciable lives were extended this change in accounting estimate was implemented on a prospective basis effective april 1 2012 dcp midstream estimates its depreciation will be lowered approximately 240 million per year on a 100 percent basis which would be an estimated aftertax benefit to our equity in earnings from dcp midstream of approximately 75 million 

index to financial statements 

dcp midstream partners lp a subsidiary of dcp midstream issues from time to time limited partner units to the public these issuances benefited our equity in earnings from dcp midstream by approximately 24 million after tax in 2012 compared with approximately 11 million after tax in 2011 

2011  vs 2010   

midstream earnings increased 54 percent in 2011 compared with 2010 the increase was primarily due to higher equity earnings from dcp midstream as a result of significantly higher ngl prices indexed ngl prices were 23 percent higher in 2011 than in 2010 also benefiting 2011 earnings were higher fees received for ngl fractionation services reflecting favorably renegotiated contracts these items were partially offset by higher costs at dcp midstream primarily due to higher maintenance and repair costs and increased depreciation expense 

chemicals 

  



the chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in cpchem which we account for under the equity method cpchem uses ngl and other feedstocks to produce petrochemicals these products are then marketed and sold or used as feedstocks to produce plastics and other chemicals 

2012  vs 2011   

earnings from the chemicals segment increased   107 million  or 15 percent  in 2012  compared with 2011  the increase was primarily driven by higher ethylene and polyethylene margins and lower utility costs partially offset by a loss on early extinguishment of debt and fixed asset impairments ethylene margins benefited from lower feedstock costs particularly lower ethane and propane prices during 2012 utility costs benefited from lower natural gas prices during 2012 

during 2012 cpchem retired 1 billion of fixedrate debt cpchem also incurred prepayment premiums and wrote off the associated unamortized debt issuance costs as a result cpchem recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt in 2012 of 287 million 100 percent basis which decreased our equity in earnings from cpchem on an aftertax basis by approximately 90 million 

  

in addition during 2012 cpchem recorded fixed asset impairments totaling 91 million 100 percent basis which decreased our equity in earnings from cpchem on an aftertax basis by 28 million these asset impairments primarily included certain specialties aromatics and styrenics asset groups and were mainly driven by decreases in cash flow projections 

2011  vs 2010 

chemicals segment earnings increased 230 million or 47 percent in 2011 compared with 2010 the improvement primarily resulted from higher margins volumes and equity earnings from cpchem’s olefins and polyolefins business line the specialties aromatics and styrenics business line also contributed to the increase in earnings due to higher margins

corporate and other 

  



2012  vs 2011 

net interest expense consists of interest and financing expense net of interest income and capitalized interest net interest expense increased   137 million  in 2012  compared with 2011  primarily due to approximately 78 billion of new debt issued in march and april of 2012 for additional information see note 13—debt  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

corporate general and administrative expenses increased   40 million  in 2012  compared with 2011  the increase was primarily due to incremental costs and expenses associated with operating as a standalone company for the eight months subsequent to the separation 

repositioning costs consist of expenses related to the separation expenses incurred in the eightmonth period subsequent to the separation primarily included compensation and benefits employee relocations and moves information systems and shared services costs 

changes in the other category were mainly due to an aftertax impairment of 16 million on a corporate property in 2012 

2011  vs 2010 

net interest expense increased 11 million in 2011 primarily as a result of various taxrelated adjustments in 2010 technology’s net loss increased in 2011 mainly due to higher project expenses and lower licensing revenues the category “other” includes certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation and other costs not directly associated with an operating segment changes in the “other” category were mainly due to higher environmental expenses associated with sites no longer in operation

capital resources and liquidity 

financial indicators 



to meet our short and longterm liquidity requirements we look to a variety of funding sources but rely primarily on cash generated from operating activities proceeds from asset dispositions funds from the issuance of debt and prior to april 30 2012 proceeds from conocophillips have also been sources of liquidity 

during 2012 we generated 43 billion  in operating cash flows and received 78 billion in proceeds from the issuance of debt during 2012 the primary uses of this available cash were 17 billion in capital expenditures and investments 53 billion of distributions to conocophillips as part of the separation 12 billion of debt repayment 04 billion  to repurchase common stock and 03 billion  to pay dividends on our common stock we ended 2012 with cash and cash equivalents of 35 billion  

in addition to cash flows from operating activities and proceeds from asset sales we rely on our credit facility programs and our shelf registration statement to support our short and longterm liquidity requirements we believe current cash and cash equivalents and cash generated by operations together with access to external sources of funds as described below in the “significant sources of capital” section will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near and long term including our capital spending dividend payments defined benefit plan contributions repayment of debt and share repurchases 

significant sources of capital 

operating activities 

during 2012  cash of  4296 million  was provided by operating activities a 14 percent   decrease  from cash from operations of  5006 million  in 2011  the decrease in the 2012 period primarily reflects the impact of working capital changes accounts payable activity lowered cash from operations by 985 million in 2012 primarily reflecting lower commodity prices and volumes inventory management had a reduced benefit to working capital in 2012 compared with 2011 discussed in more detail below partially offsetting the negative impact of working capital changes in 2012 were 

 

during 2011  cash of  5006 million  was provided by operating activities a 139 percent   increase  from cash from operations of  2092 million  in 2010  the increase was primarily due to a significant improvement in us refining margins in 2011 particularly in the central corridor region increased distributions from equity affiliates including cpchem dcp midstream and wrb and inventory liquidations in 2011 compared with inventory builds in 2010 

our short and longterm operating cash flows are highly dependent upon refining and marketing margins ngl prices and chemicals margins prices and margins in our industry are typically volatile and are driven by market conditions over which we have little or no control absent other mitigating factors as these prices and margins fluctuate we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows 

index to financial statements 

generally demand for gasoline is higher during the spring and summer months than during the fall and winter months in most of our markets due to seasonal changes in highway traffic as a result the rm segments operating results in the first and fourth quarters are generally lower than in the second and third quarters however our cash flow from operations may not always follow this seasonal trend in operating results due to working capital fluctuations associated with inventory management historically we have built inventory levels during the first quarter thus lowering cash flow from operations and lowered inventory levels in the fourth quarter increasing cash flow from operations in 2012 we used operating cash flows of 15 billion in the first quarter to build inventories while the liquidation of inventories in the fourth quarter provided operating cash flows of 23 billion for the full year 2012 inventory management had a lower benefit to cash from operations compared with 2011 reflecting that a portion of our normal fourthquarter inventory draw took place late in the year such that cash realizations did not transpire prior to december 31 

the level and quality of output from our refineries also impacts our cash flows the output at our refineries is impacted by such factors as operating efficiency maintenance turnarounds market conditions feedstock availability and weather conditions we actively manage the operations of our refineries and typically any variability in their operations has not been as significant to cash flows as that caused by margins and prices our worldwide crude oil throughput capacity utilization was 93 percent in 2012 compared with 92 percent in 2011 we are forecasting 2013 utilization to remain in the low 90percent range 

as part of our normal process we made a scheduled us federal income tax payment in the fourth quarter of 2012 using the irs safe harbor method for estimated 2012 taxable income we determined that a portion of that payment is refundable as an overpayment of estimated tax and we intend to file for a quick refund with the irs in the first quarter of 2013 we expect this refund to benefit cash from operations in the first quarter of 2013 by approximately 350 million 

our operating cash flows are also impacted by distribution decisions made by our equity affiliates including wrb dcp midstream and cpchem over the three years ended december 31 2012  we received distributions of  1932 million  from wrb  884 million  from dcp midstream and  1380 million  from cpchem we cannot control the amount of future distributions from equity affiliates therefore future distributions by these and other equity affiliates are not assured 

asset sales 

proceeds from asset sales in 2012  were  286 million  compared with  2627 million  in 2011  and  662 million  in 2010  the 2012 proceeds from asset sales included the sale of our refinery and associated terminal and pipeline assets located in trainer pennsylvania as well as the sale of our riverhead terminal located in riverhead new york the 2011 proceeds from asset sales included the sale of our ownership interests in colonial pipeline company and seaway crude pipeline company as well as the wilhelmshaven refinery and seaway products pipeline company the 2010 proceeds included the sale of our 50 percent interest in cfj properties 

credit facilities 

in february 2012 we entered into a fiveyear revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions under the terms of the revolving credit agreement we have a borrowing capacity of up to 40 billion  we have not borrowed under this facility however as of december 31 2012 51 million  in letters of credit had been issued that were supported by this facility 

the revolving credit agreement contains covenants that we consider usual and customary for an agreement of this type for comparable commercial borrowers including a maximum consolidated net debttocapitalization ratio of 60 percent the agreement has customary events of default such as nonpayment of principal when due nonpayment of interest fees or other amounts violation of covenants crosspayment default and crossacceleration in each case to indebtedness in excess of a threshold amount and a change of control 

borrowings under the credit agreement will incur interest at the london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin based on the credit rating of our senior unsecured longterm debt as determined from time to time by standard  poors ratings services sp and moodys investors service moodys the revolving credit agreement also provides for customary fees including administrative agent fees and commitment fees 

during april 2012 a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary entered into a trade receivables securitization facility the facility has a term of three years and an aggregate capacity of 12 billion  as of december 31 2012 we had not borrowed under the facility but we had obtained 166 million  in letters of credit under the facility that were collateralized by 166 million  of the trade receivables held by the subsidiary

debt financings 

during march 2012 we issued through a private placement 58 billion of debt consisting of 

 

the notes are guaranteed by phillips 66 company a wholly owned subsidiary in connection with the private placement we and phillips 66 company entered into a registration rights agreement with the initial purchasers of the notes pursuant to which we agreed for the benefit of the holders of the notes to use our commercially reasonable efforts to file with the sec and cause to be effective a registration statement with respect to a registered offer to exchange each series of notes for new notes that are guaranteed by phillips 66 company with terms substantially identical in all material respects to such series of notes 

on november 5 2012 we filed a registration statement on form s4 with the sec in accordance with the registration rights agreement outlining our offer to exchange our 58 billion senior notes for substantially identical notes without transfer restrictions the registration statement was declared effective on november 15 2012 and the exchange offer for the notes was completed in january 2013 with 999 percent  participation 

during april 2012 approximately 185 million of previously existing debt was retired also during april we closed on 20 billion of new debt in the form of a threeyear amortizing term loan the term loan bears interest at a variable rate based on referenced rates plus a margin dependent upon the credit rating of our senior unsecured longterm debt as determined from time to time by sp and moodys as of december 31 2012 the interest rate was 147 percent in december 2012 we made a 10 billion prepayment on the term loan 

our senior unsecured longterm debt has been rated investment grade by sp and moodys we do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default and thereby impact our access to liquidity in the event of a downgrade of our credit rating if our credit rating deteriorated to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market we would expect to be able to access funds under our 52 billion  in liquidity facilities mentioned above 

shelf registration 

we have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the sec under which we as a wellknown seasoned issuer have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as part of our normal ongoing business operations we enter into agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities which share costs and apportion risks among the parties as governed by the agreements in april 2012 in connection with the separation we entered into an agreement to guarantee 100 percent of certain outstanding debt obligations of mslp at december 31 2012 the aggregate principal amount of mslp debt guaranteed by us was 233 million

2013 budget 

our 2013 planned capital budget is 19 billion this excludes our portion of planned capital spending by dcp midstream cpchem and wrb totaling 18 billion which is not expected to require cash outlays by us our 2013 budgeted consolidated capital expenditures and investments represent an 11 percent  increase over our 2012 consolidated capital spending of  17 billion  rm is expected to spend 14 billion  in 2013 primarily directed toward reliability maintenance safety and environmental projects as well as targeted growth and optimization spending approximately 10 billion  of this amount is attributable to projects in the united states the midstream budget includes additional investment related to our onethird direct interest in the sand hills and southern hills pipelines within corporate and other we expect to invest approximately 02 billion in 2013 related to information technology facilities and research and development 

contingencies 

a number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims have been made against us in connection with matters that arise in the ordinary course of business we also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement storage disposal or release of certain chemical mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites we regularly assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies in the case of all known contingencies other than those related to income taxes we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable if a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount then the minimum of the range is accrued we do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or thirdparty recoveries if applicable we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other thirdparty recoveries in the case of incometaxrelated contingencies we use a cumulative probabilityweighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain 

based on currently available information we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements as we learn new facts concerning contingencies we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include contingent liabilities recorded for environmental remediation tax and legal matters estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes

legal and tax matters 

our legal organization applies its knowledge experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases this process also enables us to track those cases that have been scheduled for trial andor mediation based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals or establishment of new accruals are required see note 21—income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about incometaxrelated contingencies 

environmental 

we are subject to the same numerous international federal state and local environmental laws and regulations as other companies in our industry the most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include among others the 

  

 these laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and in the case of discharges to water establish water quality limits they also in most cases require permits in association with new or modified operations these permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process which can be expensive and time consuming in addition there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency’s processing of the application many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant 

many states and foreign countries where we operate also have or are developing similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities while similar in some cases these regulations may impose additional or more stringent requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders 

the ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards such as air emission standards water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations continue to evolve however environmental laws and regulations including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the united states and in other countries in which we operate notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the united states 

an example in the fuels area is the energy policy act of 2005 which imposed obligations to provide increasing volumes of renewable fuels in transportation motor fuels through 2012 these obligations were changed with the enactment of the energy independence and security act of 2007 eisa the 2007 law requires fuel producers and importers to provide additional renewable fuels for transportation motor fuels and stipulates a mix of various types to be included through 2022 we have met the increasingly stringent requirements to date while establishing implementation operating and capital strategies along with advanced technology development to address projected future requirements it is uncertain how various future requirements contained in eisa and the regulations promulgated thereunder may be implemented and what their full impact may be on our operations also we may experience a decrease in demand for refined petroleum products due to the regulatory program as currently promulgated 

index to financial statements 

we also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations such laws and regulations include cercla and rcra and their state equivalents remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility arising from petroleum releases from underground storage tanks located at numerous past and present owned andor operated petroleummarketing outlets throughout the united states federal and state laws require contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards in addition to other cleanup standards many states have adopted cleanup criteria for methyl tertiarybutyl ether mtbe for both soil and groundwater 

at rcrapermitted facilities we are required to assess environmental conditions if conditions warrant we may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations in contrast to cercla which is often referred to as “superfund” the cost of corrective action activities under rcra corrective action programs typically is borne solely by us we anticipate increased expenditures for rcra remediation activities may be required but such annual expenditures for the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures we have experienced over the past few years longerterm expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly 

we occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the us environmental protection agency epa and state environmental agencies alleging we are a potentially responsible party under cercla or an equivalent state statute on occasion we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties these requests notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations as of december 31 2011  we reported we had been notified of potential liability under cercla and comparable state laws at 61 sites around the united states at december 31 2012  we had been notified of 1 new site settled 3 sites and 11 sites were resolved and closed leaving 48 sites with potential liability 

for most superfund sites our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties is relatively low although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations and where they have not or where potentially responsible parties could not be located our share of liability has not increased materially many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the epa or the state agencies concerned prior to actual cleanup those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation in some instances we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain epa or equivalent state agency approval of a remediation plan there are relatively few sites where we are a major participant and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all cercla sites in the aggregate is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition 

expensed environmental costs were 645 million in 2012  and are expected to be approximately 650 million per year in 2013  and 2014  capitalized environmental costs were 264 million in 2012  and are expected to be approximately 320 million per year in 2013  and 2014  this amount does not include capital expenditures made for another purpose that have an indirect benefit on environmental compliance 

accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted except those assumed in a purchase business combination which we do record on a discounted basis 

many of these liabilities result from cercla rcra and similar state laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct or once conducted operations or at sites where our generated waste was disposed we also have accrued for a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation but which are not currently the subject of cercla rcra or state enforcement activities if applicable we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other thirdparty recoveries in the future we may incur significant costs under both cercla and rcra remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site depending on the mix of unique site characteristics evolving remediation technologies diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties therefore it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs 

at december 31 2012  our balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of 530 million compared with 542 million at december 31 2011  and 554 million at december 31 2010  we expect to incur a substantial amount of these expenditures within the next 30 years 

notwithstanding any of the foregoing and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in our operations and products and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities 

index to financial statements 

will not be incurred however we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations 

the epa’s renewable fuel standard rfs program was implemented in accordance with the energy policy act of 2005 and the eisa the rfs program sets annual quotas for the percentage of biofuels such as ethanol that must be blended into motor fuels consumed in the united states a renewable identification number rin represents a serial number assigned to each gallon of biofuel produced or imported into the united states as a producer of petroleumbased motor fuels we are obligated to blend biofuels into the products we produce at a rate that is at least equal to the epa’s quota and to the extent we do not we must purchase rins in the open market to satisfy our obligation under the rfs program the market for rins has been the subject of fraudulent activity and we have identified that we have unknowingly purchased rins in the past that were invalid due to fraudulent activity although costs to replace fraudulently marketed rins that have been determined to be invalid have not been material through december 31 2012  it is reasonably possible that some additional rins that we have previously purchased may also be determined to be invalid should that occur we could incur additional replacement charges although the cost for replacing any additional fraudulently marketed rins is not reasonably estimable at this time we could have a possible exposure of approximately 150 million before tax it could take several years for this possible exposure to reach ultimate resolution therefore we would not expect to incur the full financial impact of additional fraudulent rin replacement costs in any single interim or annual period 

climate change 

there has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state national and international laws focusing on greenhouse gas ghg reduction these proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future laws in this field continue to evolve and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation such laws if enacted could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include 

  

 in the eu we have assets that are subject to the ets the first phase of the ets was completed at the end of 2007 and phase ii ran from 2008 through 2012 phase iii will run from 2013 through 2020 and there will likely be a significant increase in auctioning levels including 100 percent auctioning to the power sector in the uk and across most of the eu we are actively engaged to minimize any financial impact from the trading scheme 

in the united states some additional form of regulation may be forthcoming in the future at the federal or state levels with respect to ghg emissions such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes the restriction of output investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances we are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations 

compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a ghg emission trading scheme or ghg reduction policies could significantly increase our costs reduce demand for fossil energy derived products impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources an example of one such program is californias cap and trade program which was promulgated pursuant to the states global warming solutions act the program currently is limited to certain stationary sources which include our refineries in 

index to financial statements 

california but beginning in 2015 will expand to include emissions from transportation fuels distributed in california we expect inclusion of transportation fuels in californias cap and trade program as currently promulgated would increase our cap and trade program compliance costs the ultimate impact on our financial performance either positive or negative from this and similar programs will depend on a number of factors including but not limited to 

  

 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses see note 2—accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for descriptions of our major accounting policies certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions or if different assumptions had been used the following discussions of critical accounting estimates along with the discussion of contingencies in this report address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions could be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change 

impairments 

longlived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows is expected to be generated by an asset group if upon review the sum of the undiscounted pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets—generally at an entire refinery complex level because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for longlived assets the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants or based on a multiple of operating cash flows validated with historical market transactions of similar assets where possible the expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future volumes commodity prices operating costs margins discount rates and capital project decisions considering all available information at the date of review 

investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence of a loss in value such evidence of a loss in value might include our inability to recover the carrying amount the lack of sustained earnings capacity which would justify the current investment amount or a current fair value less than the investment’s carrying amount when it is determined such a loss in value is other than temporary an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the investment’s carrying value and its estimated fair value when determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline the investee’s financial condition and nearterm prospects and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value of the investment when quoted market prices are not available the fair value is usually based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee if appropriate differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period

asset retirement obligations 

under various contracts permits and regulations we have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land at the end of operations at certain operational sites our largest asset removal obligations involve asbestos abatement at refineries estimating the future asset removal costs necessary for this accounting calculation is difficult most of these removal obligations are many years or decades in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs asset removal technologies and costs regulatory and other compliance considerations expenditure timing and other inputs into valuation of the obligation including discount and inflation rates are also subject to change 

environmental costs 

in addition to asset retirement obligations discussed above under the above or similar contracts permits and regulations we have certain obligations to complete environmentalrelated projects these projects are primarily related to cleanup at domestic refineries underground storage sites and nonoperated sites future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties 

intangible assets and goodwill 

at december 31 2012 we had 701 million  of intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives and thus they are not amortized this judgmental assessment of an indefinite useful life must be continuously evaluated in the future if due to changes in facts and circumstances management determines these intangible assets have finite useful lives amortization will commence at that time on a prospective basis as long as these intangible assets are judged to have indefinite lives they will be subject to annual lowerofcostorfair value tests that require management’s judgment of the estimated fair value of these intangible assets 

at december 31 2012 we had 33 billion  of goodwill recorded in conjunction with past business combinations under the accounting rules for goodwill this intangible asset is not amortized instead goodwill is subject to at least annual reviews for impairment at a reporting unit level the reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed a reporting unit is an operating segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment we determined we had one reporting unit for purposes of assigning goodwill and testing for impairment—the rm operating segment we have concluded the refining and marketing components within the rm segment are economically similar enough to be aggregated into one reporting unit 

if we later reorganize our businesses or management structure so that our operating segments change or such that the components within our reporting unit are no longer economically similar the reporting units would be revised and goodwill would be reassigned using a relative fair value approach goodwill impairment testing at a lower reporting unit level could result in the recognition of impairment that would not otherwise be recognized at the current level in addition the sale or disposition of a portion of our reporting unit will be allocated a portion of the reporting unit’s goodwill based on relative fair values which will adjust the amount of gain or loss on the sale or disposition 

because quoted market prices for our reporting unit are not available management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of this reporting unit for purposes of performing the goodwill impairment test management uses all available information to make this fair value determination including the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the assets and observed market multiples of operating cash flows and net income in addition if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the book value including the goodwill further management judgment must be applied in determining the fair values of individual assets and liabilities for purposes of the hypothetical purchase price allocation at yearend 2012 the estimated fair value of our rm operating segment reporting unit was approximately 30 percent higher than recorded net book values including goodwill of the reporting unit however a lower fair value estimate in the future could result in an impairment our common stock price and associated total company market capitalization are also considered in the determination of reporting unit fair value a prolonged or significant decline in our stock price could provide evidence of a need to record a material impairment of goodwill

tax assets and liabilities 

our operations are subject to various taxes including federal state and foreign income taxes and transactional taxes such as excise salesuse property and payroll taxes we record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations the recording of tax liabilities may require significant judgment and estimates we recognize the financial statement effects of an income tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority a contingent liability related to a transactional tax claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and estimable actual incurred tax liabilities can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons including different interpretations of tax laws and regulations and different assessments of the amount of tax due 

in determining our income tax provision we must assess the likelihood our deferred tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income valuation allowances reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized judgment is required in estimating the amount of valuation allowance if any that should be recorded against our deferred tax assets based on our historical taxable income our expectations for the future and available taxplanning strategies we expect the net deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as reductions to future taxable income if our actual results of operations differ from such estimates or our estimates of future taxable income change the valuation allowance may need to be revised 

new tax laws and regulations as well as changes to existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being proposed or promulgated the implementation of future legislative and regulatory tax initiatives could result in increased tax liabilities that cannot be predicted at this time 

projected benefit obligations 

determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement the actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events including estimated retirement dates salary levels at retirement mortality rates lumpsum election rates rates of return on plan assets future health care costtrend rates and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees due to the specialized nature of these calculations we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects ultimately we will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions a 1 percent decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by an estimated 60 million while a 1 percent decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by an estimated 20 million  i n determining the discount rate we use yields on highquality fixed income investments with payments matched to the estimated distributions of benefits from our plans 

outlook 

in december 2012 we announced our intention to contribute a portion of our transportation and logistics assets to form a master limited partnership mlp we are evaluating assets for contribution to the mlp including certain petroleum product and crude oil pipelines and terminals a registration statement for an initial public offering ipo is expected to be filed with the sec in the second quarter of 2013 subject to market conditions and final approval by our board of directors we anticipate selling a minority interest in the mlp in an ipo in the second half of 2013

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial instrument market risk 

we and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose our cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates we may use financial and commoditybased derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of crude oil and related products natural gas and electric power fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates or to capture market opportunities 

our use of derivative instruments is governed by an “authority limitations” document approved by our board of directors that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient market liquidity for comparable valuations the authority limitations document also establishes the value at risk var limits for us and compliance with these limits is monitored daily our chief financial officer monitors risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates our executive vice president over the commercial organization monitors commodity price risk the commercial organization manages our commercial marketing optimizes our commodity flows and positions and monitors related risks of our businesses 

commodity price risk 

we sell into or receive supply from the worldwide crude oil refined products natural gas ngl and electric power markets and are exposed to fluctuations in the prices for these commodities 

these fluctuations can affect our revenues and purchases as well as the cost of operating investing and financing activities generally our policy is to remain exposed to the market prices of commodities 

our commercial organization uses futures forwards swaps and options in various markets to optimize the value of our supply chain which may move our risk profile away from market average prices to accomplish the following objectives 

  

 

we use a var model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments held or issued including commodity purchase and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at december 31 2012 as derivative instruments using monte carlo simulation a 95 percent confidence level and a oneday holding period the var for those instruments issued or held for trading purposes at december 31 2012 and 2011 was immaterial to our cash flows and net income 

the var for instruments held for purposes other than trading at december 31 2012 and 2011 was also immaterial to our cash flows and net income 

interest rate risk 

the following table provides information about our debt instruments that are sensitive to changes in us interest rates the table presents principal cash flows and related weightedaverage interest rates by expected maturity dates weightedaverage variable rates are based on effective rates at the reporting date the carrying amount of our floatingrate debt approximates its fair value the fair value of the fixedrate financial instruments is estimated based on quoted market prices
