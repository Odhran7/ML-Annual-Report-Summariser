industry overview 

the retail pharmacy industry across the globe is highly competitive and dynamic and has experienced consolidation and an evolving competitive landscape in recent years prescription drugs play a significant role in healthcare and constitute a first line of treatment for many medical conditions the company believes the longterm outlook for prescription drug utilization is strong due in part to aging populations increases in the availability of generic drugs the continued development of innovative drugs that improve quality of life and control healthcare costs and increases in the number of persons with insurance coverage for prescription drugs including in the us “baby boomers” increasingly becoming eligible for the federally funded medicare part d prescription program pharmaceutical wholesalers act as a vital link between drug manufacturers pharmacies and healthcare providers in supplying pharmaceuticals to patients 

the retail pharmacy industry across the globe relies significantly on private and governmental thirdparty payers many private organizations throughout the healthcare industry including pharmacy benefit management “pbm” companies and health insurance companies have consolidated in recent years to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater bargaining power thirdparty payers including the medicare part d plans and the statesponsored medicaid and related managed care medicaid agencies in the us can change eligibility requirements or reduce certain reimbursement rates in addition in many european countries the government provides or subsidizes healthcare to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices patient eligibility and reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored healthcare system changes in law or regulation also can impact reimbursement rates and terms for example the patient protection and affordable care act the “aca” was enacted to help control federal healthcare spending including for prescription drugs in the us these changes generally are expected to reduce medicaid reimbursements in the us state medicaid programs are also expected to continue to seek reductions in reimbursements in addition on august 16 2022 president biden signed into law the inflation reduction act of 2022 which among other things includes policies that are designed to have a direct impact on drug prices and reduce drug spending by the federal government which shall take effect in 2023 for example the inflation reduction act requires drug manufacturers to pay rebates to medicare if they increase prices faster than inflation for drugs used by medicare beneficiaries the mechanics of the rebate calculation would mimic those of the medicaid rebate but the expansion of inflationbased rebates may further complicate pricing strategies particularly as to the launch of our new products when thirdparty payers or governmental authorities take actions that restrict eligibility or reduce prices or reimbursement rates sales and margins in the retail pharmacy industry could be reduced which would adversely affect industry profitability in some cases these possible adverse effects may be partially or entirely offset by controlling inventory costs and other expenses dispensing more higher margin generics finding new revenue streams through pharmacy services or other offerings andor dispensing a greater volume of prescriptions 

these industry dynamics and challenges are continuous and have intensified in recent years since the completion of the strategic combination of walgreens and alliance boots in december 2014 the company has had a continuous focus on operational efficiencies and cost reduction 



generic prescription drugs have continued to help lower overall costs for customers and thirdparty payers the company expects the utilization of generic pharmaceuticals to continue to increase in general in the us generic versions of drugs generate lower sales dollars per prescription but higher gross profit dollars as compared with patentprotected brand name drugs the impact on retail pharmacy gross profit dollars can be significant in the first several months after a generic version of a drug is first allowed to compete with the branded version which is generally referred to as a “generic conversion” in any given year the number of major brand name drugs that undergo a conversion from branded to generic status can vary and the timing of generic conversions can be difficult to predict which can have a significant impact on retail pharmacy sales and gross profit dollars in general in the us the specialty prescription business is also growing and generates higher sales dollars per prescription but lower gross margin as compared to generic prescription drugs 

the company expects that market demand government regulation thirdparty reimbursement policies government contracting requirements and other pressures will continue to cause the industries in which the company competes to evolve pharmacists are on the frontlines of the healthcare delivery system and the company believes rising healthcare costs and the limited access to primary care physicians present opportunities for pharmacists and retail pharmacies to play an even greater role in driving positive outcomes for patients and payers through expanded service offerings 

segments 

the companys operations are conducted through three reportable segments 

• us retail pharmacy 

• international and

the segment provides customers with convenient omnichannel access to consumer goods and services including own branded general merchandise such as nice finest nutrition no7 and soap  glory as well as pharmacy and health and wellness services in communities across the us integrated with the company’s ecommerce platform the walgreens mobile application allows customers to refill prescriptions through scan technology receive notifications when a refill is due and choose their delivery option which includes instore pick up drivethrough or delivery to their home 

in fiscal 2021 we launched mywalgreens replacing the former balanced rewards customer loyalty program to provide a new interface for customers to access the enhanced and growing walgreens digital offering the new program simplifies how customers accumulate and use rewards points have been replaced by walgreens cash reflecting the actual value of the reward and allowing the cash benefit to be applied as the customer chooses not just to future transactions at walgreens but even in support of their favorite charity or community cause the number of mywalgreens members continues to grow and as of august 31 2022 totaled approximately 102 million

the components of the segment’s sales are pharmacy the sale of prescription drugs and provision of pharmacyrelated services and retail the sale of healthcare and retail products including nonprescription drugs health and wellness beauty and personal care and consumables and general merchandise the segment’s sales are subject to the influence of seasonality particularly the cough cold and flu seasons and winter holiday this seasonality also can affect the segment’s proportion of sales between retail and pharmacy during certain periods the components of the segment’s fiscal year sales were as follows 

the company filled 8196 million prescriptions including vaccinations in the segment in fiscal 2022 adjusted to 30day equivalents prescriptions filled were 12 billion in fiscal 2022 the company fills prescriptions under medicare medicaid and other publicly financed or sponsored health benefit and prescription drug plans and programs including the federal 340b drug pricing program sales where reimbursement is received from managed care organizations governmental agencies pbm companies and private insurance were approximately 97 of the segment’s fiscal 2022 pharmacy sales 

the company fills prescriptions for many state medicaid public assistance programs sales from all such medicaid plans were approximately 5 of the segment’s fiscal 2022 sales sales from medicare part d plans were approximately 22 of the segment’s fiscal 2022 sales 

the companys mywalgreens credit card program features the mywalgreens mastercard and the mywalgreens credit card these cards are the first ever of their kind to reward more personalized wellbeing choices and offer industryleading rewards at walgreens locations walgreenscom duane reade stores via the walgreens mobile app and wherever mastercard is accepted 

amerisourcebergen supplies and distributes a significant amount of generic and branded pharmaceutical products to the segment’s pharmacies the company purchases its nonpharmaceutical merchandise from numerous manufacturers and wholesalers 

the segment’s sales gross profit margin and gross profit are impacted by among other things both the percentage of prescriptions filled that are generic and the rate at which new generic drugs are introduced to the market because any number of factors outside of the company’s control can affect timing for a generic conversion the company faces substantial uncertainty in predicting when such conversions will occur and what effect they will have on particular future periods 



the current environment of the company’s pharmacy business also includes ongoing reimbursement pressure a shift in pharmacy mix towards 90day at retail one prescription that is the equivalent of three 30day prescriptions an increased volume of medicare part d prescriptions and increased consumer use of prescription discount cards further consolidation among generic manufacturers coupled with changes in the number of major brand name drugs anticipated to undergo a conversion from branded to generic status may also result in gross margin pressures within the industry 

the company continuously faces reimbursement pressure from pbm companies government health maintenance organizations managed care organizations and other commercial thirdparty payers agreements with these payers are regularly subject to expiration termination or renegotiation in addition plan changes with rate adjustments often occur in january and the company’s reimbursement arrangements may provide for rate adjustments at prescribed intervals during their term the company experienced lower reimbursement rates in fiscal 2022 as compared to the same period in the prior year the company expects these pressures to continue 

the company has also worked to develop and expand its relationships with commercial thirdparty payers to enable new andor improved market access via participation in pharmacy provider networks they offer the prescription volume impact of new agreements and relationships typically is incremental over time 

the company’s 90day at retail prescription drug offering is typically at a lower margin than comparable 30day prescriptions but provides the company with the opportunity to increase business with patients with chronic prescription needs while offering increased convenience helping facilitate improved prescription adherence and resulting in a lower cost to fill the 90day prescription similarly the specialty prescription business which generates higher sales dollars per prescription may result in gross margin pressures within the industry as compared to generic prescription drugs the segment’s performance is also impacted by the current environment including the uncertainty as a result of covid19 for more information see risk factors in item 1a

risks relating to our business 

global health developments and economic uncertainty resulting from covid19 have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial position 

covid19 has severely impacted and may continue to severely impact the economies of the us the uk and other countries around the world as a result governmental authorities imposed a variety of restrictions on people and businesses and public health authorities offered regular guidance on health and safety all of which had an adverse impact on footfall in our stores general economic activity and consumer behavior and spending patterns covid19 has created significant volatility uncertainty and economic disruption in every region in which we operate all of which have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

covid19 and related measures have impacted and may continue to impact many aspects of our business financial condition and results of operations in a number of ways including but not limited to our growth product costs supply chain disruptions and the potential for inventory spoilage labor shortages and costs operating costs logistics constraints customer demand for our products and industry demand generally consumer spending our liquidity the price of our securities our ability to access capital markets and the global economy and financial markets generally our stores are open and operational however any future illness or absence of a substantial number of employees could require that we temporarily close one or more of our stores we have experienced and may experience in the future disruptions in store and distribution centers operations including the temporary closure of certain stores 

we have incurred and continue to incur additional costs to protect the health and wellbeing and meet the needs of our customers and team members these measures may not be sufficient to prevent the spread of covid19 among our customers and employees illness absenteeism or other workforce disruptions could negatively affect our business operations further the shift to a remote working environment and other policies has and will continue to have impacts on our business including increased costs related to information technology infrastructure and the ability of our business and that of our suppliers to work with the same productivity the increase in remote work arrangements has increased certain operational risks including but not limited to cybersecurity risks and could adversely affect our ability to manage our business 

the extent of the impact of covid19 on our future operational and financial performance is currently uncertain and will depend on many factors outside our control including without limitation the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines the imposition of public safety measures and the impact of covid19 on the global economy potential negative impacts of these external factors include but are not limited to material adverse effects on demand for our products and services our supply chain and sales and distribution channels our ability to execute strategic plans impairments and our profitability and cost structure to the extent covid19 adversely affects our business results of operations and financial condition it may also have the effect of exacerbating the other risks discussed in this “risk factors” section 



reductions in thirdparty reimbursement levels from private or governmental agency plans and potential changes in industry pricing benchmarks for prescription drugs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

the substantial majority of the prescriptions we fill are reimbursed by thirdparty payers including private and governmental agency payers the continued efforts of health maintenance organizations managed care organizations pbm companies governmental agencies and other thirdparty payers to reduce prescription drug costs and pharmacy reimbursement rates as well as litigation and other legal proceedings relating to how drugs are priced may adversely impact our results of operations in the us plan changes with rate adjustments often occur in january and our reimbursement arrangements may provide for rate adjustments at prescribed intervals during their term in addition the timing and amount of periodic contractual reconciliations payments can vary significantly and may not follow a predictable path further in an environment where some pbm clients utilize narrow or restricted pharmacy provider networks some of these entities may offer pricing terms that we may not be willing to accept or otherwise restrict our participation in their networks of pharmacy providers 

in addition many payers in the us are increasingly considering new metrics as the basis for reimbursement rates it is possible that the pharmaceutical industry or regulators may evaluate andor develop an alternative pricing reference to replace average wholesale price which is the pricing reference used for many of our contracts in addition many state medicaid feeforservice programs have established pharmacy network payments on the basis of actual acquisition cost which could have an impact on reimbursement practices in other commercial and governmental arrangements future changes to the pricing benchmarks used to establish pharmaceutical pricing including changes in the basis for calculating reimbursement by thirdparty payers could adversely affect us 

a shift in pharmacy mix toward lower margin plans products and programs could adversely affect our results of operations 

our us retail pharmacy segment seeks to grow prescription volume while operating in a marketplace with continuous reimbursement pressure a shift in the mix of pharmacy prescription volume towards programs offering lower reimbursement rates could adversely affect our results of operations for example our us retail pharmacy segment has experienced a shift in pharmacy mix towards 90day at retail in recent years and more recently during covid19 and specialty pharmacy represents a significant and growing proportion of prescription drug spending in the us and a larger proportion of our revenues our 90day at retail offering for patients with chronic prescription needs typically is at a lower margin than comparable 30day prescriptions and specialty pharmacy sales are generally also lower margin our us retail pharmacy segment also has experienced a shift in pharmacy mix towards medicare part d prescriptions in recent years and that trend may continue preferred medicare part d networks have increased in number in recent years however we do not participate in all such networks we have accepted market competitive reimbursement rates in order to secure preferred relationships with medicare part d plans serving senior patients with significant pharmacy needs we also have worked to develop and expand our relationships with commercial thirdparty payers to enable new andor improved market access via participation in the pharmacy provider networks they offer if we are not able to generate additional prescription volume and other business from patients participating in these programs that is sufficient to offset the impact of lower reimbursement or if the degree or terms of our participation in such preferred networks declines from current levels in future years our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we derive a significant portion of our sales in the us retail pharmacy segment from prescription drug sales reimbursed by a limited number of pharmacy benefit management companies 

we derive a significant portion of our sales in the us retail pharmacy segment from prescription drug sales reimbursed through prescription drug plans administered by a limited number of pbm companies pbm companies typically administer multiple prescription drug plans that expire at various times and provide for varying reimbursement rates and often limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list known as a formulary which might not include all of the approved drugs for a particular indication changes in pricing and other terms of our contracts with pbm companies can significantly impact our results of operations there can be no assurance that we will continue to participate in any particular pbm company’s pharmacy provider network in any particular future time period or on terms reasonably acceptable to us if our participation in the pharmacy provider network for a prescription drug plan administered by one or more of the large pbm companies is restricted or terminated we expect that our sales would be adversely affected at least in the shortterm if we are unable to replace any such lost sales either through an increase in other sales or through a resumption of participation in those plans our operating results could be materially and adversely affected if we exit a pharmacy provider network and later resume participation there can be no assurance that we will achieve any particular level of business on any particular pace or that all clients of the pbm company will choose to include us again in the pharmacy network for their plans initially or at all in addition in such circumstances we may incur increased marketing and other costs in connection with initiatives to regain former patients and attract new patients covered by such plans 



we could be adversely affected by a decrease in the introduction of new brand name and generic prescription drugs as well as increases in the cost to procure prescription drugs 

the profitability of our pharmacy businesses depends upon the utilization of prescription drugs utilization trends are affected by among other factors the introduction of new and successful prescription drugs as well as lowerpriced generic alternatives to existing brand name drugs inflation in the price of drugs also can adversely affect utilization particularly given the increased prevalence of highdeductible health insurance plans and related plan design changes new brand name drugs can result in increased drug utilization and associated sales while the introduction of lower priced generic alternatives typically results in relatively lower sales but relatively higher gross profit margins accordingly a decrease in the number or magnitude of significant new brand name drugs or generics successfully introduced delays in their introduction or a decrease in the utilization of previously introduced prescription drugs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

in addition if we experience an increase in the amounts we pay to procure pharmaceutical drugs including generic drugs our gross profit margins would be adversely affected to the extent we are not able to offset such cost increases any failure to fully offset any such increased prices and costs or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations also any future changes in drug prices could be significantly different than our expectations 

consolidation and strategic alliances in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business operations competitive positioning financial condition and results of operations 

many organizations in the healthcare industry including pbm companies have consolidated in recent years to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater bargaining power which has resulted in greater pricing pressures if this consolidation trend continues it could give the resulting enterprises even greater bargaining power which may lead to further pressure on the prices for our products and services if these pressures result in reductions in our prices our businesses would become less profitable unless we are able to achieve corresponding reductions in costs or develop profitable new revenue streams 

our business results depend on our ability to successfully manage ongoing organizational change and business transformation and achieve cost savings and operating efficiency initiatives 

our board of directors approved the plans to increase the transformational cost management program described in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii item 7 as part of an initiative to reduce costs and increase operating efficiencies there can be no assurance that we will realize in full or in part the anticipated benefits of these programs our financial goals assume a level of productivity improvement including those reflected in the transformational cost management program and other business optimization initiatives if we are unable to implement the programs or deliver these expected productivity improvements while continuing to invest in business growth or if the volume and nature of change overwhelms available resources our business operations financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted 

changes in economic conditions could adversely affect consumer buying practices 

our performance has been and may continue to be adversely impacted by changes in global national regional or local economic conditions and consumer confidence these conditions can also adversely affect our key vendors and customers external factors that affect consumer confidence and over which we exercise no influence include unemployment rates inflation levels of personal disposable income levels of taxes and interest and global national regional or local economic conditions health epidemics or pandemics such as covid19 as well as looting vandalism acts of war or terrorism changes in economic conditions and consumer confidence could adversely affect consumer preferences purchasing power and spending patterns which could lead to a decrease in overall consumer spending as well as in prescription drug and health services utilization and which could be exacerbated by the increasing prevalence of highdeductible health insurance plans and related plan design changes in addition to general levels of inflation that we have experienced we are also subject to risk of specific inflationary pressures on product prices due to for example the continuing impacts of covid19 related global supply chain disruptions and the uncertain economic and geopolitical environment if inflation continues to increase we may not be able to adjust prices sufficiently to offset the effect without negatively impacting consumer demand or our gross margin furthermore reduced or flat consumer spending may drive us and our competitors to offer additional products at promotional prices all of these factors could materially and adversely impact our business operations financial condition and results of operations 



the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and constantly evolving and changes in market dynamics could adversely impact us 

the level of competition in the retail pharmacy healthcare services and pharmaceutical wholesale industries is high changes in market dynamics or actions of competitors or manufacturers including industry consolidation and the emergence of new competitors and strategic alliances could materially and adversely impact us disruptive innovation or the perception of potentially disruptive innovation by existing or new competitors could alter the competitive landscape in the future and require us to accurately identify and assess such changes and if required make timely and effective changes to our strategies and business model to compete effectively all of our businesses face intense competition from multiple existing and new businesses some of which are aggressively expanding in markets we serve we continue to develop our offerings to respond to market dynamics however if our customers are not receptive to these changes if we are unable to expand successful programs in a timely manner or we otherwise do not effectively respond to changes in market dynamics our businesses and financial performance could be materially and adversely affected 

specialty pharmacy represents a significant and growing proportion of prescription drug spending in the us a significant portion of which is dispensed outside of traditional retail pharmacies because our specialty pharmacy business focuses on complex and highcost medications many of which are made available by manufacturers to a limited number of pharmacies socalled limited distribution drugs that serve a relatively limited universe of patients the future growth of this business depends to a significant extent upon expanding our ability to access key drugs and successfully penetrate key treatment categories accordingly it is important that we and our affiliates compete effectively in this evolving and highly competitive market or our business operations financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected to better serve this evolving market the company wholly owns and operates alliancerx walgreens certain clients of alliancerx walgreens were and are not obligated to contract through alliancerx walgreens and have in the past and may in the future enter into specialty pharmacy and other agreements without involving alliancerx walgreens certain clients have chosen not to renew their contracts through alliancerx walgreens which impacts gross sales if alliancerx walgreens is not able to compete effectively in this evolving and highly competitive market and successfully adapt to changing market conditions our business operations financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

if we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant omnichannel experience for our customers our businesses and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

the portion of total consumer expenditures with retailers occurring online and through mobile applications has continued to increase and has accelerated significantly during covid19 the pace of this increase could further accelerate in the future our business has evolved from an instore experience to interaction with customers across numerous channels including instore online mobile and social media among others omnichannel and differentiated retail models are rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing customer expectations and new developments by our competitors we must compete by offering a consistent and convenient shopping experience for our customers regardless of the ultimate sales channel and by investing in providing and maintaining digital tools for our customers if we are unable to make improve or develop relevant customerfacing technology in a timely manner that keeps pace with technological developments and dynamic customer expectations our ability to compete and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected in addition if our online activities or our other customerfacing technology systems do not function as designed we may experience a loss of customer confidence data security breaches lost sales or be exposed to fraudulent purchases any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations reputation and results of operations 

if the merchandise and services that we offer fail to meet customer needs our sales may be adversely affected 

the success of our retail pharmacy businesses depends on our ability to offer a superior shopping experience engaging customer service and a quality assortment of available merchandise that differentiates us from other retailers including enhanced health and beauty product offerings we must identify obtain supplies of and offer to our customers attractive innovative and highquality merchandise on a continuous basis it is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand if we misjudge the demand for products and services we sell or our customers’ purchasing habits we may be faced with sales declines excess product inventories and missed opportunities for products and services we chose not to offer which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations 



our substantial international business operations subject us to a number of operating economic political regulatory and other international business risks 

our substantial international business operations are subject to a number of risks including without limitation compliance with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations potential difficulties in managing foreign operations mitigating credit risks in foreign markets enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems varying regional and geopolitical business conditions and demands tax and trade policies tariffs and other government regulations affecting trade between the us and other countries fluctuations in currency exchange rates the impact of recessions and economic slowdowns in economies outside the us and the instability of foreign economies governments and currencies and unexpected regulatory economic or political changes in foreign markets 

these factors can also adversely affect our payers vendors and customers in international markets which in turn can negatively impact our businesses we cannot assure you that one or more of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations results of operation and financial condition 

we may be unable to achieve our environmental social and governance goals 

we recognize the rising importance of environmental social and governance matters among our team members customers and certain shareholders and are committed to upholding a culture dedicated to corporate responsibility we have established certain goals that allow us to better communicate and align to our environmental social and governance strategy however these goals are subject to risks and uncertainties which are outside of our control and might prohibit us from meeting the goals further there is a risk that team members customers or certain shareholders might not be satisfied with our goals or strategy and efforts to meet the goals some of the risks that we are subject to include but are not limited to our ability to execute our operational strategy within the timeframe or costs projected the availability or cost of renewable energy materials goods andor services required and evolving regulations or requirements that change or limit our ability to set standards or gather information from our supplier partners or third party contractors failure to meet our goals could negatively impact public perception of our company with interested stakeholders 

environmental social and governance matters are also increasingly important to current and potential employees in order to retain and attract talent we know that it is critical that we clearly communicate our environmental social and governance strategy and a delay or inability to meet our goals on time could impact our reputation as a desirable place to work with increased interest from certain shareholders an inability to meet our goals could also have a negative impact on our stock price these impacts could make it more difficult for us to operate efficiently and effectively and could have a negative effect on our business operating results and financial conditions 

risks related to our operations 

disruption in our global supply chain could negatively impact our businesses 

the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors and any future disruption in our supply chain or inability to find qualified vendors and access products that meet requisite quality and safety standards in a timely and efficient manner could adversely impact our businesses the loss or disruption of such supply arrangements for any reason including for issues such as covid19 or other health epidemics or pandemics labor disputes loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites inability to procure sufficient raw materials quality control issues ethical sourcing issues a supplier’s financial distress natural disasters looting vandalism or acts of war such as the conflict in ukraine or terrorism trade sanctions or other external factors over which we have no control could interrupt product supply and if not effectively managed and remedied have a material adverse impact on our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

we outsource certain business processes to thirdparty vendors that subject us to risks including disruptions in business and increased costs 

we outsource certain business and administrative functions and rely on third parties to perform certain services on our behalf we rely on these third parties to meet our quality and performance requirements and to timely perform as expected if our continuing relationship with certain thirdparty providers is interrupted or if such thirdparty providers experience disruptions or do not perform as anticipated or we experience problems with any transition we may experience operational difficulties reputational harm and increased costs that could materially and adversely affect our business operations and results of operations 



we use a single wholesaler of branded and generic pharmaceutical drugs as our primary source of such products 

the company and amerisourcebergen are parties to various agreements and arrangements including a pharmaceutical distribution agreement between the company and amerisourcebergen pursuant to which we source branded and generic pharmaceutical products from amerisourcebergen in the us and an agreement which provides amerisourcebergen the ability to access generic pharmaceutical products through our global sourcing enterprise these agreements were amended in june 2021 in connection with the alliance healthcare sale pursuant to those amendments the us distribution agreement was extended through 2029 and the parties committed to pursue additional opportunities in sourcing and distribution the parties also agreed that alliance healthcare uk will remain the distribution partner of boots until 2031 as of the date of this report amerisourcebergen distributes substantially all of our branded and generic pharmaceutical products consequently our business may be adversely affected by any operational financial or regulatory difficulties that amerisourcebergen experiences including those resulting from covid19 for example if amerisourcebergen’s operations are seriously disrupted for any reason whether due to a natural disaster pandemic labor disruption regulatory action computer or operational systems or otherwise it could adversely affect our business and our results of operations 

our distribution agreement with amerisourcebergen is subject to early termination in certain circumstances and upon the expiration or termination of the agreement there can be no assurance that we or amerisourcebergen will be willing to renew the agreement or enter into a new agreement on terms favorable to us or at all if such expiration or termination occurred we believe that alternative sources of supply for most generic and brandname pharmaceuticals are readily available and that we could obtain and qualify alternative sources which may include selfdistribution in some cases for substantially all of the prescription drugs we sell on an acceptable basis such that the impact of any such expiration or termination would be temporary however there can be no assurance we would be able to engage alternative supply sources or implement selfdistribution processes on a timely basis or on terms favorable to us or effectively manage these transitions any of which could adversely affect our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

failure to retain and recruit or failure to manage succession of key personnel could have an adverse impact on our future performance 

our ability to attract engage develop and retain qualified and experienced employees at all levels including in executive and other key strategic positions is essential for us to meet our objectives competition among potential employers might result in increased salaries benefits or other employeerelated costs or in our failure to recruit and retain employees which could have a materially adverse impact on our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

additionally any failure to adequately plan for and manage succession of key management roles or the failure of key employees to successfully transition into new roles could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations while we have succession plans in place and employment arrangements with certain key executives these do not guarantee the services of these executives will continue to be available to us 

we may be unable to keep existing store locations or open new locations in desirable places on favorable terms which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores local land use and zoning regulations environmental regulations and other regulatory requirements may impact our ability to find suitable locations and influence the cost of constructing renovating and operating our stores in addition real estate zoning construction and other delays may adversely affect store openings and renovations and increase our costs further changing local demographics at existing store locations may adversely affect revenue and profitability levels at those stores the terms of leases at existing store locations may adversely affect us if the renewal terms of or requested modifications to those leases are unacceptable to us and we are forced to close or relocate stores if we are unable to maintain our existing store locations or open new locations in desirable places and on favorable terms our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 



our business and operations are subject to risks related to climate change 

the longterm effects of global climate change present both physical risks such as extreme weather conditions or rising sea levels and transition risks such as regulatory or technology changes which are expected to be widespread and unpredictable these changes could over time affect for example the availability and cost of products commodities and energy including utilities which in turn may impact our ability to procure goods or services required for the operation of our business at the quantities and levels we require in addition many of our operations and facilities around the world are in locations that may be impacted by the physical risks of climate change and we face the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to stores distribution or fulfillment centers loss or spoilage of inventory and business interruption caused by such events we also use natural gas diesel fuel gasoline and electricity in our operations all of which could face increased regulation as a result of climate change or other environmental concerns regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions and energy inputs may also increase in coming years which may increase our costs associated with compliance and merchandise these events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations and could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

risks relating to our business strategy 

we may not be successful in executing elements of our business strategy which may have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results 

we engage in strategic initiatives to among other reasons maximize longterm shareholder value expand on our consumercentric approach strengthen our partnerships with local healthcare providers and improve health outcomes these strategic initiatives may not result in improvements in future financial performance we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to successfully execute these strategic initiatives or that these initiatives will not result in additional unanticipated costs the failure to realize the benefits of any strategic initiatives or successfully structure our business to meet market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows or results of operations 

our growth strategy is partially dependent upon our ability to identify and successfully complete acquisitions joint ventures and other strategic partnerships and alliances 

a significant element of our growth strategy is to identify pursue and successfully complete and integrate acquisitions joint ventures and other strategic partnerships and alliances that either expand or complement our existing operations acquisitions and other strategic transactions involve numerous risks including difficulties in successfully integrating the operations and personnel navigating the necessary regulatory approval requirements distraction of management from overseeing and disruption of our existing operations difficulties in entering markets or lines of business in which we have no or limited direct prior experience the possible loss of key employees and customers and difficulties in achieving the synergies we anticipated any failure to select suitable opportunities at fair prices conduct appropriate due diligence acquire and successfully integrate the acquired company including particularly when acquired businesses operate in new geographic markets or areas of business could materially and adversely impact our growth strategies financial condition and results of operations our ability to integrate and retain qualified and experienced employees from acquired businesses at all levels including in executive and other key strategic positions is essential for us to meet our growth strategy and successfully complete acquisition joint ventures and other strategic partnerships and alliances 

these transactions may also cause us to significantly increase our interest expense leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition or investment issue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders’ percentage ownership or incur asset writeoffs and restructuring costs and other related expenses that could have a material adverse impact on our operating results acquisitions joint ventures and strategic investments also involve numerous other risks including potential exposure to assumed litigation and unknown environmental and other liabilities as well as undetected internal control regulatory or other issues or additional costs not anticipated at the time the transaction was completed 



businesses acquired as part of our us healthcare segment could experience losses or liabilities that would result in a material adverse effect on our business operations results of operation and financial condition 

healthcare businesses acquired as part of our us healthcare segment could experience losses or liabilities including medical liability claims causing us to incur significant expenses and requiring us to pay significant damages if not covered by insurance these businesses have in the past been subject to medical liability claims in the ordinary course of business and although we carry insurance covering medical malpractice claims including professional liability insurance in amounts we believe are appropriate in light of the risks attendant to our business successful medical liability claims could resulting in substantial damage awards that exceed the limits of our insurance coverage professional liability insurance is expensive and insurance premiums may increase significantly in the future particularly as we expand our services as a result adequate professional liability insurance may not be available to our providers or to us in the future at acceptable costs or at all any claims made against us or our acquired businesses that are not fully covered by insurance could be costly to defend against result in substantial damage awards against us and divert the attention of our management and our providers from our operations which could harm our business in addition any claims may significantly harm our business or reputation 

in addition the businesses acquired as part of our us healthcare segment expose us to risks that are inherent in the provision of healthcare services if patients clients or partners assert liability claims against us any ensuing litigation regardless of outcome could result in a substantial cost to us divert management’s attention from operations and decrease market acceptance of our services and care delivery model we do not control the providers and other healthcare professionals in our us healthcare segment with respect to the practice of medicine and the provision of healthcare services and the risk of liability including through unexpected medical outcomes is inherent to the healthcare industry 

the businesses acquired as part of the us healthcare segment have also entered and intend to continue to enter riskbased contracts with payors pursuant to which they contract with payors to receive a fee for professional services based on the number of patients assigned or attributed to us healthcare providers and assume the financial responsibility for the healthcare expenses of such patients these contracts may also include arrangements that contemplate sharing certain of the savings generated with respect to us healthcare segment’s patients’ costs of care back with the payor to the extent that patients require more care than is anticipated or the cost of care increases aggregate compensation amounts may be insufficient to cover the costs associated with treatment if medical costs and expenses exceed estimates except in very limited circumstances our healthcare businesses will not be able to increase the fee received under these risk agreements during their thencurrent terms and could suffer losses with respect to such agreements which may adversely impact the growth profitability and liquidity of our us healthcare segment 

the anticipated strategic and financial benefits of our relationship with amerisourcebergen may not be realized 

as of august 31 2022 we beneficially owned approximately 254 of the outstanding amerisourcebergen common stock and had designated one nominee for election to amerisourcebergen’s board of directors the company accounts for its investment in amerisourcebergen using the equity method of accounting subject to a twomonth reporting lag with the net earnings attributable to the investment classified within the operating income of the company’s us retail pharmacy segment the financial performance of amerisourcebergen including any charges which may arise relating to its ongoing opioid litigation matters will impact the company’s results of operations additionally a substantial and sustained decline in the price of amerisourcebergen’s common stock could trigger an impairment evaluation of our investment further our ability to transact in amerisourcebergen securities is subject to certain restrictions set forth in our agreements with amerisourcebergen and arising under applicable laws and regulations which in some circumstances could adversely impact our ability to transact in amerisourcebergen securities in amounts and at the times desired these considerations may materially and adversely affect the company’s financial condition and results of operations 



from time to time we may choose to divest certain assets or businesses as we execute our strategy and our ability to engage in such transactions will be subject to market conditions beyond our control which will affect our ability to transact on terms favorable to us or at all 

we have from time to time divested certain assets or businesses in order to redeploy capital into our core strategies the success of such transactions in the future will be subject to market conditions availability of financing and other circumstances beyond our control for instance on june 28 2022 we announced our decision to maintain the boots and no7 beauty company businesses under existing ownership this marked the conclusion of the review that began in january 2022 in line with our strategic priorities in the future we may intend to relaunch a process for the sale of the businesses or contemplate other opportunities to monetize our interest in these businesses in addition we have recently divested of a portion of our interests in amerisourcebergen see part ii item 7 investment in amerisourcebergen for further information and option care health inc and may choose to divest more of our interests in the future however our ability to divest these or any of our other assets will be subject to global financial markets and market instability which may severely impact the ability to divest divestiture terms financing availability and other considerations for potential buyers 

from time to time we make investments in companies over which we do not have sole control and some of these companies may operate in sectors that differ from our current operations and have different risks 

from time to time we make debt or equity investments in companies that we may not control or over which we may not have sole control some of the businesses in which we have made noncontrolling investments operate in markets or industries that are different from our primary lines of business andor operate in different geographic markets than we do investments in these businesses among other risks subject us to the operating and financial risks of the businesses we invest in and to the risk that we do not have sole control over the operations of these businesses we rely on the internal controls and financial reporting controls of these entities and their failure to maintain effectiveness or comply with applicable standards may materially and adversely affect us investments in entities over which we do not have sole control including joint ventures and strategic partnerships and alliances present additional risks such as having differing objectives from our partners or the entities in which we are invested becoming involved in disputes or competing with those persons 

cybersecurity data privacy and information security risks 

a significant disruption in our information technology and computer systems or those of businesses we rely on could harm us 

we rely extensively on our computer systems to manage our ordering pricing pointofsale pharmacy fulfillment inventory replenishment customer loyalty programs finance and other processes our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages facility damage computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches including credit card or personally identifiable information breaches vandalism theft natural disasters catastrophic events human error and potential cyber threats including malicious codes worms phishing attacks denial of service attacks ransomware and other sophisticated cyberattacks and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities if any of our systems are damaged fail to function properly or otherwise become unavailable we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience loss or corruption of critical data and interruptions or disruptions and delays in our ability to perform critical functions which could materially and adversely affect our businesses and results of operations 

in addition we are currently making and expect to continue to make substantial investments in our information technology systems and infrastructure some of which are significant implementing new systems carries significant potential risks including failure to operate as designed potential loss or corruption of data or information changes in security processes cost overruns implementation delays disruption of operations and the potential inability to meet business and reporting requirements we rely on strategic partners and other service providers to help us with certain significant information technology projects and services information technology projects or services frequently are longterm in nature and may take longer to complete and cost more than we expect and may not deliver the benefits we project once they are complete any system implementation and transition difficulty may result in operational challenges reputational harm and increased costs that could materially and adversely affect our business operations and results of operations we also could be adversely affected by any significant disruption in the systems of third parties we interact with including strategic and business partners key payers and vendors 



privacy and data protection laws increase our compliance burden and any failure to comply could harm us 

the regulatory environment surrounding data security and privacy is increasingly demanding with the frequent imposition of new and changing requirements across businesses and geographic areas we are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing data security and privacy regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate that regulate the collection use and transfer of personal data including the transfer of personal data between or among countries in the us for example hipaa imposes extensive privacy and security requirements governing the transmission use and disclosure of health information by covered entities in the healthcare industry including healthcare providers such as pharmacies in addition the california consumer privacy act which went into effect on january 1 2020 imposes stringent requirements on the use and treatment of “personal information” of california residents and other jurisdictions have enacted or are proposing similar laws related to the protection of personal data outside the us for example the european union’s general data protection regulation which became effective in may 2018 greatly increased the jurisdictional reach of european union data protection laws and added a broad array of requirements for handling personal data including the public disclosure of significant data breaches and provides for greater penalties for noncompliance other countries have enacted or are considering enacting data localization laws that require certain data to stay within their borders 

compliance with changes in privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes failure to comply with these laws subjects us to potential regulatory enforcement activity fines private litigation including class actions and other costs we also have contractual obligations that might be breached if we fail to comply a significant privacy breach or failure to comply with privacy and information security laws could have a materially adverse impact on our reputation business operations financial position and results of operations 

we and businesses we interact with experience cybersecurity incidents and might experience significant computer system compromises or data breaches 

the protection of customer employee and company data is critical to our businesses cybersecurity and other information technology security risks such as a significant breach or theft of customer employee or company data could create significant workflow disruption attract media attention damage our customer relationships reputation and brand and result in lost sales fines or lawsuits throughout our operations we receive retain and transmit certain personal information that our customers and others provide to purchase products or services fill prescriptions enroll in promotional programs participate in our customer loyalty programs and banking and credit programs register on our websites or otherwise communicate and interact with us in addition aspects of our operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks we also depend on and interact with the information technology networks and systems of thirdparties for many aspects of our business operations including payers strategic partners and cloud service providers these third parties may have access to information we maintain about our company operations customers employees and vendors or operating systems that are critical to or can significantly impact our business operations like other global companies we and businesses we interact with have experienced threats to data and systems including from vandalism or theft of physical systems or media and from perpetrators of random or targeted malicious cyberattacks computer viruses worms phishing attacks bot attacks or other destructive or disruptive software and attempts to misappropriate customer information including credit card information and cause system failures and disruptions 

compromises of our data security systems or of those of businesses with which we interact that result in confidential information being accessed obtained damaged or used by unauthorized or improper persons have in the past and could in the future adversely impact us any such compromise could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions customer attrition remediation expenses and claims from customers financial institutions payment card associations and other persons any of which could materially and adversely affect our reputation business operations financial condition and results of operations in addition security incidents may require that we expend substantial additional resources related to the security of information systems and disrupt our businesses the risks associated with data security and cybersecurity incidents have increased during covid19 given the increased reliance on remote work arrangements 



we are subject to paymentrelated and other financial services risks that could increase our operating costs expose us to fraud or theft subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business operations 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including cash checks credit and debit cards gift cards and mobile payment technologies such as apple pay™ and we may offer new payment options over time acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules regulations contractual obligations and compliance requirements including payment network rules and operating guidelines data security standards and certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers these requirements and related interpretations may change over time which has made and could continue to make compliance more difficult or costly for certain payment methods including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which could increase over time and raise our operating costs we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards and other forms of electronic payment if these companies become unable to provide these services to us or if their systems are compromised it could disrupt our business the payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by persons who seek to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit any weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems if we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements or if data is compromised due to a breach or misuse of data relating to our payment systems we may be liable for costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments could be impaired in addition our reputation could suffer and our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types which could result in higher costs andor reduced sales and materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

additionally we offer branded credit cards money wire transfer services and sell prepaid debit credit and gift cards at certain business units these products and services require us to comply with global antimoney laundering laws and regulations failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines sanctions penalties and damage to our reputation 

financial and accounting risks 

we have significant outstanding debt our debt and associated payment obligations could significantly increase in the future if we incur additional debt and do not retire existing debt 

we have outstanding debt and other financial obligations as of august 31 2022 we had approximately 117 billion of outstanding indebtedness including shortterm debt our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including 

• requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to amounts payable on our debt which would reduce the funds we have available for other purposes 

• making it more difficult or expensive for us to obtain any necessary future financing 

• reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our industry and market conditions and making us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business operations and 

• exposing us to interest rate risk given that a portion of our debt obligations and undrawn revolving credit facilities is at variable interest rates 

we may incur or assume significantly more debt in the future including in connection with acquisitions strategic investments or joint ventures if we add new debt and do not retire existing debt the risks described above could increase incurrence of additional debt by us and changes in our operating performance could also adversely affect our credit ratings any actual or anticipated downgrade of our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade or have been assigned a negative outlook could adversely affect our cost of funds liquidity financial covenants competitive position and access to capital markets and increase the cost of existing facilities which could materially and adversely affect our business operations financial condition and results of operations we also could be adversely impacted by any failure to renew or replace on terms acceptable to us or at all existing funding arrangements when they expire and any failure to satisfy applicable covenants 

our longterm debt obligations include covenants that may adversely affect our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur secured indebtedness or engage in certain types of transactions in addition our existing credit agreements require us to maintain as of the last day of each fiscal quarter a ratio of consolidated debt to total capitalization not to exceed a certain level our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants may be affected by events beyond our control if we breach any of these restrictions or covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable this could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition 



as a holding company we are dependent on funding from our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends and other obligations 

the company is a holding company with no business operations of its own its assets primarily consist of direct and indirect ownership interests in and its business is conducted through subsidiaries which are separate legal entities as a result it is dependent on funding from its subsidiaries including walgreens and international subsidiaries to pay dividends and meet its obligations the company’s subsidiaries may be restricted in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions to the company which may limit the payment of cash dividends or other distributions to the holders of the companys common stock credit facilities and other debt obligations of the company as well as statutory provisions may further limit the ability of the company and its subsidiaries to pay dividends payments to the company by its subsidiaries are also contingent upon its subsidiaries’ earnings and business considerations future dividends to the company will be determined based on earnings capital requirements financial condition and other factors considered relevant by its board of directors 

our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly based on seasonality and other factors 

our operating results have historically varied on a quarterly basis including increased variability during covid19 and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future for instance our businesses are seasonal in nature with the second fiscal quarter december january and february which falls during the holiday season typically generating a higher proportion of retail sales and earnings than other fiscal quarters in addition both prescription and nonprescription drug sales are affected by the timing and severity of the cough cold and flu season which can vary considerably from year to year other factors that may affect our quarterly operating results some of which are beyond the control of management include but are not limited to the impact and duration of covid19 the timing of the introduction of new generic and brand name prescription drugs inflation including with respect to generic drug procurement costs seasonality including the timing and severity of the cough cold and flu season changes or rates of change in payer reimbursement rates and terms the timing and amount of periodic contractual reconciliation payments fluctuations in inventory energy transportation labor healthcare and other costs significant acquisitions dispositions joint ventures and other strategic initiatives asset impairment charges including the performance of and impairment charges related to our equity method investments the relative magnitude of our lifo provision in any particular quarter foreign currency fluctuations market conditions widespread looting or vandalism and many of the other risk factors discussed herein accordingly we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and investors should not place undue reliance on the results of any particular quarter as an indication of our future performance 

we have a substantial amount of goodwill and other intangible assets which could in the future become impaired and result in material noncash charges to our results of operations 

as of august 31 2022 we had 223 billion of goodwill and 107 billion of other intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheets we evaluate this goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that could more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinitelived intangible asset below its carrying value as part of this impairment analysis we determine fair value for each reporting unit using both the income and market approaches we determine fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets using the relief from royalty method and excess earnings method of the income approach definitelived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable estimated fair values could change if for example there are changes in the business climate changes in the competitive environment adverse legal or regulatory actions or developments changes in capital structure cost of debt and equity capital expenditure levels operating cash flows or market capitalization whether due to covid19 or otherwise there can be no assurance that impairments will not occur and any impairment may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 



we are exposed to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

we operate or have equity method investments in several countries across the globe which expose us to currency exchange rate fluctuations and related risks including transaction currency exposures relating to the import and export of goods in currencies other than a businesses’ functional currencies as well as currency translation exposures relating to profits and net assets denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we present our financial statements in us dollars and have a significant proportion of net assets and income in nonus dollar currencies primarily the british pound sterling as well as a range of other foreign currencies our results of operations and capital ratios can therefore be sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future results of operations in addition fluctuations in currencies relative to the us dollar may make it more difficult to perform periodtoperiod comparisons of our reported results of operations a depreciation of nonus dollar currencies relative to the us dollar could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations 

we may from time to time in some instances enter into foreign currency contracts or other derivative instruments intended to hedge a portion of our foreign currency fluctuation risks which subjects us to additional risks such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations to us that could materially and adversely affect us additionally we may and currently do use foreign currency debt to hedge some of our foreign currency fluctuation risks the periodic use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place we cannot assure you that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will not materially affect our consolidated financial results 

we could be adversely impacted by changes in assumptions used in calculating pension assets and liabilities 

we operate certain defined benefit pension plans in the uk which were closed to new entrants in 2010 as well as smaller plans in other jurisdictions the valuation of the pension plans’ assets and liabilities depends in part on assumptions which are primarily based on the financial markets as well as longevity and employee retention rates this valuation is particularly sensitive to material changes in the value of equity bond and other investments held by the pension plans changes in the corporate bond yields which are used in the measurement of the liabilities changes in market expectations for longterm price inflation and other macroeconomic factors and new evidence on projected longevity rates funding requirements and the impact on the statement of earnings relating to these pension plans are also influenced by these factors adverse changes in the assumptions used to calculate the value of pension assets and liabilities including lower than expected pension fund investment returns andor increased life expectancy of plan participants or regulatory change could require us to increase the funding of its defined benefit pension plans or incur higher expenses which would adversely impact our results of operations and financial position 

risks from changes in public policy and other legal and regulatory risks 

changes in the healthcare industry and regulatory environments may adversely affect our businesses 

political economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to significant changes that could adversely affect our results of operations in recent years the healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to reduce costs and government spending these changes include an increased reliance on managed care cuts in certain medicare and medicaid funding in the us and the funding of governmental payers in foreign jurisdictions consolidation of competitors suppliers and other market participants and the development of large sophisticated purchasing groups in addition on august 16 2022 president biden signed into law the inflation reduction act of 2022 which among other things includes policies that are designed to have a direct impact on drug prices and reduce drug spending by the federal government which shall take effect in 2023 for example the inflation reduction act requires drug manufacturers to pay rebates to medicare if they increase prices faster than inflation for drugs used by medicare beneficiaries the mechanics of the rebate calculation would mimic those of the medicaid rebate but the expansion of inflationbased rebates may further complicate pricing strategies particularly as to the launch of our new products the inflation reduction act of 2022 could have the effect of reducing the prices we can charge and reimbursement we receive for our products thereby reducing our profitability 



we expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future some of these potential changes such as a reduction in governmental funding for certain healthcare services or adverse changes in legislation or regulations governing prescription drug pricing healthcare services or mandated benefits may cause customers to reduce the amount of our products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services we expect continued governmental and private payer pressure to reduce pharmaceutical pricing and these pressures could be further exacerbated if payer deficits or shortfalls increase due to covid19 or otherwise changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers’ pricing or distribution policies and practices as well as applicable government regulations including for example in connection with the federal 340b drug pricing program could also significantly reduce our profitability 

we are exposed to risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings 

we operate in a highly regulated and litigious environment we are involved in legal proceedings including litigation arbitration and other claims and investigations inspections audits claims inquiries and similar actions by pharmacy healthcare tax and other governmental authorities including those contained in note 11 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for further information for example in january 2019 walgreen co on behalf of itself its subsidiaries and certain identified affiliates resolved matters regarding certain dispensing practices by entering into among other things a corporate integrity agreement with the office of inspector general of the united states department of health and human services the corporate integrity agreement has a fiveyear term and provides that walgreen co shall among other things continue the compliance program it created to address compliance with federal healthcare program requirements provide annual certifications of compliance and provide training and education for certain covered employees failure to meet the corporate integrity agreement obligations could have material adverse consequences for us including reputational harm and monetary penalties for each instance of noncompliance in addition in the event of a breach or deliberate violation of the corporate integrity agreement we could be excluded from participation in federal healthcare programs or subjected to other significant penalties which could seriously harm our results of operations liquidity and financial results 

legal proceedings in general and securities derivative action and class action and multidistrict litigation in particular can be expensive and disruptive some of these suits may purport or may be determined to be class actions andor involve parties seeking large andor indeterminate amounts including punitive or exemplary damages and may remain unresolved for several years for example we are a defendant in numerous litigation proceedings relating to opioid matters including federal multidistrict litigation that consolidated numerous cases filed against an array of defendants by various plaintiffs such as counties cities hospitals indian tribes and others as well as numerous lawsuits brought in state courts additionally the company has received from the department of justice and the attorney generals of numerous states subpoenas civil investigative demands andor other requests concerning opioid matters the company incurs and expects to continue to incur significant expense in order to resolve those and other opioidsrelated matters including through settlement agreements from time to time the company is also involved in legal proceedings as a plaintiff involving antitrust tax contract intellectual property and other matters see note 11 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for further information 

the company’s financial results may also be adversely affected by the litigation and other legal proceedings of companies in which it has an equity method investment for example amerisourcebergen is involved in litigation and legal proceeding including those relating to opioid matters any unfavorable outcome or settlement related to these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results 

like other companies in the retail pharmacy healthcare services and pharmaceutical wholesale industries the company is subject to extensive regulation by national state and local government agencies in the us and other countries in which it operates there continues to be a heightened level of review andor audit by regulatory authorities of and increased litigation regarding business compliance and reporting practices of the company and other industry participants as a result the company regularly is the subject of government actions of the types described above in addition under the qui tam or “whistleblower” provisions of the federal and various state false claims acts persons may bring lawsuits alleging that a violation of the federal antikickback statute or similar laws has resulted in the submission of “false” claims to federal andor state healthcare programs including medicare and medicaid after a private party has filed a qui tam action the government must investigate the private partys claim and determine whether to intervene in and take control over the litigation these actions may remain under seal while the government makes this determination 



we cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies and the costs incurred in litigation can be substantial regardless of the outcome substantial unanticipated verdicts fines and rulings do sometimes occur as a result we could from time to time incur judgments enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters and such developments could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued andor our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid in addition as a result of governmental investigations or proceedings the company may be subject to damages civil or criminal fines or penalties or other sanctions including the possible suspension or loss of licensure andor suspension or exclusion from participation in government programs the outcome of some of these legal proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could negatively affect our operations additionally defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management’s attention and resources

introduction and segments 

walgreens boots alliance inc and its subsidiaries  “ walgreens boots alliance ” or the “ company ”  is a global leader in retail pharmacy and is positioning itself to become a leading provider of healthcare services its operations are conducted through three reportable segments 

• us retail pharmacy 

• international and 

• us healthcare 

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 the company changed the name of two reportable segments to better align with the company’s business activities structure and strategy the “united states” segment was renamed to “us retail pharmacy” and the “walgreens health” segment was renamed to “us healthcare” the segment name changes did not result in any change to the composition of the segments and therefore no change to the historical results of segment operations the information for these segments for all periods included in these consolidated financial statements has been presented using the new names see note 17 segment reporting and note 18 sales to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for further information 

factors trends and uncertainties affecting our results and comparability 

the company has been and we expect it to continue to be affected by a number of factors that may cause actual results to differ from our historical results or current expectations these factors include the impact of covid19 “covid19” on our operations and financial results the financial performance of our equity method investees including amerisourcebergen the influence of certain holidays seasonality foreign currency rates changes in vendor payer and customer relationships and terms and associated reimbursement pressure strategic transactions and acquisitions dispositions joint ventures and other strategic collaborations changes in laws including us tax law changes changes in trade tariffs including trade relations between the us and china and international relations including the uks withdrawal from the european union and its impact on our operations and prospects and those of our customers and counterparties the timing and magnitude of cost reduction initiatives including under our transformational cost management program as defined below the timing and severity of the cough cold and flu season fluctuations in variable costs the impacts of looting natural disasters war terrorism and other catastrophic events and changes in general economic conditions in the markets in which the company operates 

specialty pharmacy represents a significant and growing proportion of prescription drug spending in the us a significant portion of which is dispensed outside of traditional retail pharmacies to better serve the evolving specialty pharmacy market in march 2017 the company and prime therapeutics llc a pbm closed a transaction to form a combined central specialty pharmacy and mail services company alliancerx walgreens prime using an innovative model that sought to align pharmacy pbm and health plans to coordinate patient care improve health outcomes and deliver cost of care opportunities on december 31 2021 the company purchased prime’s portion of the joint venture and now wholly own the joint venture which was renamed alliancerx walgreens certain clients of alliancerx walgreens are not obligated to contract through alliancerx walgreens and have in the past and may in the future enter into specialty pharmacy and other agreements without involving alliancerx walgreens certain clients have chosen not to renew their contracts through alliancerx walgreens which impacts gross sales however considering the relatively low margin nature of this business the company does not anticipate this will have a material impact on operating income 

in january 2022 the company announced a strategic review of its boots business including the no7 beauty company in june 2022 the company announced the conclusion of the strategic review and decision to retain existing ownership in these businesses 



on may 5 2022 the company entered into an agreement with the state of florida to resolve all claims related to the distribution and dispensing of prescription opioid medications across the company’s pharmacies in the state of florida the settlement amount of 683 million includes 620 million to be paid in equal installments to the state of florida over 18 years and will be applied as remediation of past and future opioid damages as well as a onetime payment of 63 million for attorneys’ fees the company made the first annual settlement payment of 974 million into escrow on june 17 2022 

these and other factors can affect the company’s operations and net earnings for any period and may cause such results not to be comparable to the same period in previous years the results presented in this report are not necessarily indicative of future operating results 

covid19 

since the beginning of 2020 covid19 has severely impacted and may continue to directly and indirectly impact the economies of the us the uk and other countries around the world covid19 created significant public health concerns as well as significant volatility uncertainty and economic and supply chain disruption in every region in which we operate which has adversely affected our industries and our business operations further financial and credit markets experienced volatility and could continue to experience volatility due to covid19 and other factors as covid19 and its direct and indirect consequences continue to evolve covid19 has impacted and may again impact our business operations in response to covid19 and emerging variants various domestic and foreign federal state and local governmental legislation regulations orders policies and initiatives were implemented that were designed to reduce the transmission of covid19 as well as to help address economic and market volatility and instability resulting from covid19 the company has participated in certain of these programs including for example availing itself to certain tax deferrals which were introduced by the cares act in the us and certain tax deferral and benefit and employee wage support in the uk and if available may continue to do so in the future 

the company continues to play a critical role in fighting covid19 the company has worked with the centers for disease control and prevention “cdc” us department of health and human services “hhs” and the us government to help administer covid19 vaccinations to the general public and to high priority groups including longterm care facility residents and staff the us retail pharmacy segment also expanded vaccination models to ensure convenient access including sameday and walkin appointments mobile clinics employer partnerships and extended hours as of august 31 2022 the company has administered more than 69 million covid19 vaccinations including 23 million booster vaccinations and more than 45 million covid19 tests in the us in fiscal 2022 the company has administered approximately 35 million covid19 vaccinations and more than 31 million covid19 tests in the us 

in fiscal 2022 the us retail pharmacy segment comparable 30day equivalent prescriptions filled increased 13 including a positive impact of 12 basis points from covid19 vaccinations comparable retail sales increase was aided by athome covid19 test sales 

the company continues to monitor covid19 and its potential future impacts on the consumer customer and healthcare utilization patterns as well as the us and global economies including supply chains and the labor force as a result the financial andor operational impact on the company operating results cash flows andor financial condition is uncertain but the impact singularly or collectively could be material and adverse

net earnings from continuing operations fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 

fiscal 2022 net earnings attributable to the company were 43 billion compared to 20 billion for the prior year period diluted net earnings per share were 501 compared to 230 for the prior year period the increases in net earnings and diluted net earnings per share reflect a 25 billion aftertax gain during the three months ended november 30 2021 due to the remeasurement of the companys previously held minority equity and debt investments in villagemd and shields to fair value and a 12 billion charge net of tax from the companys equity earnings in amerisourcebergen in the prior fiscal year offset by the fiscal 2022 impairment charges related to intangible assets in boots uk and the charge related to the opioid settlement with the state of florida in fiscal 2022 

other income net in fiscal 2022 was 30 billion compared to 558 million in fiscal 2021 the increase in other income is mainly due to the remeasurement of the companys previously held equity and debt investments in villagemd and shields to fair value and the partial sale of the company’s equity method investments in amerisourcebergen and option care health 

net interest expense was 400 million and 905 million in fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively the decrease in interest expense was primarily the result of early debt extinguishments completed during fiscal 2021 and lower interest rates on remaining debt 

the companys effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 and 2021 was a 08 benefit and 334 respectively the net decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to pretax gains from the consolidation of the company’s investments in villagemd and shields for which a majority of these gains were not subject to tax additionally the company recognized tax benefit due to the reduction of a valuation allowance previously recorded against deferred tax assets related to capital loss carryforwards the reduction is primarily due to capital loss carryforwards utilized in the current year against capital gains recognized on the sale of shares in amerisourcebergen and option care capital gains recognized from internal restructuring and based on forecasted capital gains see note 3 acquisitions and other investments and note 6 equity method investments to the consolidated financial statement included in part ii item 8 for further information

critical accounting estimates 

the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and include amounts based on management’s prudent judgments and estimates actual results may differ from these estimates management believes that any reasonable deviation from those judgments and estimates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations to the extent that the estimates used differ from actual results however adjustments to the consolidated statements of earnings and corresponding consolidated balance sheets accounts would be necessary these adjustments would be made in future periods some of the more significant estimates include business combinations leases goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment longlived assets impairment cost of sales and inventory equity method investments pension and postretirement benefits legal contingencies and income taxes the company uses the following methods to determine its estimates 

  

business combinations – the company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that once control is obtained all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition the determination of fair values of assets and liabilities acquired requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available 

for intangible assets the company generally uses the income approach to determine fair value the income approach requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions primarily include but are not limited to discount rates terminal growth rates royalty rates forecasts of revenue operating income depreciation amortization and capital expenditures the discount rates applied to the projections reflect the risk factors associated with those projections 

although the company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on the determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired 

judgment is also required in determining the intangible asset’s useful life 

leases  the company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at the inception of a contract the lease classification is determined at the commencement date rightofuse assets represent the company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease during the lease term rightofuse assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of the remaining future minimum lease payments during the lease term lease commencement is the date the company has the right to control the property the company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments the incremental borrowing rate is based on the companys estimated rate of interest for a collateralized borrowing over a similar term as the lease term the operating lease rightofuse assets also include lease payments made before commencement lease incentives and are recorded net of impairment operating leases are expensed on a straight line basis over the lease term 

the lease term of real estate leases includes renewal options that are reasonably certain of being exercised options to extend are considered reasonably certain of being exercised based on evaluation if there are significant investments within the leased property which have useful lives greater than the noncancelable lease term performance of the underlying store and the company’s economic and strategic initiatives shortterm leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheets 

the company accounts for lease components and nonlease components as a single lease component variable lease payment amounts that cannot be determined at the commencement of the lease such as increases in lease payments based on changes in index rates or usage are not included in the rightofuse assets or lease liabilities these are expensed as incurred the company has real estate leases which require additional payments based on sales volume as well as reimbursement for real estate taxes common area maintenance and insurance which are expensed as incurred as variable lease costs and hence are not included in the lease payments used to calculate lease liability other real estate leases contain one fixed lease payment that includes real estate taxes common area maintenance and insurance these fixed payments are considered part of the lease payment and included in the rightofuse assets and lease liabilities the company does not separately account for the land portion of the leases involving land and building 

finance leases are recognized within property plant and equipment and as a finance lease liability within accrued expenses and other liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities 



goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment – goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that could more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or intangible asset below its carrying value as part of the company’s impairment analysis fair value of a reporting unit is generally determined using both the income and market approaches the income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit including projected future operating results economic projections anticipated future cash flows and discount rates the market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping as well as recent guideline transactions 

indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value indefinitelived intangible assets fair values are estimated using the relief from royalty method and excess earnings method of the income approach the determination of the fair value of the indefinitelived intangibles requires the company to make significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions primarily include but are not limited to forecasts of revenue the selection of appropriate royalty rate and discount rates 

the determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires the company to make significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the business and financial performance of the company’s reporting units these estimates and assumptions primarily include but are not limited to the selection of appropriate peer group companies control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we compete discount rates terminal growth rates forecasts of revenue operating income depreciation amortization and capital expenditures 

although the company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units and indefinitelived intangibles the amount of any goodwill and indefinitelived intangible impairment charges or both these estimates can be affected by a number of factors including but not limited to the impact of covid19 its severity duration and its impact on global economies general economic conditions as well as our profitability 

the company also compares the sum of estimated fair values of reporting units to the company’s fair value as implied by the market value of its equity securities this comparison provides an indication that in total assumptions and estimates are reasonable future declines in the overall market value of the company’s equity securities may provide an indication that the fair value of one or more reporting units has declined below its carrying value 

impairment of long lived assets – the company evaluates the recoverability of longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such an asset may not be recoverable the evaluation of longlived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows typically at the store level for retail pharmacy operations longlived assets related to the company’s retail pharmacy operations include property plant and equipment definitelived intangibles right of use asset as well as operating lease liability if the asset group fails the recoverability test then an impairment charge is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the asset group compared to its carrying value fair value of the asset group is generally determined using the income approach based on cash flows expected from the use and eventual disposal of the asset group 

the determination of the fair value of the asset group requires management to estimate a number of factors including anticipated future cash flows and discount rates although we believe these estimates are reasonable actual results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates 

cost of sales and inventory – 

retail pharmacy and wholesale 

cost of sales includes the purchase price of goods and cost of services rendered store and warehouse inventory loss inventory obsolescence warehousing costs for retail operations purchasing costs freight costs cash discounts vendor allowances and supplier rebates cost of sales is derived based upon pointofsale scanning information with an estimate for shrinkage and is adjusted based on periodic inventory counts 

the company values inventories on a lower of cost and net realizable value or market basis inventories include product costs inbound freight direct labor warehousing costs for retail pharmacy operations distribution of products and vendor allowances not classified as a reduction of advertising expensethe company’s us retail pharmacy segment inventory is accounted for using the lastinfirstout “lifo” method the company’s international segment inventory is accounted for using average cost and the firstinfirstout “fifo” method 



vendor allowances are principally received as a result of purchases sales or promotion of vendors’ products allowances are generally recorded as a reduction of inventory and are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales when the related merchandise is sold allowances received for promoting vendors’ products if received for a specific incremental identifiable cost are offset against advertising expense and result in a reduction of selling general and administrative expenses to the extent of advertising costs incurred with the excess treated as a reduction of inventory costs rebates or refunds received by the company from its suppliers mostly in cash are considered as an adjustment of the prices of the supplier’s products purchased by the company 

healthcare services 

for operations and activities related to the provision of healthcare cost of services includes activities that are directly related to the provision of care including medical claims expense cost of care clinic operating and support costs and allocated depreciation and amortization medical claims expense represents medical claims expenses related to feeforservice and valuebased arrangements and primarily includes costs for thirdparty healthcare service providers that provide medical care to patients cost of care represents the cost of our employed providers and certain affiliated providers including base compensation quality incentive bonuses and provider benefits clinic operating and support costs include costs incurred to operate our clinics including clinical care support staff patient support staff population health management employees rent utilities and supplies 

  

equity method investments   – the company uses the equity method of accounting for equity investments if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence but not control over operating and financial policies of the investee the company’s proportionate share of the net income or loss of these investees is included in consolidated net earnings judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as the company’s ownership interest legal form of the investee eg limited liability partnership representation on the board of directors participation in policymaking decisions and material intraentity transactions 

the company evaluates equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable factors considered by the company when reviewing an equity method investment for impairment include the length of time duration and the extent severity to which the fair value of the equity method investment has been less than cost the investee’s financial condition and nearterm prospects and the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery an impairment that is otherthantemporary is recognized in the period identified 

  

pension and postretirement benefits – the company has various defined benefit pension plans that cover some of its nonus employees the company also has a postretirement healthcare plan that covers qualifying us employees eligibility and the level of benefits for these plans vary depending on participants’ status date of hire and or length of service pension and postretirement healthcare plan expenses and valuations are dependent on assumptions used by thirdparty actuaries in calculating those amounts these assumptions include discount rates healthcare cost trends longterm return on plan assets retirement rates mortality rates and other factors 

in determining longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption the company considers both the historical performance of the investment portfolio as well as the longterm market return expectations based on the investment mix of the portfolio a change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on its pension expense a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in a decline of 213 million to the company’s pension benefit obligation a 25 basis point decrease on the expected return on plan assets assumption would increase the company’s pension expense by 16 million 

the company funds its pension plans in accordance with applicable regulations the postretirement healthcare plan is not funded 



contingencies – the company assesses its liabilities and contingencies for outstanding legal proceedings and reserves are established on a casebycase basis for those legal claims for which management concludes that it is probable that a loss will be incurred and that the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated substantially all of these contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and therefore determining the likelihood of a loss andor the measurement of any loss can be complex with respect to litigation and other legal proceedings where the company has determined that a loss is reasonably possible the company may be unable to estimate the amount or range of reasonably possible loss due to the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of and uncertainties regarding such litigation and legal proceedings the company’s assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management but that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause the company to change those estimates and assumptions therefore it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more pending litigation or other contingencies could have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial statements in a future fiscal period management’s assessment of current litigation and other legal proceedings including the corresponding accruals could change because of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions or other proceedings pending against the company which are not presently known adverse rulings or determinations by judges juries governmental authorities or other parties could also result in changes to management’s assessment of current liabilities and contingencies accordingly the ultimate costs of resolving these claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts reserved 

  

income taxes –the company is subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business us federal state local and foreign tax authorities raise questions regarding the company’s tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions in evaluating the tax benefits associated with the various tax filing positions the company records a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized adjustments are made to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which the company determines the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities the statute of limitations expires for the return containing the tax position or when more information becomes available the liability for unrecognized tax benefits including accrued penalties and interest is primarily included in other noncurrent liabilities and current income taxes on the company’s consolidated balance sheets and in income tax provision in its consolidated statements of earnings 

  

in determining its provision for income taxes the company uses income permanent differences between book and tax income and enacted statutory income tax rates the provision for income taxes rate also reflects its assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits in addition to any foreignbased income deemed to be taxable in the us discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur

the retail pharmacy industry across the globe relies significantly on private and governmental thirdparty payers many private organizations throughout the healthcare industry including pharmacy benefit management “pbm” companies and health insurance companies have consolidated in recent years to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater bargaining power thirdparty payers including the medicare part d plans and the statesponsored medicaid and related managed care medicaid agencies in the us can change eligibility requirements or reduce certain reimbursement rates in addition in many european countries the government provides or subsidizes healthcare to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices patient eligibility and reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored healthcare system changes in law or regulation also can impact reimbursement rates and terms for example the patient protection and affordable care act the “aca” was enacted to help control federal healthcare spending including for prescription drugs in the us these changes generally are expected to reduce medicaid reimbursements in the us state medicaid programs are also expected to continue to seek reductions in reimbursements when thirdparty payers or governmental authorities take actions that restrict eligibility or reduce prices or reimbursement rates sales and margins in the retail pharmacy industry could be reduced which would adversely affect industry profitability in some cases these possible adverse effects may be partially or entirely offset by controlling inventory costs and other expenses dispensing more higher margin generics finding new revenue streams through pharmacy services or other offerings andor dispensing a greater volume of prescriptions 



table of con t e n t 

these industry dynamics and challenges are continuous and have intensified in recent years since the completion of the strategic combination of walgreens and alliance boots in december 2014 the company has had a continuous focus on operational efficiencies and cost reduction 

generic prescription drugs have continued to help lower overall costs for customers and thirdparty payers the company expects the utilization of generic pharmaceuticals to continue to increase in general in the us generic versions of drugs generate lower sales dollars per prescription but higher gross profit dollars as compared with patentprotected brand name drugs the impact on retail pharmacy gross profit dollars can be significant in the first several months after a generic version of a drug is first allowed to compete with the branded version which is generally referred to as a “generic conversion” in any given year the number of major brand name drugs that undergo a conversion from branded to generic status can vary and the timing of generic conversions can be difficult to predict which can have a significant impact on retail pharmacy sales and gross profit dollars in general in the us the specialty prescription business is also growing and generates higher sales dollars per prescription but lower gross margin as compared to generic prescription drugs 

the company expects that market demand government regulation thirdparty reimbursement policies government contracting requirements and other pressures will continue to cause the industries in which the company competes to evolve pharmacists are on the frontlines of the healthcare delivery system and the company believes rising healthcare costs and the limited access to primary care physicians present opportunities for pharmacists and retail pharmacies to play an even greater role in driving positive outcomes for patients and payers through expanded service offerings

the components of the segment’s sales are pharmacy the sale of prescription drugs and provision of pharmacyrelated services and retail the sale of healthcare and retail products including nonprescription drugs health and wellness beauty and personal care and consumables and general merchandise the segment’s sales are subject to the influence of seasonality particularly the cough cold and flu seasons and winter holiday this seasonality also can affect the segment’s proportion of sales between retail and pharmacy during certain periods the components of the segment’s fiscal year sales were as follows 

the company filled 8275 million prescriptions including vaccinations in the segment in fiscal 2021 adjusted to 30day equivalents prescriptions filled were 12 billion in fiscal 2021 the company fills prescriptions under medicare medicaid and other publicly financed or sponsored health benefit and prescription drug plans and programs including the federal 340b drug pricing program sales where reimbursement is received from managed care organizations governmental agencies pbm companies and private insurance were approximately 97 of the segment’s fiscal 2021 pharmacy sales

amerisourcebergen supplies and distributes a significant amount of generic and branded pharmaceutical products to the segment’s pharmacies the company purchases its nonpharmaceutical merchandise from numerous manufacturers and wholesalers 

the segment’s sales gross profit margin and gross profit are impacted by among other things both the percentage of prescriptions filled that are generic and the rate at which new generic drugs are introduced to the market because any number of factors outside of the company’s control can affect timing for a generic conversion the company faces substantial uncertainty in predicting when such conversions will occur and what effect they will have on particular future periods 



table of con t e n t 

the current environment of the company’s pharmacy business also includes ongoing reimbursement pressure a shift in pharmacy mix towards 90day at retail one prescription that is the equivalent of three 30day prescriptions an increased volume of medicare part d prescriptions and increased consumer use of prescription discount cards further consolidation among generic manufacturers coupled with changes in the number of major brand name drugs anticipated to undergo a conversion from branded to generic status may also result in gross margin pressures within the industry 

the company continuously faces reimbursement pressure from pbm companies government health maintenance organizations managed care organizations and other commercial thirdparty payers agreements with these payers are regularly subject to expiration termination or renegotiation in addition plan changes with rate adjustments often occur in january and the company’s reimbursement arrangements may provide for rate adjustments at prescribed intervals during their term the company experienced lower reimbursement rates in fiscal 2021 as compared to the same period in the prior year the company expects these pressures to continue 

the company has also worked to develop and expand its relationships with commercial thirdparty payers to enable new andor improved market access via participation in pharmacy provider networks they offer the prescription volume impact of new agreements and relationships typically is incremental over time 

the company’s 90day at retail prescription drug offering is typically at a lower margin than comparable 30day prescriptions but provides the company with the opportunity to increase business with patients with chronic prescription needs while offering increased convenience helping facilitate improved prescription adherence and resulting in a lower cost to fill the 90day prescription similarly the specialty prescription business which generates higher sales dollars per prescription may result in gross margin pressures within the industry as compared to generic prescription drugs the segment’s performance is also impacted by the current environment including the uncertainty as a result of covid19 for more information see risk factors in item 1a below

the covid19 pandemic has severely impacted and may continue to severely impact the economies of the us the uk and other countries around the world over the course of fiscal 2021 governmental authorities imposed a variety of restrictions on people and businesses and public health authorities offered regular guidance on health and safety all of which had an adverse impact on footfall in our stores general economic activity and consumer behavior and spending patterns covid19 has created significant public health concerns as well as significant volatility uncertainty and economic disruption in every region in which we operate all of which have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations even as efforts to contain the pandemic including vaccinations have made progress and some restrictions have relaxed new variants of the virus are causing additional outbreaks and there is substantial uncertainty about the nature and degree of the continued effects of covid19 over time 

the pandemic and related measures have impacted and may continue to impact many aspects of our business financial condition and results of operations in a number of ways including but not limited to our growth product costs supply chain disruptions and the potential for inventory spoilage labor shortages and costs operating costs logistics constraints customer demand for our products and industry demand generally consumer spending our liquidity the price of our securities our ability to access capital markets and the global economy and financial markets generally 

we have incurred and continue to incur additional costs to protect the health and wellbeing and meet the needs of our customers and team members these measures may not be sufficient to prevent the spread of covid19 among our customers and employees illness travel restrictions absenteeism or other workforce disruptions could negatively affect our business operations further the shift to a remote working environment and other policies has and will continue to have impacts on our business including increased costs related to information technology infrastructure and the ability of our business and that of our suppliers to work with the same productivity the increase in remote work arrangements has increased certain operational risks including but not limited to cybersecurity risks and could adversely affect our ability to manage our business 

we are continuing to monitor the pandemic and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations and requirements of relevant authorities the extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our future operational and financial performance is currently uncertain and will depend on many factors outside our control including without limitation the timing extent trajectory and duration of the pandemic the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines the imposition of public safety measures and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy potential negative impacts of these external factors include but are not limited to material adverse effects on demand for our products and services our supply chain and sales and distribution channels our ability to execute strategic plans impairments and our profitability and cost structure to the extent the covid19 pandemic adversely affects our business results of operations and financial condition it may also have the effect of exacerbating the other risks discussed in this “risk factors” section

reductions in thirdparty reimbursement levels from private or governmental agency plans and potential changes in industry pricing benchmarks for prescription drugs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

the substantial majority of the prescriptions we fill are reimbursed by thirdparty payers including private and governmental agency payers the continued efforts of health maintenance organizations managed care organizations pbm companies governmental agencies and other thirdparty payers to reduce prescription drug costs and pharmacy reimbursement rates as well as litigation and other legal proceedings relating to how drugs are priced may adversely impact our results of operations in the us plan changes with rate adjustments often occur in january and our reimbursement arrangements may provide for rate adjustments at prescribed intervals during their term in addition the timing and amount of periodic contractual reconciliations payments can vary significantly and may not follow a predictable path further in an environment where some pbm clients utilize narrow or restricted pharmacy provider networks some of these entities may offer pricing terms that we may not be willing to accept or otherwise restrict our participation in their networks of pharmacy providers 

in addition many payers in the us are increasingly considering new metrics as the basis for reimbursement rates it is possible that the pharmaceutical industry or regulators may evaluate andor develop an alternative pricing reference to replace average wholesale price which is the pricing reference used for many of our contracts in addition many state medicaid feeforservice programs have established pharmacy network payments on the basis of actual acquisition cost which could have an impact on reimbursement practices in other commercial and governmental arrangements future changes to the pricing benchmarks used to establish pharmaceutical pricing including changes in the basis for calculating reimbursement by thirdparty payers could adversely affect us 

a shift in pharmacy mix toward lower margin plans products and programs could adversely affect our results of operations 

our united states segment seeks to grow prescription volume while operating in a marketplace with continuous reimbursement pressure a shift in the mix of pharmacy prescription volume towards programs offering lower reimbursement rates could adversely affect our results of operations for example our united states segment has experienced a shift in pharmacy mix towards 90day at retail in recent years and more recently during the covid19 pandemic and specialty pharmacy represents a significant and growing proportion of prescription drug spending in the us and a larger proportion of our revenues our 90day at retail offering for patients with chronic prescription needs typically is at a lower margin than comparable 30day prescriptions and specialty pharmacy sales are generally also lower margin our united states segment also has experienced a shift in pharmacy mix towards medicare part d prescriptions in recent years and that trend may continue preferred medicare part d networks have increased in number in recent years however we do not participate in all such networks we have accepted market competitive reimbursement rates in order to secure preferred relationships with medicare part d plans serving senior patients with significant pharmacy needs we also have worked to develop and expand our relationships with commercial thirdparty payers to enable new andor improved market access via participation in the pharmacy provider networks they offer if we are not able to generate additional prescription volume and other business from patients participating in these programs that is sufficient to offset the impact of lower reimbursement or if the degree or terms of our participation in such preferred networks declines from current levels in future years our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we derive a significant portion of our sales in the us from prescription drug sales reimbursed by a limited number of pharmacy benefit management companies 

we derive a significant portion of our sales in the us from prescription drug sales reimbursed through prescription drug plans administered by a limited number of pbm companies pbm companies typically administer multiple prescription drug plans that expire at various times and provide for varying reimbursement rates and often limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list known as a formulary which might not include all of the approved drugs for a particular indication changes in pricing and other terms of our contracts with pbm companies can significantly impact our results of operations there can be no assurance that we will continue to participate in any particular pbm company’s pharmacy provider network in any particular future time period or on terms reasonably acceptable to us if our participation in the pharmacy provider network for a prescription drug plan administered by one or more of the large pbm companies is restricted or terminated we expect that our sales would be adversely affected at least in the shortterm if we are unable to replace any such lost sales either through an increase in other sales or through a resumption of participation in those plans our operating results could be materially and adversely affected if we exit a pharmacy provider network and later resume participation there can be no assurance that we will achieve any particular level of business on any particular pace or that all clients of the pbm company will choose to include us again in the pharmacy network for their plans initially or at all in addition in such circumstances we may incur increased marketing and other costs in connection with initiatives to regain former patients and attract new patients covered by such plans

we could be adversely affected by a decrease in the introduction of new brand name and generic prescription drugs as well as increases in the cost to procure prescription drugs 

the profitability of our pharmacy businesses depends upon the utilization of prescription drugs utilization trends are affected by among other factors the introduction of new and successful prescription drugs as well as lowerpriced generic alternatives to existing brand name drugs inflation in the price of drugs also can adversely affect utilization particularly given the increased prevalence of highdeductible health insurance plans and related plan design changes new brand name drugs can result in increased drug utilization and associated sales while the introduction of lower priced generic alternatives typically results in relatively lower sales but relatively higher gross profit margins accordingly a decrease in the number or magnitude of significant new brand name drugs or generics successfully introduced delays in their introduction or a decrease in the utilization of previously introduced prescription drugs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

in addition if we experience an increase in the amounts we pay to procure pharmaceutical drugs including generic drugs our gross profit margins would be adversely affected to the extent we are not able to offset such cost increases any failure to fully offset any such increased prices and costs or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations also any future changes in drug prices could be significantly different than our expectations 

consolidation and strategic alliances in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business operations competitive positioning financial condition and results of operations 

many organizations in the healthcare industry including pbm companies have consolidated in recent years to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater bargaining power which has resulted in greater pricing pressures if this consolidation trend continues it could give the resulting enterprises even greater bargaining power which may lead to further pressure on the prices for our products and services if these pressures result in reductions in our prices our businesses would become less profitable unless we are able to achieve corresponding reductions in costs or develop profitable new revenue streams 

our business results depend on our ability to successfully manage ongoing organizational change and business transformation and achieve cost savings and operating efficiency initiatives 

our board of directors approved the plans to increase the transformational cost management program described in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii item 7 below as part of an initiative to reduce costs and increase operating efficiencies there can be no assurance that we will realize in full or in part the anticipated benefits of these programs our financial goals assume a level of productivity improvement including those reflected in the transformational cost management program and other business optimization initiatives if we are unable to implement the programs or deliver these expected productivity improvements while continuing to invest in business growth or if the volume and nature of change overwhelms available resources our business operations financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted 

changes in economic conditions could adversely affect consumer buying practices 

our performance has been and may continue to be adversely impacted by changes in global national regional or local economic conditions and consumer confidence these conditions can also adversely affect our key vendors and customers external factors that affect consumer confidence and over which we exercise no influence include unemployment rates inflation levels of personal disposable income levels of taxes and interest and global national regional or local economic conditions health epidemics or pandemics such as covid19 as well as looting vandalism acts of war or terrorism changes in economic conditions and consumer confidence could adversely affect consumer preferences purchasing power and spending patterns which could lead to a decrease in overall consumer spending as well as in prescription drug and health services utilization and which could be exacerbated by the increasing prevalence of highdeductible health insurance plans and related plan design changes in addition reduced or flat consumer spending may drive us and our competitors to offer additional products at promotional prices all of these factors could materially and adversely impact our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and constantly evolving and changes in market dynamics could adversely impact us 

the level of competition in the retail pharmacy and pharmaceutical wholesale industries is high changes in market dynamics or actions of competitors or manufacturers including industry consolidation and the emergence of new competitors and strategic alliances could materially and adversely impact us disruptive innovation or the perception of potentially disruptive 



table of con t e n t 

innovation by existing or new competitors could alter the competitive landscape in the future and require us to accurately identify and assess such changes and if required make timely and effective changes to our strategies and business model to compete effectively all of our businesses face intense competition from multiple existing and new businesses some of which are aggressively expanding in markets we serve we continue to develop our offerings to respond to market dynamics however if our customers are not receptive to these changes if we are unable to expand successful programs in a timely manner or we otherwise do not effectively respond to changes in market dynamics our businesses and financial performance could be materially and adversely affected 

specialty pharmacy represents a significant and growing proportion of prescription drug spending in the us a significant portion of which is dispensed outside of traditional retail pharmacies because our specialty pharmacy business focuses on complex and highcost medications many of which are made available by manufacturers to a limited number of pharmacies socalled limited distribution drugs that serve a relatively limited universe of patients the future growth of this business depends to a significant extent upon expanding our ability to access key drugs and successfully penetrate key treatment categories accordingly it is important that we and our affiliates compete effectively in this evolving and highly competitive market or our business operations financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected to better serve this evolving market in march 2017 we and prime therapeutics llc a pbm closed a transaction to form a combined central specialty pharmacy and mail services company alliancerx walgreens prime using an innovative model that seeks to align pharmacy pbm and health plans to coordinate patient care improve health outcomes and deliver cost of care opportunities certain clients of our joint venture were and are not obligated to contract through our joint venture and have in the past and may in the future enter into specialty pharmacy and other agreements without involving our joint venture if this joint venture is not able to compete effectively in this evolving and highly competitive market and successfully adapt to changing market conditions our business operations financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

if we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant omnichannel experience for our customers our businesses and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

the portion of total consumer expenditures with retailers occurring online and through mobile applications has continued to increase and has accelerated significantly during the covid19 pandemic the pace of this increase could further accelerate in the future our business has evolved from an instore experience to interaction with customers across numerous channels including instore online mobile and social media among others omnichannel and differentiated retail models are rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing customer expectations and new developments by our competitors we must compete by offering a consistent and convenient shopping experience for our customers regardless of the ultimate sales channel and by investing in providing and maintaining digital tools for our customers if we are unable to make improve or develop relevant customerfacing technology in a timely manner that keeps pace with technological developments and dynamic customer expectations our ability to compete and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected in addition if our online activities or our other customerfacing technology systems do not function as designed we may experience a loss of customer confidence data security breaches lost sales or be exposed to fraudulent purchases any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations reputation and results of operations 

if the merchandise and services that we offer fail to meet customer needs our sales may be adversely affected 

the success of our retail pharmacy businesses depends on our ability to offer a superior shopping experience engaging customer service and a quality assortment of available merchandise that differentiates us from other retailers including enhanced health and beauty product offerings we must identify obtain supplies of and offer to our customers attractive innovative and highquality merchandise on a continuous basis it is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand if we misjudge the demand for products and services we sell or our customers’ purchasing habits we may be faced with sales declines excess product inventories and missed opportunities for products and services we chose not to offer which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations 

our substantial international business operations subject us to a number of operating economic political regulatory and other international business risks 

our substantial international business operations are important to our growth and prospects including particularly those of our international segment and are subject to a number of risks including without limitation compliance with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations potential difficulties in managing foreign operations mitigating credit risks in foreign markets enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems varying regional and geopolitical business conditions and demands tax and trade policies tariffs and other government regulations affecting trade between the us and other countries fluctuations in currency exchange rates the impact of recessions and economic slowdowns in economies 



table of con t e n t 

outside the us and the instability of foreign economies governments and currencies and unexpected regulatory economic or political changes in foreign markets 

these factors can also adversely affect our payers vendors and customers in international markets which in turn can negatively impact our businesses we cannot assure you that one or more of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations results of operation and financial condition 

risks related to our operations 

disruption in our global supply chain could negatively impact our businesses 

the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors and any future disruption in our supply chain or inability to find qualified vendors and access products that meet requisite quality and safety standards in a timely and efficient manner could adversely impact our businesses the loss or disruption of such supply arrangements for any reason including for issues such as covid19 or other health epidemics or pandemics labor disputes loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites inability to procure sufficient raw materials quality control issues ethical sourcing issues a supplier’s financial distress natural disasters looting vandalism or acts of war or terrorism trade sanctions or other external factors over which we have no control could interrupt product supply and if not effectively managed and remedied have a material adverse impact on our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

we outsource certain business processes to thirdparty vendors that subject us to risks including disruptions in business and increased costs 

we outsource certain business and administrative functions and rely on third parties to perform certain services on our behalf we rely on these third parties to meet our quality and performance requirements and to timely perform as expected if our continuing relationship with certain thirdparty providers is interrupted or if such thirdparty providers experience disruptions or do not perform as anticipated or we experience problems with any transition we may experience operational difficulties reputational harm and increased costs that could materially and adversely affect our business operations and results of operations 

we use a single wholesaler of branded and generic pharmaceutical drugs as our primary source of such products 

the company and amerisourcebergen are parties to various agreements and arrangements including a pharmaceutical distribution agreement between the company and amerisourcebergen pursuant to which we source branded and generic pharmaceutical products from amerisourcebergen in the us and an agreement which provides amerisourcebergen the ability to access generic pharmaceutical products through our global sourcing enterprise these agreements were amended in june 2021 in connection with the alliance healthcare sale pursuant to those amendments the us distribution agreement was extended through 2029 and the parties committed to pursue additional opportunities in sourcing and distribution the parties also agreed that alliance healthcare uk will remain the distribution partner of boots until 2031 as of the date of this report amerisourcebergen distributes substantially all of our branded and generic pharmaceutical products consequently our business may be adversely affected by any operational financial or regulatory difficulties that amerisourcebergen experiences including those resulting from covid19 for example if amerisourcebergen’s operations are seriously disrupted for any reason whether due to a natural disaster pandemic labor disruption regulatory action computer or operational systems or otherwise it could adversely affect our business and our results of operations 

our distribution agreement with amerisourcebergen is subject to early termination in certain circumstances and upon the expiration or termination of the agreement there can be no assurance that we or amerisourcebergen will be willing to renew the agreement or enter into a new agreement on terms favorable to us or at all if such expiration or termination occurred we believe that alternative sources of supply for most generic and brandname pharmaceuticals are readily available and that we could obtain and qualify alternative sources which may include selfdistribution in some cases for substantially all of the prescription drugs we sell on an acceptable basis such that the impact of any such expiration or termination would be temporary however there can be no assurance we would be able to engage alternative supply sources or implement selfdistribution processes on a timely basis or on terms favorable to us or effectively manage these transitions any of which could adversely affect our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

failure to retain and recruit or failure to manage succession of key personnel could have an adverse impact on our future performance 



table of con t e n t 

our ability to attract engage develop and retain qualified and experienced employees at all levels including in executive and other key strategic positions is essential for us to meet our objectives competition among potential employers might result in increased salaries benefits or other employeerelated costs or in our failure to recruit and retain employees which could have a materially adverse impact on our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

additionally any failure to adequately plan for and manage succession of key management roles or the failure of key employees to successfully transition into new roles could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations while we have succession plans in place and employment arrangements with certain key executives these do not guarantee the services of these executives will continue to be available to us 

we may be unable to keep existing store locations or open new locations in desirable places on favorable terms which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores local land use and zoning regulations environmental regulations and other regulatory requirements may impact our ability to find suitable locations and influence the cost of constructing renovating and operating our stores in addition real estate zoning construction and other delays may adversely affect store openings and renovations and increase our costs further changing local demographics at existing store locations may adversely affect revenue and profitability levels at those stores the terms of leases at existing store locations may adversely affect us if the renewal terms of or requested modifications to those leases are unacceptable to us and we are forced to close or relocate stores if we are unable to maintain our existing store locations or open new locations in desirable places and on favorable terms our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

our business and operations are subject to risks related to climate change 

the longterm effects of global climate change present both physical risks such as extreme weather conditions or rising sea levels and transition risks such as regulatory or technology changes which are expected to be widespread and unpredictable these changes could over time affect for example the availability and cost of products commodities and energy including utilities which in turn may impact our ability to procure goods or services required for the operation of our business at the quantities and levels we require in addition many of our operations and facilities around the world are in locations that may be impacted by the physical risks of climate change and we face the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to stores distribution or fulfillment centers loss or spoilage of inventory and business interruption caused by such events we also use natural gas diesel fuel gasoline and electricity in our operations all of which could face increased regulation as a result of climate change or other environmental concerns regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions and energy inputs may also increase in coming years which may increase our costs associated with compliance and merchandise these events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations and could materially adversely affect our financial performance 

risks relating to our business strategy 

we may not be successful in executing elements of our business strategy which may have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results 

we engage in strategic initiatives to among other reasons maximize longterm shareholder value expand on our consumercentric approach strengthen our partnerships with local healthcare providers and improve health outcomes these strategic initiatives may not result in improvements in future financial performance we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to successfully execute these strategic initiatives or that these initiatives will not result in additional unanticipated costs the failure to realize the benefits of any strategic initiatives or successfully structure our business to meet market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows or results of operations 

our growth strategy is partially dependent upon our ability to identify and successfully complete acquisitions joint ventures and other strategic partnerships and alliances 

a significant element of our growth strategy is to identify pursue and successfully complete and integrate acquisitions joint ventures and other strategic partnerships and alliances that either expand or complement our existing operations acquisitions and other strategic transactions involve numerous risks including difficulties in successfully integrating the operations and personnel navigating the necessary regulatory approval requirements distraction of management from overseeing and disruption of our existing operations difficulties in entering markets or lines of business in which we have no or limited direct prior experience the possible loss of key employees and customers and difficulties in achieving the synergies we anticipated any failure to select suitable opportunities at fair prices conduct appropriate due diligence acquire and successfully integrate 



table of con t e n t 

the acquired company including particularly when acquired businesses operate in new geographic markets or areas of business could materially and adversely impact our growth strategies financial condition and results of operations 

these transactions may also cause us to significantly increase our interest expense leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition or investment issue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders’ percentage ownership or incur asset writeoffs and restructuring costs and other related expenses that could have a material adverse impact on our operating results acquisitions joint ventures and strategic investments also involve numerous other risks including potential exposure to assumed litigation and unknown environmental and other liabilities as well as undetected internal control regulatory or other issues or additional costs not anticipated at the time the transaction was completed 

the anticipated strategic and financial benefits of our relationship with amerisourcebergen may not be realized 

as of august 31 2021 we beneficially owned approximately 285 of the outstanding amerisourcebergen common stock and had designated one nominee for election to amerisourcebergen’s board of directors the company accounts for its investment in amerisourcebergen using the equity method of accounting subject to a twomonth reporting lag with the net earnings attributable to the investment classified within the operating income of the company’s united states segment the financial performance of amerisourcebergen including any charges which may arise relating to its ongoing opioid litigation matters will impact the company’s results of operations additionally a substantial and sustained decline in the price of amerisourcebergen’s common stock could trigger an impairment evaluation of our investment further our ability to transact in amerisourcebergen securities is subject to certain restrictions set forth in our agreements with amerisourcebergen and arising under applicable laws and regulations which in some circumstances could adversely our ability to transact in amerisourcebergen securities in amounts and at the times desired these considerations may materially and adversely affect the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we make investments in companies over which we do not have sole control and some of these companies may operate in sectors that differ from our current operations and have different risks 

from time to time we make debt or equity investments in companies that we may not control or over which we may not have sole control some of the businesses in which we have made noncontrolling investments operate in markets or industries that are different from our primary lines of business andor operate in different geographic markets than we do investments in these businesses among other risks subject us to the operating and financial risks of the businesses we invest in and to the risk that we do not have sole control over the operations of these businesses we rely on the internal controls and financial reporting controls of these entities and their failure to maintain effectiveness or comply with applicable standards may materially and adversely affect us investments in entities over which we do not have sole control including joint ventures and strategic partnerships and alliances present additional risks such as having differing objectives from our partners or the entities in which we are invested becoming involved in disputes or competing with those persons 

cybersecurity data privacy and information security risks 

a significant disruption in our information technology and computer systems or those of businesses we rely on could harm us 

we rely extensively on our computer systems to manage our ordering pricing pointofsale pharmacy fulfillment inventory replenishment customer loyalty programs finance and other processes our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages facility damage computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches including credit card or personally identifiable information breaches vandalism theft natural disasters catastrophic events human error and potential cyber threats including malicious codes worms phishing attacks denial of service attacks ransomware and other sophisticated cyberattacks and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities if any of our systems are damaged fail to function properly or otherwise become unavailable we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience loss or corruption of critical data and interruptions or disruptions and delays in our ability to perform critical functions which could materially and adversely affect our businesses and results of operations 

in addition we are currently making and expect to continue to make substantial investments in our information technology systems and infrastructure some of which are significant implementing new systems carries significant potential risks including failure to operate as designed potential loss or corruption of data or information changes in security processes cost overruns implementation delays disruption of operations and the potential inability to meet business and reporting requirements we rely on strategic partners and other service providers to help us with certain significant information technology projects and services information technology projects or services frequently are longterm in nature and may take longer to complete and cost more than we expect and may not deliver the benefits we project once they are complete any system implementation and transition difficulty may result in operational challenges reputational harm and increased costs that 



table of con t e n t 

could materially and adversely affect our business operations and results of operations we also could be adversely affected by any significant disruption in the systems of third parties we interact with including strategic and business partners key payers and vendors 

privacy and data protection laws increase our compliance burden and any failure to comply could harm us 

the regulatory environment surrounding data security and privacy is increasingly demanding with the frequent imposition of new and changing requirements across businesses and geographic areas we are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing data security and privacy regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate that regulate the collection use and transfer of personal data including the transfer of personal data between or among countries in the us for example hipaa imposes extensive privacy and security requirements governing the transmission use and disclosure of health information by covered entities in the health care industry including health care providers such as pharmacies in addition the california consumer privacy act which went into effect on january 1 2020 imposes stringent requirements on the use and treatment of “personal information” of california residents and other jurisdictions have enacted or are proposing similar laws related to the protection of personal data outside the us for example the european union’s general data protection regulation which became effective in may 2018 greatly increased the jurisdictional reach of european union data protection laws and added a broad array of requirements for handling personal data including the public disclosure of significant data breaches and provides for greater penalties for noncompliance other countries have enacted or are considering enacting data localization laws that require certain data to stay within their borders 

compliance with changes in privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes failure to comply with these laws subjects us to potential regulatory enforcement activity fines private litigation including class actions and other costs we also have contractual obligations that might be breached if we fail to comply a significant privacy breach or failure to comply with privacy and information security laws could have a materially adverse impact on our reputation business operations financial position and results of operations 

we and businesses we interact with experience cybersecurity incidents and might experience significant computer system compromises or data breaches 

the protection of customer employee and company data is critical to our businesses cybersecurity and other information technology security risks such as a significant breach or theft of customer employee or company data could create significant workflow disruption attract media attention damage our customer relationships reputation and brand and result in lost sales fines or lawsuits throughout our operations we receive retain and transmit certain personal information that our customers and others provide to purchase products or services fill prescriptions enroll in promotional programs participate in our customer loyalty programs and banking and credit programs register on our websites or otherwise communicate and interact with us in addition aspects of our operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks we also depend on and interact with the information technology networks and systems of thirdparties for many aspects of our business operations including payers strategic partners and cloud service providers these third parties may have access to information we maintain about our company operations customers employees and vendors or operating systems that are critical to or can significantly impact our business operations like other global companies we and businesses we interact with have experienced threats to data and systems including from vandalism or theft of physical systems or media and from perpetrators of random or targeted malicious cyberattacks computer viruses worms phishing attacks bot attacks or other destructive or disruptive software and attempts to misappropriate customer information including credit card information and cause system failures and disruptions 

compromises of our data security systems or of those of businesses with which we interact that result in confidential information being accessed obtained damaged or used by unauthorized or improper persons have in the past and could in the future adversely impact us any such compromise could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions customer attrition remediation expenses and claims from customers financial institutions payment card associations and other persons any of which could materially and adversely affect our reputation business operations financial condition and results of operations in addition security incidents may require that we expend substantial additional resources related to the security of information systems and disrupt our businesses the risks associated with data security and cybersecurity incidents have increased during the covid19 pandemic given the increased reliance on remote work arrangements 

we are subject to paymentrelated and other financial services risks that could increase our operating costs expose us to fraud or theft subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business operations 



table of con t e n t 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including cash checks credit and debit cards gift cards and mobile payment technologies such as apple pay™ and we may offer new payment options over time acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules regulations contractual obligations and compliance requirements including payment network rules and operating guidelines data security standards and certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers these requirements and related interpretations may change over time which has made and could continue to make compliance more difficult or costly for certain payment methods including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which could increase over time and raise our operating costs we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards and other forms of electronic payment if these companies become unable to provide these services to us or if their systems are compromised it could disrupt our business the payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by persons who seek to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit any weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems if we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements or if data is compromised due to a breach or misuse of data relating to our payment systems we may be liable for costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments could be impaired in addition our reputation could suffer and our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types which could result in higher costs andor reduced sales and materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

additionally we offer branded credit cards money wire transfer services and sell prepaid debit credit and gift cards at certain business units these products and services require us to comply with global antimoney laundering laws and regulations failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines sanctions penalties and damage to our reputation 

financial and accounting risks 

we have significant outstanding debt our debt and associated payment obligations could significantly increase in the future if we incur additional debt and do not retire existing debt 

we have outstanding debt and other financial obligations as of august 31 2021 we had approximately 90 billion of outstanding indebtedness including shortterm debt our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including 

• requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to amounts payable on our debt which would reduce the funds we have available for other purposes 

• making it more difficult or expensive for us to obtain any necessary future financing 

• reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our industry and market conditions and making us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business operations and 

• exposing us to interest rate risk given that a portion of our debt obligations and undrawn revolving credit facilities is at variable interest rates 

we may incur or assume significantly more debt in the future including in connection with acquisitions strategic investments or joint ventures if we add new debt and do not retire existing debt the risks described above could increase incurrence of additional debt by us and changes in our operating performance could also adversely affect our credit ratings any actual or anticipated downgrade of our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade or have been assigned a negative outlook could adversely affect our cost of funds liquidity financial covenants competitive position and access to capital markets and increase the cost of existing facilities which could materially and adversely affect our business operations financial condition and results of operations we also could be adversely impacted by any failure to renew or replace on terms acceptable to us or at all existing funding arrangements when they expire and any failure to satisfy applicable covenants 

our longterm debt obligations include covenants that may adversely affect our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur secured indebtedness or engage in certain types of transactions in addition our existing credit agreements require us to maintain as of the last day of each fiscal quarter a ratio of consolidated debt to total capitalization not to exceed a certain level our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants may be affected by events beyond our control if we breach any of these restrictions or covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable this could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition

our operating results have historically varied on a quarterly basis including increased variability during the covid19 pandemic and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future for instance our businesses are seasonal in nature with the second fiscal quarter december january and february which falls during the holiday season typically generating a higher proportion of retail sales and earnings than other fiscal quarters in addition both prescription and nonprescription drug sales are affected by the timing and severity of the cough cold and flu season which can vary considerably from year to year other factors that may affect our quarterly operating results some of which are beyond the control of management include but are not limited to the impact and duration of covid19 the timing of the introduction of new generic and brand name prescription drugs inflation including with respect to generic drug procurement costs seasonality including the timing and severity of the cough cold and flu season changes or rates of change in payer reimbursement rates and terms the timing and amount of periodic contractual reconciliation payments fluctuations in inventory energy transportation labor healthcare and other costs significant acquisitions dispositions joint ventures and other strategic initiatives asset impairment charges including the performance of and impairment charges related to our equity method investments the relative magnitude of our lifo provision in any particular quarter foreign currency fluctuations market conditions widespread looting or vandalism and many of the other risk factors discussed herein accordingly we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and investors should not place undue reliance on the results of any particular quarter as an indication of our future performance 

we have a substantial amount of goodwill and other intangible assets which could in the future become impaired and result in material noncash charges to our results of operations 

as of august 31 2021 we had 124 billion of goodwill and 99 billion of other intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheets we evaluate this goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that could more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinitelived intangible asset below its carrying value as part of this impairment analysis we determine fair value for each reporting unit using both the income and market approaches we determine fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets using the relief from royalty method and excess earnings method of the income approach definitelived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable estimated fair values could change if for example there are changes in the business climate changes in the competitive environment adverse legal or regulatory actions or developments changes in capital structure cost of debt and equity capital expenditure levels operating cash flows or market capitalization whether due to covid19 or otherwise there can be no assurance that impairments will not occur and any impairment may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

we are exposed to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

we operate or have equity method investments in several countries across the globe which expose us to currency exchange rate fluctuations and related risks including transaction currency exposures relating to the import and export of goods in currencies other than businesses’ functional currencies as well as currency translation exposures relating to profits and net assets denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we present our financial statements in us dollars and have a significant proportion of net assets and income in nonus dollar currencies primarily the british pound sterling as well as a range of other foreign currencies our results of operations and capital ratios can therefore be sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future results of operations in addition fluctuations in currencies relative to the us dollar may make it more difficult to perform periodtoperiod comparisons of our reported results of operations a depreciation of nonus dollar currencies relative to the us dollar could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations 



table of con t e n t 

we may from time to time in some instances enter into foreign currency contracts or other derivative instruments intended to hedge a portion of our foreign currency fluctuation risks which subjects us to additional risks such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations to us that could materially and adversely affect us additionally we may and currently do use foreign currency debt to hedge some of our foreign currency fluctuation risks the periodic use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place we cannot assure you that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will not materially affect our consolidated financial results 

we could be adversely impacted by changes in assumptions used in calculating pension assets and liabilities 

we operate certain defined benefit pension plans in the uk which were closed to new entrants in 2010 as well as smaller plans in other jurisdictions the valuation of the pension plans’ assets and liabilities depends in part on assumptions which are primarily based on the financial markets as well as longevity and employee retention rates this valuation is particularly sensitive to material changes in the value of equity bond and other investments held by the pension plans changes in the corporate bond yields which are used in the measurement of the liabilities changes in market expectations for longterm price inflation and new evidence on projected longevity rates funding requirements and the impact on the statement of earnings relating to these pension plans are also influenced by these factors adverse changes in the assumptions used to calculate the value of pension assets and liabilities including lower than expected pension fund investment returns andor increased life expectancy of plan participants or regulatory change could require us to increase the funding of its defined benefit pension plans or incur higher expenses which would adversely impact our results of operations and financial position 

risks from changes in public policy and other legal and regulatory risks 

changes in the healthcare industry and regulatory environments may adversely affect our businesses 

political economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to significant changes that could adversely affect our results of operations in recent years the healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to reduce costs and government spending these changes include an increased reliance on managed care cuts in certain medicare and medicaid funding in the us and the funding of governmental payers in foreign jurisdictions consolidation of competitors suppliers and other market participants and the development of large sophisticated purchasing groups we expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future some of these potential changes such as a reduction in governmental funding for certain healthcare services or adverse changes in legislation or regulations governing prescription drug pricing healthcare services or mandated benefits may cause customers to reduce the amount of our products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services we expect continued governmental and private payer pressure to reduce pharmaceutical pricing and these pressures could be further exacerbated if payer deficits or shortfalls increase due to covid19 or otherwise changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers’ pricing or distribution policies and practices as well as applicable government regulations including for example in connection with the federal 340b drug pricing program could also significantly reduce our profitability 

we are exposed to risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings 

we operate in a highly regulated and litigious environment we are involved in legal proceedings including litigation arbitration and other claims and investigations inspections audits claims inquiries and similar actions by pharmacy healthcare tax and other governmental authorities including those contained in note 11 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for additional information for example in january 2019 walgreen co on behalf of itself its subsidiaries and certain identified affiliates resolved matters regarding certain dispensing practices by entering into among other things a corporate integrity agreement with the office of inspector general of the united states department of health and human services the corporate integrity agreement has a fiveyear term and provides that walgreen co shall among other things continue the compliance program it created to address compliance with federal health care program requirements provide annual certifications of compliance and provide training and education for certain covered employees failure to meet the corporate integrity agreement obligations could have material adverse consequences for us including reputational harm and monetary penalties for each instance of noncompliance in addition in the event of a breach or deliberate violation of the corporate integrity agreement we could be excluded from participation in federal healthcare programs or subjected to other significant penalties which could seriously harm our results of operations liquidity and financial results 

legal proceedings in general and securities derivative action and class action and multidistrict litigation in particular can be expensive and disruptive some of these suits may purport or may be determined to be class actions andor involve parties seeking large andor indeterminate amounts including punitive or exemplary damages and may remain unresolved for several 



table of con t e n t 

years for example we are a defendant in numerous litigation proceedings relating to opioid matters including federal multidistrict litigation that consolidated numerous cases filed against an array of defendants by various plaintiffs such as counties cities hospitals indian tribes and others as well as numerous lawsuits brought in state courts additionally the company has received from the department of justice and the attorney generals of numerous states subpoenas civil investigative demands andor other requests concerning opioid matters from time to time the company is also involved in legal proceedings as a plaintiff involving antitrust tax contract intellectual property and other matters see note 11 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 below for additional information 

the company’s financial results may also be adversely affected by the litigation and other legal proceedings of companies in which it has an equity method investment for example amerisourcebergen is involved in litigation and legal proceeding including those relating to opioid matters any unfavorable outcome or settlement related to these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results 

like other companies in the retail pharmacy and pharmaceutical wholesale industries the company is subject to extensive regulation by national state and local government agencies in the us and other countries in which it operates there continues to be a heightened level of review andor audit by regulatory authorities of and increased litigation regarding business compliance and reporting practices of the company and other industry participants as a result the company regularly is the subject of government actions of the types described above in addition under the qui tam or “whistleblower” provisions of the federal and various state false claims acts persons may bring lawsuits alleging that a violation of the federal antikickback statute or similar laws has resulted in the submission of “false” claims to federal andor state healthcare programs including medicare and medicaid after a private party has filed a qui tam action the government must investigate the private partys claim and determine whether to intervene in and take control over the litigation these actions may remain under seal while the government makes this determination 

we cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies and the costs incurred in litigation can be substantial regardless of the outcome substantial unanticipated verdicts fines and rulings do sometimes occur as a result we could from time to time incur judgments enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters and such developments could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued andor our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid in addition as a result of governmental investigations or proceedings the company may be subject to damages civil or criminal fines or penalties or other sanctions including the possible suspension or loss of licensure andor suspension or exclusion from participation in government programs the outcome of some of these legal proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could negatively affect our operations additionally defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management’s attention and resources 

a significant change in or noncompliance with governmental regulations and other legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and profitability 

we operate in complex highly regulated environments around the world and could be materially and adversely affected by changes to applicable legal requirements including the related interpretations and enforcement practices new legal requirements andor any failure to comply with applicable regulations our retail pharmacy and health and wellness services businesses are subject to numerous country state and local regulations including licensing billing practices utilization and other requirements for pharmacies and reimbursement arrangements the regulations to which we are subject include but are not limited to country and state registration and regulation of pharmacies and drug discount card programs dispensing and sale of controlled substances and products containing pseudoephedrine applicable governmental payer regulations including medicare and medicaid data privacy and security laws and regulations including hipaa the aca or any successor thereto laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters each of which continues to evolve including those governing exposure to and the management and disposal of hazardous substances regulations regarding food and drug safety including those of the us food and drug administration “fda” and drug enforcement administration “dea” trade regulations including those of the us federal trade commission and consumer protection and safety regulations including those of the consumer product safety commission as well as state regulatory authorities governing the availability sale advertisement and promotion of products we sell as well as our loyalty and drug discount card programs antikickback laws false claims laws laws against the corporate practice of medicine and foreign national and state laws governing health care fraud and abuse and the practice of the profession of pharmacy for example in the us the dea fda and various other regulatory authorities regulate the distribution and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances we are required to hold valid dea and statelevel licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with the federal and various state controlled substance acts and related regulations governing the sale dispensing disposal holding and distribution of controlled substances the dea fda and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers including 



table of con t e n t 

the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations we are also governed by foreign national and state laws of general applicability including laws regulating matters of working conditions health and safety and equal employment opportunity and other labor and employment matters as well as employee benefit competition and antitrust matters in addition we could have significant exposure if we are found to have infringed another party’s intellectual property rights 

changes in laws regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may alter the landscape in which we do business and may significantly affect our cost of doing business the impact of new laws regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices generally cannot be predicted and changes in applicable laws regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may require extensive system and operational changes be difficult to implement increase our operating costs and require significant capital expenditures untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties that could adversely affect the continued operation of our businesses including suspension of payments from government programs loss of required government certifications loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government programs including the medicare and medicaid programs in the us and the national health service in the uk loss of licenses and significant fines or monetary penalties any failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements in the us or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in significant legal and financial exposure damage to our reputation and brand and have a material adverse effect on our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

we could be adversely affected by violations of antibribery anticorruption andor international trade laws 

we are subject to laws concerning our business operations and marketing activities in foreign countries where we conduct business for example we are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” us export control antimoney laundering and economic and trade sanction laws and similar anticorruption and international trade laws in certain foreign countries such as the uk bribery act any violation of which could create substantial liability for us and also harm our reputation violations of these laws and regulations or any other antibribery anticorruption or international trade laws may subject us to penalties sanctions including civil and criminal fines disgorgement of profits and suspension or debarment of our ability to contract with governmental agencies or receive export licenses from time to time we may face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign governmental agencies relating to our international business activities compliance with which could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations an adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could damage our reputation and subject us to fines or other penalties which could materially and adversely affect our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

we could be adversely affected by product liability product recall personal injury or other health and safety issues 

we could be adversely impacted by the supply of defective or expired products including the infiltration of counterfeit products into the supply chain errors in relabeling of products product tampering product recall and contamination or product mishandling issues through our pharmacies and specialist packaging sites including through services provided by thirdparty health care providers we are also exposed to risks relating to the products and services we offer errors in the dispensing and packaging of pharmaceuticals including related counseling and in the provision of other healthcare services could lead to serious injury or death product liability or personal injury claims may be asserted against us and mandatory or voluntary product recalls may apply to us with respect to any of the retail products or pharmaceuticals we sell or services we provide particularly with regard to our private branded products that are not available from other retailers for example from time to time the fda issues statements alerting patients that products in our supply chain may contain impurities or harmful substances and claims relating to the sale or distribution of such products may be asserted against us or arise from these statements our healthcare clinics also increase our exposure to professional liability claims related to medical care we could suffer significant reputational damage and financial liability if we or any affiliated entities or thirdparty healthcare providers that we do business with experience any of the foregoing health and safety issues or incidents which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

we could be subject to adverse changes in tax laws regulations and interpretations or challenges to our tax positions 

as a large corporation with operations in the us and numerous other jurisdictions from time to time changes in tax laws or regulations may be proposed or enacted that could adversely affect our overall tax liability for example the us tax legislation enacted in december 2017 represented a significant overhaul of the us federal tax code that impacted our us federal income tax position there can be no assurance that changes in tax laws or regulations both within the us and the other jurisdictions in which we operate will not materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate tax payments financial condition and results 



table of con t e n t 

of operations similarly changes in tax laws and regulations that impact our customers and counterparties or the economy generally may also impact our financial condition and results of operations 

tax laws and regulations are complex and subject to varying interpretations and we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative impact on our effective tax rate tax payments financial condition and results of operations in addition the determination of our income tax provision and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain the ultimate tax determination may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our results of operations in the period or periods for which such determination is made any significant failure to comply with applicable tax laws and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions could give rise to substantial penalties and liabilities any changes in enacted tax laws such as the recent us tax legislation rules or regulatory or judicial interpretations or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could materially and adversely impact our effective tax rate tax payments financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to our structure and organization 

certain stockholders may have significant voting influence over matters requiring stockholder approval 

as of august 31 stefano pessina our executive chairman together with his affiliates the “sp investors” had sole or shared voting power directly or indirectly over an aggregate of approximately 169 of our outstanding common stock the sp investors have agreed to for so long as they have the right to designate a nominee for election to the board to vote all of their shares of common stock in accordance with the board’s recommendation on matters submitted to a vote of the company’s stockholders including with respect to the election of directors the sp investors’ significant interest in our common stock potentially could determine the outcome of matters submitted to a vote by our stockholders the influence of the sp investors could result in the company taking actions that other stockholders do not support or failing to take actions that other stockholders support in addition issuances or sales of our common stock or the exercise of related registration rights including sales of shares by our directors and officers or key investors including the sp investors and certain other former alliance boots stockholders are subject to restrictions in the case of shares held by persons deemed to be our affiliates and to certain obligations pursuant to the company shareholders agreement as defined herein as a result the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected 

conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest may arise because certain of our directors and officers are also owners or directors of companies we may have dealings with 

conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest could arise between our interests and the interests of the other entities and business activities in which our directors or officers are involved for example potential conflicts of interest could arise if a dispute were to arise between the company and other parties to the shareholders agreement the “company shareholders agreement” with certain sp investors mr pessina our executive chairman indirectly controls alliance santé participations sa “asp” a privatelyheld company which is a party to the company shareholders agreement and he and his partner ornella barra our chief operating officer international serve as directors of asp there are other arrangements between affiliates of mr pessina and the company with required disclosures included in the company’s annual proxy statement including with respect to alliance healthcare italia spa which is an entity indirectly owned and controlled by mr pessina and in which the company has an indirect 9 interest which operates boots branded stores in italy conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest or similar issues could arise in connection with these or other transactions in the future while our contractual arrangements place restrictions on the parties’ conduct in certain situations and related party transactions are subject to independent review and approval in accordance with our related party transactions approval procedures and applicable law the potential for a conflict of interest exists and such persons may have conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting both companies 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws delaware law or our agreements with certain stockholders may impede the ability of our stockholders to make changes to our board or impede a takeover 

certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as provisions of the delaware general corporation law the “dgcl” could make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the board or discourage delay or prevent a merger consolidation or acquisitions that stockholders may otherwise consider favorable these provisions include the authorization of the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that could be issued by the board limitations on the ability of stockholders to call special meetings and advance notice requirements for nomination for election to the board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings we are also subject to the provisions of section 203 of

while these provisions do not make us immune from takeovers or changes in the composition of the board and are intended to protect our stockholders from among other things coercive or otherwise unfair tactics these provisions could have the effect of making it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the board or discouraging delaying or preventing a merger consolidation or acquisitions that stockholders may otherwise consider favorable

factors trends and uncertainties affecting our results and comparability 

the company has been and we expect it to continue to be affected by a number of factors that may cause actual results to differ from our historical results or current expectations these factors include the impact of the covid19 pandemic “covid19” on our operations and financial results the financial performance of our equity method investees including amerisourcebergen the influence of certain holidays seasonality foreign currency rates changes in vendor payer and customer relationships and terms and associated reimbursement pressure strategic transactions and acquisitions dispositions joint ventures and other strategic collaborations changes in laws including us tax law changes changes in trade tariffs including trade relations between the us and china and international relations including the uks withdrawal from the european union and its impact on our operations and prospects and those of our customers and counterparties the timing and magnitude of cost reduction initiatives including under our transformational cost management program as defined below the timing and severity of the cough cold and flu season fluctuations in variable costs the impacts of looting natural disasters war terrorism and other catastrophic events and changes in general economic conditions in the markets in which the company operates 

specialty pharmacy represents a significant and growing proportion of prescription drug spending in the us a significant portion of which is dispensed outside of traditional retail pharmacies to better serve the evolving specialty pharmacy market in march 2017 we and prime therapeutics llc a pbm closed a transaction to form a combined central specialty pharmacy and mail services company alliancerx walgreens prime using an innovative model that seeks to align pharmacy pbm and health plans to coordinate patient care improve health outcomes and deliver cost of care opportunities certain clients of our joint venture were and are not obligated to contract through our joint venture and have in the past and may in the future enter into specialty pharmacy and other agreements without involving our joint venture over the last year certain clients have chosen not to renew their contracts through our joint venture which will impact gross sales however considering the relatively low margin nature of this business we do not anticipate this having a material impact on operating income 

these and other factors can affect the company’s operations and net earnings for any period and may cause such results not to be comparable to the same period in previous years the results presented in this report are not necessarily indicative of future operating results 

covid19 

covid19 has severely impacted and may continue to impact the economies of the us the uk and other countries around the world covid19 has created significant public health concerns as well as significant volatility uncertainty and economic disruption in every region in which we operate which has adversely affected and may again adversely affect our industries and our business operations further financial and credit markets experienced and may again experience volatility policies and initiatives designed to reduce the transmission of covid19 have resulted in among other things temporary closure or reduced hours of operation of certain store locations in the us the uk and other countries reduced customer traffic and sales in our retail pharmacies and the adoption of workfromhome policies 



table of con t e n t 

in response to covid19 various domestic and foreign federal state and local governmental legislation regulations orders policies and initiatives have been implemented that are designed to reduce the transmission of covid19 as well as to help address economic and market volatility and instability resulting from covid19 the company has assessed and will continue to assess the impact of these governmental actions on the company the company has participated in certain of these programs including for example availing itself to certain tax deferrals which were introduced by the cares act in the us and certain tax deferral and benefit and employee wage support in the uk and if available may continue to do so in the future 

during the first half of fiscal 2021 the company experienced certain adverse impacts of covid19 sales were negatively impacted within the united states segment driven by low level of flu incidences as social distancing measures continued to remain in place across the us sales were also negatively impacted within the international segment which reflected a reduction in footfall in boots uk stores as a second national lockdown was declared in november 2020 the company took measures to keep stores open incurring incremental selling general and administrative expenses including higher employee costs and store expenses related to social distancing and incremental cleaning covid19 drivethrough testing sites expenses safeguarding store environments as well as preparing for the rollout of mass vaccinations in the beginning of fiscal 2021 the company also took certain actions to partly mitigate the impact of covid19 through cost containment across the company including temporary store closures and decreasing store hours and reducing rent at some locations the companys operating income was significantly and adversely impacted during the first half of fiscal 2021 as a result of covid19 

during the second half of fiscal 2021 the company experienced sequential improvement compared to the first half of fiscal 2021 as sales and comparable scripts were positively impacted within the united states segment due to the acceleration of covid19 vaccination rollout and a recovery in retail the united states segment’s operating income was also positively impacted as a result of covid19 vaccines administered net of incremental labor and other costs related to the vaccination program the international segment experienced a rebound in retail sales and operating income during the second half of fiscal 2021 resulting from the phased reopening of the uk high street and less severe covid19 restrictions however despite these improvements during the second half of fiscal 2021 store footfall in the uk remained below precovid19 levels 

the company has taken a number of proactive actions consistent with regulatory directives such as digital order ahead drivethrough offering services with an increased range of products available for drivethrough pickup and curbside collection and put in place new delivery options available nationwide in the us during fiscal 2021 to continue to work with customers and manage operations through the pandemic the company launched a new covid19 testing program for businesses in fiscal 2020 as of august 31 2021 the company has administered 129 million covid19 tests in the us as part of its test  protect efforts in the international segment boots administered more than 37 million covid19 tests in the uk mostly undertaken in partnership with the national health service “nhs” boots uk has a growing private test offering with several at home and instore tests available in addition to testing partnerships with several major airlines 

the company has worked with the centers for disease control and prevention “cdc” us department of health and human services “hhs” and the us government to help administer covid19 vaccines to high priority groups including longterm care facility residents and staff the united states segment also expanded vaccination models to ensure convenient access including sameday and walkin appointments mobile clinics employer partnerships and extended hours as of august 31 2021 the united states segment had administered approximately 346 million covid19 vaccinations including 135 million in the three months ended august 31 2021 

the situation surrounding covid19 remains fluid and could result in additional mandates and directives including revisions thereto from foreign federal state county and city authorities throughout the continuation of the covid19 pandemic and for some time thereafter the impact on the us and global economies and consumer customer and health care utilization patterns depends upon the evolving factors and future developments related to covid19 as a result the financial andor operational impact on the company operating results cash flows andor financial condition is uncertain but the impact singularly or collectively could be material and adverse 

the company’s current expectations described above are forwardlooking statements and our actual results may differ factors that might cause a difference include but are not limited to those discussed below under “cautionary note regarding forwardlooking statements” and in item 1a risk factors

critical accounting estimates 

the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and include amounts based on management’s prudent judgments and estimates actual results may differ from these estimates management believes that any reasonable deviation from those judgments and estimates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations to the extent that the estimates used differ from actual results however adjustments to the consolidated statements of earnings and corresponding consolidated balance sheets accounts would be necessary these adjustments would be made in future periods some of the more significant estimates include business combinations leases goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment longlived assets impairment cost of sales and inventory equity method investments pension and postretirement benefits and income taxes the company uses the following methods to determine its estimates 

  

business combinations – the company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that once control is obtained all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition the determination of fair values of assets and liabilities acquired requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available 

for intangible assets the company generally uses the income approach to determine fair value the income approach requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions primarily include but are not limited to discount rates terminal growth rates royalty rates forecasts of revenue operating income depreciation amortization and capital expenditures the discount rates applied to the projections reflect the risk factors associated with those projections 

although the company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates changes in assumptions concerning future 



table of con t e n t 

financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on the determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired 

judgment is also required in determining the intangible asset’s useful life 

leases  the company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at the inception of a contract the lease classification is determined at the commencement date rightofuse assets represent the company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease during the lease term rightofuse assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of the remaining future minimum lease payments during the lease term lease commencement is the date the company has the right to control the property the company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments the incremental borrowing rate is based on the companys estimated rate of interest for a collateralized borrowing over a similar term as the lease term the operating lease rightofuse assets also include lease payments made before commencement lease incentives and are recorded net of impairment operating leases are expensed on a straight line basis over the lease term 

the lease term of real estate leases includes renewal options that are reasonably certain of being exercised options to extend are considered reasonably certain of being exercised based on evaluation if there are significant investments within the leased property which have useful lives greater than the noncancelable lease term performance of the underlying store and the company’s economic and strategic initiatives shortterm leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheets 

the company accounts for lease components and nonlease components as a single lease component variable lease payment amounts that cannot be determined at the commencement of the lease such as increases in lease payments based on changes in index rates or usage are not included in the rightofuse assets or lease liabilities these are expensed as incurred the company has real estate leases which require additional payments based on sales volume as well as reimbursement for real estate taxes common area maintenance and insurance which are expensed as incurred as variable lease costs and hence are not included in the lease payments used to calculate lease liability other real estate leases contain one fixed lease payment that includes real estate taxes common area maintenance and insurance these fixed payments are considered part of the lease payment and included in the rightofuse assets and lease liabilities the company does not separately account for the land portion of the leases involving land and building 

finance leases are recognized within property plant and equipment and as a finance lease liability within accrued expenses and other liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment – goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that could more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or intangible asset below its carrying value as part of the company’s impairment analysis fair value of a reporting unit is determined using both the income and market approaches the income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit including projected future operating results economic projections anticipated future cash flows and discount rates the market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping 

indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value indefinitelived intangible assets fair values are estimated using the relief from royalty method and excess earnings method of the income approach the determination of the fair value of the indefinitelived intangibles requires the company to make significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions primarily include but are not limited to forecasts of revenue the selection of appropriate royalty rate and discount rates 

the determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires the company to make significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the business and financial performance of the company’s reporting units as well as how such performance may be impacted by covid19 these estimates and assumptions primarily include but are not limited to the selection of appropriate peer group companies control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we compete discount rates terminal growth rates forecasts of revenue operating income depreciation amortization and capital expenditures including considering the impact of covid19 

although the company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions including the impact of covid19 could have a significant impact on either 



table of con t e n t 

the fair value of the reporting units and indefinitelived intangibles the amount of any goodwill and indefinitelived intangible impairment charges or both these estimates can be affected by a number of factors including but not limited to the impact of covid19 its severity duration and its impact on global economies general economic conditions as well as our profitability the company will continue to monitor these potential impacts including the impact of covid19 and economic industry and market trends and the impact these may have on boots and other international reporting units 

the company also compares the sum of estimated fair values of reporting units to the company’s fair value as implied by the market value of its equity securities this comparison provides an indication that in total assumptions and estimates are reasonable future declines in the overall market value of the company’s equity securities may provide an indication that the fair value of one or more reporting units has declined below its carrying value 

see note 7 goodwill and other intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for additional information 

impairment of long lived assets  the company evaluates the recoverability of longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such an asset may not be recoverable the evaluation of longlived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows longlived assets related to the company’s retail operations include property plant and equipment definitelived intangibles right of use asset as well as operating lease liability if the asset group fails the recoverability test then an impairment charge is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the asset group compared to its carrying value fair value of the asset group is generally determined using income approach based on cash flows expected from the use and eventual disposal of the asset group 

the determination of the fair value of the asset group requires management to estimate a number of factors including anticipated future cash flows and discount rates although we believe these estimates are reasonable actual results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates 

cost of sales and inventory – cost of sales includes the purchase price of goods and cost of services rendered store and warehouse inventory loss inventory obsolescence and supplier rebates in addition to product costs cost of sales includes warehousing costs for retail operations purchasing costs freight costs cash discounts and vendor allowances 

cost of sales is derived based upon pointofsale scanning information with an estimate for shrinkage and is adjusted based on periodic inventory counts inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market determined by the lastin firstout “lifo” method for the united states segment and on an average cost and firstin firstout “fifo” basis for inventory in the international segment 

  

equity method investments   – the company uses the equity method of accounting for equity investments if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence but not control over operating and financial policies of the investee the company’s proportionate share of the net income or loss of these investees is included in consolidated net earnings judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as the company’s ownership interest legal form of the investee eg limited liability partnership representation on the board of directors participation in policymaking decisions and material intraentity transactions 

the company evaluates equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable factors considered by the company when reviewing an equity method investment for impairment include the length of time duration and the extent severity to which the fair value of the equity method investment has been less than cost the investee’s financial condition and nearterm prospects and the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery an impairment that is otherthantemporary is recognized in the period identified 

  

pension and postretirement benefits – the company has various defined benefit pension plans that cover some of its nonus employees the company also has a postretirement healthcare plan that covers qualifying us employees eligibility and the level of benefits for these plans vary depending on participants’ status date of hire and or length of service pension and postretirement healthcare plan expenses and valuations are dependent on assumptions used by thirdparty actuaries in calculating those amounts these assumptions include discount rates healthcare cost trends longterm return on plan assets retirement rates mortality rates and other factors 

in determining longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption the company considers both the historical performance of the investment portfolio as well as the longterm market return expectations based on the investment mix of the portfolio a change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on its pension expense a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate 



table of con t e n t 

would result in a decline of 443 million to the company’s pension benefit obligation a 25 basis point decrease on the expected return on plan assets assumption would increase the company’s pension expense by 26 million 

the company funds its pension plans in accordance with applicable regulations the postretirement healthcare plan is not funded 

  

income taxes –the company is subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business us federal state local and foreign tax authorities raise questions regarding the company’s tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions in evaluating the tax benefits associated with the various tax filing positions the company records a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized adjustments are made to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which the company determines the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities the statute of limitations expires for the return containing the tax position or when more information becomes available the liability for unrecognized tax benefits including accrued penalties and interest is primarily included in other noncurrent liabilities and current income taxes on the company’s consolidated balance sheets and in income tax provision in its consolidated statements of earnings 

  

in determining its provision for income taxes the company uses income permanent differences between book and tax income and enacted statutory income tax rates the provision for income taxes rate also reflects its assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits in addition to any foreignbased income deemed to be taxable in the us discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

interest rate risk 

the company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to existing variablerate debt instruments and future incurrences of fixed or variablerate debt which exposure primarily relates to movements in various interest rates such as us treasury rates and commercial paper rates from time to time the company uses interest rate swaps and forwardstarting interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to the impact of interest rate changes on existing debt and future debt issuances respectively to reduce the volatility of financing costs and based on current and projected market conditions achieve a desired proportion of fixedrate versus floatingrate debt generally under these swaps the company agrees with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixedrate and floatingrate interest amounts based on an agreed upon notional principal amount 

on march 5 2021 the uk financial conduct authority the “fca” which regulates the london interbank offered rate or libor issued an announcement on the future cessation or loss of representativeness of libor benchmark settings currently

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily with respect to the british pound sterling and certain other foreign currencies which may affect its net investment in foreign subsidiaries and may cause fluctuations in cash flows related to foreign denominated transactions the company is also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the us dollar the company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on nonfunctional currency cash flows these transactions are almost exclusively less than 12 months in maturity in addition the company enters into foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated in hedging relationships to offset in part the impacts of certain intercompany activities primarily associated with intercompany financing transactions 

the company’s foreign currency derivative instruments are sensitive to changes in exchange rates a hypothetical 1 change in foreign currency exchange rates versus the us dollar would change the fair value of the foreign currency derivatives held as of august 31 2021 by approximately 53 million the foreign currency derivatives are intended to partially hedge anticipated transactions foreign currency trade payables and receivables and net investments in foreign subsidiaries

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting and the report of deloitte  touche llp the company’s independent registered public accounting firm related to their assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting are included in part ii item 8 of this form 10k and are incorporated in this item 9a by reference 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

in the ordinary course of business the company reviews its internal control over financial reporting and makes changes to its systems and processes that are intended to enhance such controls and increase efficiency while maintaining an effective internal control environment changes may include such activities as updating existing systems automating manual processes standardizing controls and modifying monitoring controls 

as we transform our business processes we continue to make strategic changes in how we perform certain key business functions these changes include the continued leveraging of extended workforces via thirdparty outsource arrangements as well as our continued implementation of new information systems these initiatives are not being implemented in response to any identified internal control deficiency or weakness as these changes occur we will evaluate quarterly whether such changes materially affect or are reasonably likely to materially affect the companys internal control over financial reporting 

in connection with the evaluation pursuant to exchange act rule 13a15d of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rule 13a15f by the company’s management including its ceo and cfo no changes during the quarter ended august 31 2021 were identified that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

our management including the ceo and cfo do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of controls 



effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures

industry overview 

the retail pharmacy and pharmaceutical wholesale industries across the globe are highly competitive and dynamic and have experienced consolidation and an evolving competitive landscape in recent years prescription drugs play a significant role in healthcare and constitute a first line of treatment for many medical conditions the company believes the longterm outlook for prescription drug utilization is strong due in part to aging populations increases in life expectancy increases in the availability of generic drugs the continued development of innovative drugs that improve quality of life and control healthcare costs and increases in the number of persons with insurance coverage for prescription drugs including in the united states “baby boomers” increasingly becoming eligible for the federally funded medicare part d prescription program pharmaceutical wholesalers act as a vital link between drug manufacturers and pharmacies and healthcare providers in supplying pharmaceuticals to patients 

the retail pharmacy industry across the globe relies significantly on private and governmental thirdparty payers many private organizations throughout the healthcare industry including pharmacy benefit management “pbm” companies and health insurance companies have consolidated in recent years to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater bargaining power thirdparty payers including the medicare part d plans and the statesponsored medicaid and related managed care medicaid agencies in the united states can change eligibility requirements or reduce certain reimbursement rates in addition in many european countries the government provides or subsidizes healthcare to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices patient eligibility and reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored healthcare system changes in law or regulation also can impact reimbursement rates and terms for example the patient protection and affordable care act the “aca” was enacted to help control federal healthcare spending including for prescription drugs in the united states these changes generally are expected to reduce medicaid reimbursements in the united states state medicaid programs are also expected to continue to seek reductions in reimbursements when thirdparty payers or governmental authorities take actions that restrict eligibility or reduce prices or reimbursement rates sales and margins in the retail pharmacy industry could be reduced which would adversely affect industry profitability in some cases these possible adverse effects may be partially or entirely offset by controlling inventory costs and other expenses dispensing more higher margin generics finding new revenue streams through pharmacy services or other offerings andor dispensing a greater volume of prescriptions 

these industry dynamics and challenges are continuous and have intensified in recent years since the completion of the strategic combination with alliance boots in december 2014 the company has had a continuous focus on operational efficiencies and cost reduction 

generic prescription drugs have continued to help lower overall costs for customers and thirdparty payers the company expects the utilization of generic pharmaceuticals to continue to increase in general in the united states generic versions of drugs generate lower sales dollars per prescription but higher gross profit dollars as compared with patentprotected brand name drugs the impact on retail pharmacy gross profit dollars can be significant in the first several months after a generic version of a drug is first allowed to compete with the branded version which is generally referred to as a “generic conversion” in any given year the number of major brand name drugs that undergo a conversion from branded to generic status can vary and the timing of generic conversions can be difficult to predict which can have a significant impact on retail pharmacy sales 

 3  

and gross profit dollars in general in the united states specialty prescription business is also growing and generates higher sales dollars per prescription but lower gross margin as compared to generic prescription drugs 

the company expects that market demand government regulation thirdparty reimbursement policies government contracting requirements and other pressures will continue to cause the industries in which the company competes to evolve pharmacists are on the frontlines of the healthcare delivery system and the company believes rising healthcare costs and the limited supply of primary care physicians present opportunities for pharmacists and retail pharmacies to play an even greater role in driving positive outcomes for patients and payers through expanded service offerings

the components of the division’s sales are pharmacy the sale of prescription drugs and provision of pharmacyrelated services and retail the sale of healthcare and retail products including nonprescription drugs health and wellness beauty and 

 4  

personal care and consumables and general merchandise the division’s sales are subject to the influence of seasonality particularly the cough cold and flu seasons and winter holiday this seasonality also can affect the division’s proportion of sales between retail and pharmacy during certain periods the components of the division’s fiscal year sales were as follows 



the company filled 8180 million prescriptions including immunizations in the division in fiscal 2020 adjusted to 30day equivalents prescriptions filled were 12 billion in fiscal 2020 the company fills prescriptions under medicare medicaid and other publicly financed or sponsored health benefit and prescription drug plans and programs including the federal 340b drug pricing program sales where reimbursement is received from managed care organizations governmental agencies pbm companies and private insurance were approximately 97 of the division’s fiscal 2020 pharmacy sales 

the company fills prescriptions for many state medicaid public assistance programs sales from all such medicaid plans were approximately 4 of the division’s fiscal 2020 sales sales from medicare part d plans were approximately 20 of the division’s fiscal 2020 sales

amerisourcebergen supplies and distributes a significant amount of generic and branded pharmaceutical products to the division’s pharmacies the company purchases its nonpharmaceutical merchandise from numerous manufacturers and wholesalers 

the division’s sales gross profit margin and gross profit are impacted by among other things both the percentage of prescriptions filled that are generic and the rate at which new generic drugs are introduced to the market because any number of factors outside of the company’s control can affect timing for a generic conversion the company faces substantial uncertainty in predicting when such conversions will occur and what effect they will have on particular future periods 

the current environment of the company’s pharmacy business also includes ongoing reimbursement pressure and a shift in pharmacy mix towards 90day at retail one prescription that is the equivalent of three 30day prescriptions and medicare part d prescriptions further consolidation among generic manufacturers coupled with changes in the number of major brand name drugs anticipated to undergo a conversion from branded to generic status may also result in gross margin pressures within the industry 

the company continuously faces reimbursement pressure from pbm companies government health maintenance organizations managed care organizations and other commercial thirdparty payers agreements with these payers are regularly subject to expiration termination or renegotiation in addition plan changes with rate adjustments often occur in january and the company’s reimbursement arrangements may provide for rate adjustments at prescribed intervals during their term the company experienced lower reimbursement rates in fiscal 2020 as compared to the same period in the prior year the company expects these pressures to continue 

the company has also worked to develop and expand its relationships with commercial thirdparty payers to enable new andor improved market access via participation in pharmacy provider networks they offer the prescription volume impact of new agreements and relationships typically is incremental over time 

the company’s 90day at retail prescription drug offering is typically at a lower margin than comparable 30day prescriptions but provides the company with the opportunity to increase business with patients with chronic prescription needs while offering increased convenience helping facilitate improved prescription adherence and resulting in a lower cost to fill the 90day prescription similarly the growing specialty prescription business which generates higher sales dollars per prescription 

 5  

may result in gross margin pressures within the industry as compared to generic prescription drugs the division’s performance is also impacted by the current environment including the uncertainty as a result of covid19 for more information see risk factors in item 1a below

the components of the division’s sales are pharmacy typically the sale of prescription drugs and provision of pharmacyrelated services subject to variation in particular jurisdictions depending upon regulatory and other factors and retail primarily the sale of health and beauty products including beauty toiletries and lifestyle merchandising nonprescription drugs and in the united kingdom the provision of optical services 

the division’s sales are subject to the influence of seasonality with the second fiscal quarter typically the strongest as a result of the winter holiday period this seasonality affects the division’s proportion of sales between retail and pharmacy during certain periods the components of the division’s fiscal year sales were as follows 



the division’s retail sales gross profit margin and gross profit dollars are impacted by among other things the highly competitive nature of the health and beauty category specifically the company and its competitors’ pricing actions promotional offers and events and the customer’s desire for value and convenience

the division’s sales gross profit margin and gross profit dollars are impacted by among other things government actions which typically seek to reduce the growth in prescription drug consumption reduce reimbursement rates and increase generic drug utilization a greater proportion of generic drugs whether as a result of government actions generic conversions or other factors typically has an adverse effect on the company’s revenues however in the wholesale division the company typically earns equal or better gross margins on generic drugs than on branded drugs although there are exceptions 

changes in manufacturers’ product distribution business models can also impact the division’s sales and gross margin for example when pharmaceutical drug manufacturers introduce feeforservice contracts the company’s sales are reduced even if it is successful in winning these contracts as the company only recognizes sales for the amount of the fees charged other manufacturer services including prewholesale and contract logistics operations are typically on a feeforservice basis

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information in this report and our other filings with the sec you should carefully consider the risks described below which could materially and adversely affect our business operations financial condition and results of operations covid19 amplifies and exacerbates many of the risks we face in our business operations including those discussed below these risks are not the only risks that we face our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial 

our business operations results of operations cash flows and financial position have been and will in the future be adversely impacted by covid19 and the duration and extent to which it will impact our business operations results of operations cash flows and financial position remains uncertain 

in december 2019 a novel strain of coronavirus which causes the infectious disease known as covid19 was reported the world health organization declared covid19 a public health emergency of international concern on january 30 2020 and a global pandemic on march 11 2020 covid19 has severely impacted and is expected to continue to severely impact the economies of the us the uk and other countries around the world covid19 has created significant public health concerns as well as significant volatility uncertainty and economic disruption in every region in which we operate all of which have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our industries and our business operations while we have taken numerous steps intended to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on us there can be no assurance that such steps will be successful or that our business operations results of operations cash flows and financial position will not be materially and adversely affected by the consequences of the pandemic 

the extent to which covid19 impacts us will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments that we are not able to predict or control including but not limited to 

• the severity and duration of the pandemic including whether there are additional waves” or other additional periods of increases or spikes in the number of covid19 cases in areas in which we operate 

• the duration degree and effectiveness of governmental business or other actions in response to the pandemic including but not limited to quarantine shelterinplace social distancing and facemask measures restrictions on or changes to our operations up to and including complete or partial closure of our stores facilities and distribution centers economic measures access to unemployment compensation stimulus payments and other fiscal policy changes or additional measures that may not yet be effected 

• the timing and availability of and prevalence of access to and utilization of effective medical treatments and vaccines for covid19 

• changes in the timing and extent of restrictions impacting our businesses and our customers as a result of covid19 which may vary materially over time and among the different regions and markets we serve 

• evolving macroeconomic factors including general economic uncertainty unemployment rates and recessionary pressures 

• the impact of the pandemic on economic activity and the pace and extent of recovery when the pandemic subsides which may vary materially over time and among the different regions and markets we serve 

• the extent and duration of the effect on consumer confidence economic wellbeing spending customer demand buying patterns and shopping behaviors including spend on discretionary categories which often include higher margin products and increased utilization of online sales channels both during and after the pandemic 

• the health of and the effect on our team members and our ability to meet staffing needs in our stores distribution facilities wholesale operations corporate offices and other critical functions including if team members are quarantined as a result of exposure 

• the impacts  financial operational and otherwise  on our distribution channels and supply chain including manufacturers and suppliers of products we sell and logistics and transportation providers and on our other strategic 

 9  

partners and service providers including the ability of these third parties to pay amounts owed to us timely or in full or to remain in business 

• consequences on our business performance and strategic initiatives stemming from the substantial investment of time and other resources to the pandemic response 

• the incremental costs of doing business during andor after the pandemic 

• volatility or disruptions in the credit and financial markets during andor after the pandemic 

• any impairment in value of our tangible or intangible assets which could be recorded as a result of a weaker economic conditions 

• the potential effects on our internal controls including those over financial reporting as a result of changes in working environments such as shelterinplace and similar orders that are applicable to our team members and business partners among others 

• changes to and modifications of business practices and internal policies and procedures including in response to regulatory changes as a result of covid19 

• increased cyber security risks including as a result of our team members and employees of our business partners vendors suppliers and other third parties with which we do business working remotely 

• the impact of regulatory and judicial changes in liability for workers compensation and potential increases in insurance costs medical claims costs and workers’ compensation claim costs  

• the impact of litigation or claims from customers employees suppliers regulators or other third parties relating to covid19 or our actions in response thereto 

• the potential reputational harm to our brands if we fail to appropriately respond or are perceived to have inadequately responded to risks relating to covid19 

• the rapidly changing and fluid circumstances caused by the pandemic and our ability to respond quickly or appropriately to those circumstances and 

• the longterm impacts of the pandemic on the global economy trade relations consumer behavior our industry and our business operations 

the above factors and uncertainties or others of which we are not currently aware may result in material adverse impacts to our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition in addition we cannot predict with certainty the impact that covid19 will have on our customers suppliers vendors and other business partners and each of their financial conditions however any material adverse effect on these parties could materially and adversely impact us 

we have incurred and continue to incur additional costs related to efforts to protect the health and wellbeing and meet the needs of our customers and team members including expanding the use of drivethru locations in the united states providing additional cleaning materials for our stores and other facilities and focusing on home delivery and digital services to connect with our customers in addition we have enhanced certain employee benefits we expect to continue to incur additional costs which may be significant as we continue to respond to this pandemic covid19 has also caused supply chain disruption which has resulted and may continue to result in higher supply chain costs to replenish inventory in our stores and distribution centers furthermore while we have significantly increased our purchases across many key categories we may face delays or difficulty sourcing certain products which could negatively impact us 

further our management remains focused on mitigating covid19 which has required and will continue to require a substantial investment of time and resources across our enterprise and could delay other value added services for example during the second half of fiscal 2020 we temporarily refocused certain resources from our transformational cost management program to work on covid19 impacts delayed the roll out of certain growth initiatives and selectively delayed investments in certain planned initiatives additionally many of our employees transitioned to remote working arrangements as a result of the pandemic which amplified our already extensive reliance on computer systems and our continued need for unimpeded access to the internet to use those systems the increase in remote work arrangements has increased certain operational risks including but not limited to cybersecurity risks and could adversely affect our ability to manage our business we have also modified other parts of our operations during the pandemic including changes in the manner in which team members interact with customers and each other adjusting our instore returns process establishing protocols for customer traffic reducing store hours and in some locations other restrictions or modifications on our operations due to emergency state or local restrictions or their effects there can be no assurance that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the pandemic and implementation of such measures have adversely affected and may continue to negatively affect the customer experience sales and our results from operations 

the impact of covid19 may also exacerbate other risks discussed herein including but not limited to those related to consumer behavior and expectations competition brand reputation implementation of strategic initiatives cybersecurity threats technology systems disruption supply chain disruptions labor availability litigation and legal proceedings and 

 10  

regulatory requirements and proceedings any of which could have a material adverse effect on us this situation is changing rapidly and additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently 

reductions in thirdparty reimbursement levels from private or governmental agency plans and potential changes in industry pricing benchmarks for prescription drugs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

the substantial majority of the prescriptions we fill are reimbursed by thirdparty payers including private and governmental agency payers the continued efforts of health maintenance organizations managed care organizations pbm companies governmental agencies and other thirdparty payers to reduce prescription drug costs and pharmacy reimbursement rates as well as litigation and other legal proceedings relating to how drugs are priced may adversely impact our results of operations in the united states plan changes with rate adjustments often occur in january and our reimbursement arrangements may provide for rate adjustments at prescribed intervals during their term in addition the timing and amount of periodic contractual reconciliations payments can vary significantly and may not follow a predictable path further in an environment where some pbm clients utilize narrow or restricted pharmacy provider networks some of these entities may offer pricing terms that we may not be willing to accept or otherwise restrict our participation in their networks of pharmacy providers 

changes in political economic and regulatory influences also may significantly affect healthcare financing and prescription drug reimbursement practices in the united states for example there have been multiple attempts through executive action legislative action and legal challenges to modify or repeal healthcare legislation along with additional initiatives focused on increasing transparency and reducing costs in the us healthcare system we cannot predict whether current or future efforts to modify or repeal these laws will be successful nor can we predict the impact that such a modification or repeal and any subsequent legislation would have on our business and reimbursement levels there have also been a number of other proposals and enactments by the federal government and various states to reduce medicare part d and medicaid reimbursement levels in response to budget deficits and we expect additional proposals in the future in the event that a thirdparty payer’s budgetary or financial condition deteriorates they may not be able to pay timely or may delay payment of amounts owed to us there can be no assurance that recent or future changes in prescription drug reimbursement policies and practices will not materially and adversely affect our results of operations in many countries where we have operations the government provides or subsidizes healthcare to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices patient eligibility and reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored healthcare system efforts to control healthcare costs including prescription drug costs are continuous and reductions in thirdparty reimbursement levels could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

in addition many payers in the united states are increasingly considering new metrics as the basis for reimbursement rates it is possible that the pharmaceutical industry or regulators may evaluate andor develop an alternative pricing reference to replace average wholesale price which is the pricing reference used for many of our contracts in addition many state medicaid feeforservice programs have established pharmacy network payments on the basis of actual acquisition cost which could have an impact on reimbursement practices in other commercial and governmental arrangements future changes to the pricing benchmarks used to establish pharmaceutical pricing including changes in the basis for calculating reimbursement by thirdparty payers could adversely affect us 

a shift in pharmacy mix toward lower margin plans products and programs could adversely affect our results of operations 

our retail pharmacy usa division seeks to grow prescription volume while operating in a marketplace with continuous reimbursement pressure a shift in the mix of pharmacy prescription volume towards programs offering lower reimbursement rates could adversely affect our results of operations for example our retail pharmacy usa division has experienced a shift in pharmacy mix towards 90day at retail in recent years and more recently during the covid19 pandemic and specialty pharmacy represents a significant and growing proportion of prescription drug spending in the united states and a larger proportion of our revenues our 90day at retail offering for patients with chronic prescription needs typically is at a lower margin than comparable 30day prescriptions and specialty pharmacy sales are generally also lower margin our retail pharmacy usa division also has experienced a shift in pharmacy mix towards medicare part d prescriptions in recent years and that trend may continue preferred medicare part d networks have increased in number in recent years however we do not participate in all such networks we have accepted market competitive reimbursement rates in order to secure preferred relationships with medicare part d plans serving senior patients with significant pharmacy needs we also have worked to develop and expand our relationships with commercial thirdparty payers to enable new andor improved market access via participation in the pharmacy provider networks they offer if we are not able to generate additional prescription volume and other business from patients participating in these programs that is sufficient to offset the impact of lower reimbursement or if the degree or terms of our participation in such preferred networks declines from current levels in future years our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 11  

we derive a significant portion of our sales in the united states from prescription drug sales reimbursed by a limited number of pharmacy benefit management companies 

we derive a significant portion of our sales in the united states from prescription drug sales reimbursed through prescription drug plans administered by a limited number of pbm companies pbm companies typically administer multiple prescription drug plans that expire at various times and provide for varying reimbursement rates and often limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list known as a formulary which might not include all of the approved drugs for a particular indication changes in pricing and other terms of our contracts with pbm companies can significantly impact our results of operations there can be no assurance that we will continue to participate in any particular pbm company’s pharmacy provider network in any particular future time period or on terms reasonably acceptable to us if our participation in the pharmacy provider network for a prescription drug plan administered by one or more of the large pbm companies is restricted or terminated we expect that our sales would be adversely affected at least in the shortterm if we are unable to replace any such lost sales either through an increase in other sales or through a resumption of participation in those plans our operating results could be materially and adversely affected if we exit a pharmacy provider network and later resume participation there can be no assurance that we will achieve any particular level of business on any particular pace or that all clients of the pbm company will choose to include us again in the pharmacy network for their plans initially or at all in addition in such circumstances we may incur increased marketing and other costs in connection with initiatives to regain former patients and attract new patients covered by such plans 

we face significant competition in attracting and retaining talented employees successfully managing succession for and retention of key executives is critical to our success and failure to do so could have an adverse impact on our future performance 

our ability to attract engage develop and retain qualified and experienced employees at all levels including in executive and other key strategic positions is essential for us to meet our objectives we compete with many other businesses to attract and retain employees competition among potential employers might result in increased salaries benefits or other employeerelated costs or in our failure to recruit and retain employees we may experience sudden loss of key personnel due to a variety of causes such as illness and must adequately plan for succession of key roles any of these risks could have a materially adverse impact on our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

any failure to adequately plan for and manage succession of senior management and other key management roles or the failure of key employees to successfully transition into new roles could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations while we have succession plans in place and employment arrangements with certain key executives these do not guarantee the services of these executives will continue to be available to us in july 2020 we announced a search for a new chief executive officer ceo we also announced that when the new ceo takes office stefano pessina will resign as ceo and executive vice chairman of the board and be appointed as the executive chairman of the board subject to applicable law including fiduciary duties and james skinner will resign as executive chairman of the board while remaining on the board to help facilitate a smooth transition any significant leadership change or senior management transition involves inherent risks and any failure to timely hire a qualified ceo and ensure a smooth transition could hinder the company’s strategic planning execution and future performance changes in the senior management team also may create uncertainty among investors employees business partners and others concerning the company’s future direction and performance any disruption in the company’s operations or adverse impacts from such uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

we could be adversely affected by a decrease in the introduction of new brand name and generic prescription drugs as well as increases in the cost to procure prescription drugs 

the profitability of our pharmacy businesses depends upon the utilization of prescription drugs utilization trends are affected by among other factors the introduction of new and successful prescription drugs as well as lowerpriced generic alternatives to existing brand name drugs inflation in the price of drugs also can adversely affect utilization particularly given the increased prevalence of highdeductible health insurance plans and related plan design changes new brand name drugs can result in increased drug utilization and associated sales while the introduction of lower priced generic alternatives typically results in relatively lower sales but relatively higher gross profit margins accordingly a decrease in the number or magnitude of significant new brand name drugs or generics successfully introduced delays in their introduction or a decrease in the utilization of previously introduced prescription drugs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

in addition if we experience an increase in the amounts we pay to procure pharmaceutical drugs including generic drugs it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations our gross profit margins would be adversely affected to the extent we are not able to offset such cost increases any failure to fully offset any such increased prices and costs or to modify 

 12  

our activities to mitigate the impact could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations additionally any future changes in drug prices could be significantly different than our expectations 

consolidation and strategic alliances in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business operations competitive positioning financial condition and results of operations 

many organizations in the healthcare industry including pbm companies have consolidated in recent years to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater bargaining power which has resulted in greater pricing pressures if this consolidation trend continues it could give the resulting enterprises even greater bargaining power which may lead to further pressure on the prices for our products and services if these pressures result in reductions in our prices our businesses would become less profitable unless we are able to achieve corresponding reductions in costs or develop profitable new revenue streams 

new and proposed acquisitions partnerships and strategic alliances in the healthcare industry also can alter market dynamics and impact our businesses and competitive positioning for example in november 2018 cvs health corporation an integrated pharmacy health care company that operates one of the largest retail drugstore chains and pbm companies in the united states acquired aetna inc one of the largest diversified health care benefits companies changes in the participants in global sourcing enterprises relating to drug procurement whether as a result of mergers acquisitions or other transactions can also have a similar effect on market dynamics and our business in addition further consolidation among generic drug manufacturers could lead to generic drug inflation in the future we expect that market demand government regulation thirdparty reimbursement policies government contracting requirements and other pressures will continue to cause the healthcare industry to evolve potentially resulting in further business consolidations and alliances and increased vertical integration among the industry participants we engage with and which could if we are not able to successfully anticipate and respond to evolving industry conditions in a timely and effective manner materially and adversely impact our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

our growth strategy is partially dependent upon our ability to identify and successfully complete acquisitions joint ventures and other strategic partnerships and alliances 

a significant element of our growth strategy is to identify pursue and successfully complete and integrate acquisitions joint ventures and other strategic partnerships and alliances that either expand or complement our existing operations we have grown significantly through acquisitions in recent years and expect to continue to acquire partner with or invest in businesses that build on or are deemed complementary to our existing businesses or further our strategic objectives for example in july 2020 the company announced that it plans to invest 10 billion in equity and convertible debt in villagemd over the next three years including a 250 million equity investment completed in july 2020 subject to the terms of the agreement the company and villagemd also announced plans to open 500 to 700 “village medical at walgreens” physicianled primary care clinics in more than 30 us markets in the next five years due in part to consolidation in the industries in which we compete there is significant competition for attractive targets and opportunities when available there can be no assurance that attractive acquisition or other strategic relationship opportunities will be available that we will be successful in identifying negotiating and consummating favorable transaction opportunities or that any such transactions we complete will be successful and justify our investment of financial and other resources 

acquisitions and other strategic transactions involve numerous risks including difficulties in successfully integrating the operations and personnel navigating the necessary regulatory approval requirements distraction of management from overseeing and disruption of our existing operations difficulties in entering markets or lines of business in which we have no or limited direct prior experience the possible loss of key employees and customers and difficulties in achieving the synergies we anticipated any failure to select suitable opportunities at fair prices conduct appropriate due diligence and successfully integrate the acquired company including particularly when acquired businesses operate in new geographic markets or areas of business could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations these transactions may also cause us to significantly increase our interest expense leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition or investment issue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders’ percentage ownership or incur asset writeoffs and restructuring costs and other related expenses that could have a material adverse impact on our operating results acquisitions joint ventures and strategic investments also involve numerous other risks including potential exposure to assumed litigation and unknown environmental and other liabilities as well as undetected internal control regulatory or other issues or additional costs not anticipated at the time the transaction was completed no assurance can be given that our acquisitions joint ventures and other strategic partnerships and alliances will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business operations financial condition or results of operations if we are unable to successfully identify complete and integrate acquisitions joint ventures and strategic investments in a timely and effective manner our business operations and growth strategies could be adversely affected 

 13  

our strategic relationships include outsourcing and similar relationships we outsource certain business and administrative functions and rely on third parties to perform certain services on our behalf we rely on these third parties to meet our quality and performance requirements and to timely perform as expected we periodically negotiate provisions and renewals of these relationships and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to us or such third parties if our continuing relationship with certain thirdparty providers is interrupted or if such thirdparty providers experience disruptions or do not perform as anticipated or we experience problems with any transition we may experience operational difficulties reputational harm and increased costs that could materially and adversely affect our business operations and results of operations 

we are exposed to risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings 

we operate in a highly regulated and litigious environment we are involved in legal proceedings including litigation arbitration and other claims and investigations inspections audits claims inquiries and similar actions by pharmacy healthcare tax and other governmental authorities including those contained in note 10 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for example in january 2019 walgreen co on behalf of itself its subsidiaries and certain identified affiliates resolved matters regarding certain dispensing practices by entering into among other things a corporate integrity agreement with the office of inspector general of the united states department of health and human services the corporate integrity agreement has a fiveyear term and provides that walgreen co shall among other things continue the compliance program it created to address compliance with federal health care program requirements provide annual certifications of compliance and provide training and education for certain covered employees failure to meet the corporate integrity agreement obligations could have material adverse consequences for us including reputational harm and monetary penalties for each instance of noncompliance in addition in the event of a breach or deliberate violation of the corporate integrity agreement we could be excluded from participation in federal healthcare programs or subjected to other significant penalties which could seriously harm our results of operations liquidity and financial results 

legal proceedings in general and securities derivative action and class action and multidistrict litigation in particular can be expensive and disruptive some of these suits may purport or may be determined to be class actions andor involve parties seeking large andor indeterminate amounts including punitive or exemplary damages and may remain unresolved for several years for example we are a defendant in numerous litigation proceedings relating to opioid matters including federal multidistrict litigation that consolidated numerous cases filed against an array of defendants by various plaintiffs such as counties cities hospitals indian tribes and others as well as numerous lawsuits brought in state courts additionally the company has received from the department of justice and the attorney generals of numerous states subpoenas civil investigative demands andor other requests concerning opioid matters from time to time the company is also involved in legal proceedings as a plaintiff involving antitrust tax contract intellectual property and other matters see note 10 commitments and contingencies for more information 

the company’s financial results may also be adversely affected by the litigation and other legal proceedings of companies in which it has an equity method investment for example amerisourcebergen is required to publicly disclose in its sec filings certain information regarding material litigation and legal proceedings it is involved in including those relating to opioid matters if applicable any unfavorable outcome or settlement related to these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results 

like other companies in the retail pharmacy and pharmaceutical wholesale industries the company is subject to extensive regulation by national state and local government agencies in the united states and other countries in which it operates there continues to be a heightened level of review andor audit by regulatory authorities of and increased litigation regarding business compliance and reporting practices of the company and other industry participants as a result the company regularly is the subject of government actions of the types described above in addition under the qui tam or “whistleblower” provisions of the federal and various state false claims acts persons may bring lawsuits alleging that a violation of the federal antikickback statute or similar laws has resulted in the submission of “false” claims to federal andor state healthcare programs including medicare and medicaid after a private party has filed a qui tam action the government must investigate the private partys claim and determine whether to intervene in and take control over the litigation these actions may remain under seal while the government makes this determination 

we cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies and the costs incurred in litigation can be substantial regardless of the outcome substantial unanticipated verdicts fines and rulings do sometimes occur as a result we could from time to time incur judgments enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters and such developments could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued andor our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid in addition as a result of governmental investigations or proceedings the company may be subject to damages civil or 

 14  

criminal fines or penalties or other sanctions including the possible suspension or loss of licensure andor suspension or exclusion from participation in government programs the outcome of some of these legal proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could negatively affect our operations additionally defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management’s attention and resources 

our business results depend on our ability to successfully manage ongoing organizational change and business transformation and achieve cost savings and operating efficiency initiatives 

our board of directors approved the plans to implement the transformational cost management program described in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii item 7 below as part of an initiative to reduce costs and increase operating efficiencies there can be no assurance that we will realize in full or in part the anticipated benefits of these programs our financial goals assume a level of productivity improvement including those reflected in the transformational cost management program and other business optimization initiatives if we are unable to deliver these expected productivity improvements while continuing to invest in business growth or if the volume and nature of change overwhelms available resources our business operations and financial results could be materially and adversely impacted our ability to successfully manage and execute these initiatives and realize expected savings and benefits in the amounts and at the times anticipated is important to our business success any failure to do so which could result from our inability to successfully execute organizational change and business transformation plans changes in global or regional economic conditions competition changes in the industries in which we compete unanticipated costs or charges loss of key personnel and other factors described herein could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition and results of operations 

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and constantly evolving new entrants to the market existing competitor actions or other changes in market dynamics could adversely impact us 

the level of competition in the retail pharmacy and pharmaceutical wholesale industries is high changes in market dynamics or actions of competitors or manufacturers including industry consolidation and the emergence of new competitors and strategic alliances could materially and adversely impact us disruptive innovation or the perception of potentially disruptive innovation by existing or new competitors could alter the competitive landscape in the future and require us to accurately identify and assess such changes and if required make timely and effective changes to our strategies and business model to compete effectively for example in 2018 online retailer amazoncom inc acquired pillpack an online pharmacy with licenses throughout the united states helping amazon to expand into the market for prescription drugs our retail pharmacy businesses face intense competition from local regional national and global companies including other drugstore and pharmacy chains independent drugstores and pharmacies mailorder pharmacies and various other retailers such as grocery stores convenience stores mass merchants online and omnichannel pharmacies and retailers warehouse clubs dollar stores and other discount merchandisers some of which are aggressively expanding in markets we serve businesses in our pharmaceutical wholesale division face intense competition from direct competitors including national and regional cooperative wholesalers and alternative supply sources such as importers and manufacturers who supply directly to pharmacies competition may also come from other sources in the future as competition increases in the markets in which we operate a significant increase in general pricing pressures could occur including pressure on the convenience premium of our retail pricing model which could require us to reevaluate our pricing structures to remain competitive for example if we are not able to anticipate and successfully respond to changes in market conditions in our pharmaceutical wholesale division including changes driven by competitors suppliers or manufacturers and increased competition from national and regional cooperative wholesalers it could result in a loss of customers or renewal of contracts or arrangements on less favorable terms 

we also could be adversely affected if we fail to identify or effectively respond to changes in market dynamics as technology consumer behavior omnichannel and differential retail models and market conditions continue to evolve in the united states it is important that we maintain the relevance of our brand and product and service offerings to customers and patients in recent years we announced that we are testing a number of concepts and initiatives designed to position our stores in the united states as convenient neighborhood health destinations for healthcare and retail products and services the concepts being tested include new approaches to pricing and promotions product selection instore and digital experience and strategic partnerships that bring new products and services to our customers we plan to use these pilots to listen to customers learn and adjust based on feedback with decisions on the nature and extent of further rollouts made over time as we gain experience for example the company and villagemd announced a collaboration in april 2019 where villagemd would operate five primary care clinics next to walgreens stores in the houston texas area and based on the results of that pilot in july 2020 announced plans to open 500 to 700 “village medical at walgreens” physicianled primary care clinics in more than 30 us markets in the next five years if our customers are not receptive to these changes if we are unable to expand successful programs in a timely manner or we otherwise do not effectively respond to changes in market dynamics our businesses and financial performance could be materially and adversely affected additionally specialty pharmacy represents a significant and growing proportion of 

 15  

prescription drug spending in the united states a significant portion of which is dispensed outside of traditional retail pharmacies because our specialty pharmacy business focuses on complex and highcost medications many of which are made available by manufacturers to a limited number of pharmacies socalled limited distribution drugs that serve a relatively limited universe of patients the future growth of this business depends to a significant extent upon expanding our ability to access key drugs and successfully penetrate key treatment categories accordingly it is important that we and our affiliates compete effectively in this evolving and highly competitive market or our business operations financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected to better serve this evolving market in march 2017 we and prime therapeutics llc a pbm closed a transaction to form a combined central specialty pharmacy and mail services company alliancerx walgreens prime using an innovative model that seeks to align pharmacy pbm and health plans to coordinate patient care improve health outcomes and deliver cost of care opportunities prime’s clients are not obligated to contract through our joint venture and have in the past and may in the future enter into specialty pharmacy and other agreements without involving our joint venture if this joint venture is not able to compete effectively in this evolving and highly competitive market and successfully adapt to changing market conditions our business operations financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

our substantial international business operations subject us to a number of operating economic political regulatory and other international business risks 

our substantial international business operations are important to our growth and prospects including particularly those of our retail pharmacy international and pharmaceutical wholesale divisions and are subject to a number of risks including 

• compliance with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations including retail and wholesale pharmacy licensing tax foreign trade intellectual property privacy and data protection immigration currency political and other business restrictions and requirements and local laws and regulations whose interpretation and enforcement vary significantly among jurisdictions and can change significantly over time 

• additional us and other regulation of nondomestic operations including regulation under the foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other anticorruption laws 

• potential difficulties in managing foreign operations mitigating credit risks in foreign markets enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems 

• price controls imposed by foreign countries tariffs duties or other restrictions on foreign currencies or trade sanctions and other trade barriers imposed by foreign countries that restrict or prohibit business transactions in certain markets or fluctuations in currency rates 

• impact of recessions and economic slowdowns in economies outside the united states including foreign currency devaluation higher interest rates inflation and increased government regulation or ownership of traditional private businesses 

• the instability of foreign economies governments and currencies and unexpected regulatory economic or political changes in foreign markets and 

• developing and emerging markets may be especially vulnerable to periods of instability and unexpected changes and consumers in those markets may have relatively limited resources to spend on products and services 

these factors can also adversely affect our payers vendors and customers in international markets which in turn can negatively impact our businesses we cannot assure you that one or more of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations results of operation and financial condition 

many of these factors are subject to change based on changes in political economic and regulatory influences for example 

• our retail pharmacy international and pharmaceutical wholesale divisions have substantial operations in the united kingdom and other member countries of the european union in june 2016 voters in the united kingdom approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the european union which resulted in the united kingdom leaving the european union on january 31 2020 since the referendum there have been periods of significant volatility in the global stock markets and currency exchange rates as well as challenging market conditions in the united kingdom and many of the risks and uncertainties described above have been and may continue to be exacerbated there is now a transition period until december 31 2020 in which the united kingdom and european union are to negotiate a new

trading relationship for goods and services failure to complete negotiations by the implementation deadline of december 31 2020 could result in the united kingdom reverting to undesirable and adverse trade agreements with the european union given the complexity and uncertainty surrounding the withdrawal and related negotiations including with respect to terms of trade and customs there can be no assurance regarding the terms timing or consummation of any such arrangements the withdrawal could among other potential outcomes adversely affect the tax tax treaty currency operational legal and regulatory regimes to which our businesses in the region are subject the withdrawal could also among other potential outcomes disrupt the free movement of goods services and people between the united kingdom and the european union and significantly disrupt trade between the united kingdom and the european union and other parties further uncertainty around and developments regarding these and related issues has contributed to deteriorating market conditions and could further adversely impact consumer and investor confidence and the economy of the united kingdom and the economies of other countries in which we operate and cause significant volatility in currency exchange rates and 

• many of the products we sell are manufactured in whole or in part outside of the united states in some cases these products are imported by others and sold to us in the united states the presidential administration has discussed and in some cases implemented changes with respect to certain tax and trade policies tariffs and other government regulations affecting trade between the united states and other countries for example concerns regarding trade relations between the united states and china have escalated in recent years and discussions have continued through the date of this report as both countries imposed significant tariffs on the importation of certain product categories as a significant portion of our retail products are sourced from china the imposition on the united states of these and any additional new tariffs on certain goods imported from china have adversely affected costs and could impact the profitability of retail product sales in our retail pharmacy usa division while it is not possible to predict whether or when any additional changes will occur or what form they may take significant changes in tax or trade policies tariffs or trade relations between the united states and other countries could result in significant increases in our costs restrict our access to certain suppliers and adversely impact economic activity in addition other countries may change their business and trade policies in anticipation of or in response to increased import tariffs and other changes in united states’ trade policy and regulations 

there can be no assurance that any or all of these developments will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations results of operations and financial condition 

we are exposed to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

we operate or have equity method investments in more than 25 countries across the globe and our significant presence outside of the united states exposes us to currency exchange rate fluctuations and related risks including transaction currency exposures relating to the import and export of goods in currencies other than businesses’ functional currencies as well as currency translation exposures relating to profits and net assets denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we present our financial statements in us dollars and have a significant proportion of net assets and income in nonus dollar currencies primarily the british pound sterling and the euro as well as a range of other foreign currencies our results of operations and capital ratios can therefore be sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future results of operations in addition fluctuations in currencies relative to the us dollar may make it more difficult to perform periodtoperiod comparisons of our reported results of operations a depreciation of nonus dollar currencies relative to the us dollar could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations 

we may from time to time in some instances enter into foreign currency contracts or other derivative instruments intended to hedge a portion of our foreign currency fluctuation risks which subjects us to additional risks such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations to us that could materially and adversely affect us additionally we may and currently do use foreign currency debt to hedge some of our foreign currency fluctuation risks the periodic use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place we cannot assure you that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates including particularly the strengthening of the us dollar against major currencies or the currencies of large developing countries will not materially affect our consolidated financial results 

a significant disruption in our information technology and computer systems or those of businesses we rely on could harm us 

we rely extensively on our computer systems to manage our ordering pricing pointofsale pharmacy fulfillment inventory replenishment customer loyalty programs finance and other processes our systems are subject to damage or interruption from 

 17  

power outages facility damage computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches including credit card or personally identifiable information breaches vandalism theft natural disasters catastrophic events human error and potential cyber threats including malicious codes worms phishing attacks denial of service attacks ransomware and other sophisticated cyber attacks and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities if any of our systems are damaged fail to function properly or otherwise become unavailable we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience loss or corruption of critical data and interruptions or disruptions and delays in our ability to perform critical functions which could materially and adversely affect our businesses and results of operations 

in addition we are currently making and expect to continue to make substantial investments in our information technology systems and infrastructure some of which are significant upgrades involve replacing existing systems with successor systems outsourcing critical information technology to third parties making changes to existing systems including the migration of applications to the cloud or costeffectively acquiring new systems with new functionality implementing new systems carries significant potential risks including failure to operate as designed potential loss or corruption of data or information changes in security processes cost overruns implementation delays disruption of operations and the potential inability to meet business and reporting requirements we rely on strategic partners and other service providers to help us with certain significant information technology projects and services including tata consultancy services to whom the company is currently transitioning its it run and operational managed services and microsoft who is the company’s strategic cloud provider and with whom the company has a strategic partnership to develop new health care delivery models technology and retail innovations to advance and improve the future of health care information technology projects or services frequently are longterm in nature and may take longer to complete and cost more than we expect and may not deliver the benefits we project once they are complete furthermore pursuing multiple initiatives simultaneously could make implementation significantly more challenging we are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems and outsourcing critical information technology functions and there can be no assurance that we will not experience significant issues with our existing systems prior to implementation that our technology initiatives will be successfully deployed as planned or that they will be timely implemented without significant disruption to our operations we also could be adversely affected by any significant disruption in the systems of third parties we interact with including strategic and business partners key payers and vendors any system implementation and transition difficulty may result in operational challenges reputational harm and increased costs that could materially and adversely affect our business operations and results of operations 

privacy and data protection laws increase our compliance burden and any failure to comply could harm us 

the regulatory environment surrounding data security and privacy is increasingly demanding with the frequent imposition of new and changing requirements across businesses and geographic areas we are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing data security and privacy regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate that regulate the collection use and transfer of personal data including the transfer of personal data between or among countries in the united states for example hipaa imposes extensive privacy and security requirements governing the transmission use and disclosure of health information by covered entities in the health care industry including health care providers such as pharmacies in addition the california consumer privacy act which went into effect on january 1 2020 imposes stringent requirements on the use and treatment of “personal information” of california residents and other jurisdictions have enacted or are proposing similar laws related to the protection of personal data outside the united states for example the european union’s general data protection regulation which became effective in may 2018 greatly increased the jurisdictional reach of european union data protection laws and added a broad array of requirements for handling personal data including the public disclosure of significant data breaches and provides for greater penalties for noncompliance other countries have enacted or are considering enacting data localization laws that require certain data to stay within their borders 

complying with changing regulatory requirements requires us to incur substantial costs and may require changes to our business practices in certain jurisdictions any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations and operating results we may also face audits or investigations by various government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations compliance with changes in privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes failure to comply with these laws subjects us to potential regulatory enforcement activity fines private litigation including class actions and other costs we also have contractual obligations that might be breached if we fail to comply a significant privacy breach or failure to comply with privacy laws could have a materially adverse impact on our reputation business operations financial position and results of operations 

we and businesses we interact with experience cybersecurity incidents and might experience significant computer system compromises or data breaches 

the protection of customer employee and company data is critical to our businesses cybersecurity and other information technology security risks such as a significant breach or theft of customer employee or company data could create significant 

 18  

workflow disruption attract a substantial amount of media attention damage our customer relationships reputation and brand and result in lost sales fines or lawsuits throughout our operations we receive retain and transmit certain personal information that our customers and others provide to purchase products or services fill prescriptions enroll in promotional programs participate in our customer loyalty programs register on our websites or otherwise communicate and interact with us in addition aspects of our operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks we also depend on and interact with the information technology networks and systems of thirdparties for many aspects of our business operations including payers strategic partners and cloud service providers these third parties may have access to information we maintain about our company operations customers employees and vendors or operating systems that are critical to or can significantly impact our business operations like other global companies we and businesses we interact with have experienced threats to data and systems including from vandalism or theft of physical systems or media and from perpetrators of random or targeted malicious cyberattacks computer viruses worms phishing attacks bot attacks or other destructive or disruptive software and attempts to misappropriate customer information including credit card information and cause system failures and disruptions 

compromises of our data security systems or of those of businesses with whom we interact which result in confidential information being accessed obtained damaged or used by unauthorized or improper persons have in the past and could in the future adversely impact us any such compromise could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions customer attrition remediation expenses and claims from customers financial institutions payment card associations and other persons any of which could materially and adversely affect our reputation business operations financial condition and results of operations in addition security incidents may require that we expend substantial additional resources related to the security of information systems and disrupt our businesses the risks associated with data security and cybersecurity incidents have increased during the covid19 pandemic given the increased reliance on remote work arrangements 

a significant change in or noncompliance with governmental regulations and other legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and profitability 

we operate in complex highly regulated environments around the world and could be materially and adversely affected by changes to applicable legal requirements including the related interpretations and enforcement practices new legal requirements andor any failure to comply with applicable regulations businesses in our pharmaceutical wholesale division are subject to a range of regulations relating to such things as product margins product traceability and the conditions under which products must be stored our retail pharmacy and health and wellness services businesses are subject to numerous country state and local regulations including licensing billing practices utilization and other requirements for pharmacies and reimbursement arrangements the regulations to which we are subject include but are not limited to country and state registration and regulation of pharmacies and drug discount card programs dispensing and sale of controlled substances and products containing pseudoephedrine applicable governmental payer regulations including medicare and medicaid data privacy and security laws and regulations including hipaa the aca or any successor thereto laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters each of which continues to evolve including those governing exposure to and the management and disposal of hazardous substances regulations regarding food and drug safety including those of the us food and drug administration “fda” and drug enforcement administration “dea” trade regulations including those of the us federal trade commission and consumer protection and safety regulations including those of the consumer product safety commission as well as state regulatory authorities governing the availability sale advertisement and promotion of products we sell as well as our loyalty and drug discount card programs antikickback laws false claims laws laws against the corporate practice of medicine and foreign national and state laws governing health care fraud and abuse and the practice of the profession of pharmacy for example in the united states the dea fda and various other regulatory authorities regulate the distribution and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances we are required to hold valid dea and statelevel licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with the federal and various state controlled substance acts and related regulations governing the sale dispensing disposal holding and distribution of controlled substances the dea fda and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations we are also governed by foreign national and state laws of general applicability including laws regulating matters of working conditions health and safety and equal employment opportunity and other labor and employment matters as well as employee benefit competition and antitrust matters in addition we could have significant exposure if we are found to have infringed another party’s intellectual property rights 

changes in laws regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may alter the landscape in which we do business and may significantly affect our cost of doing business the impact of new laws regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices generally cannot be predicted and changes in applicable laws regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may require extensive system and operational changes be difficult to implement increase our operating costs and require significant capital expenditures untimely 

 19  

compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties that could adversely affect the continued operation of our businesses including suspension of payments from government programs loss of required government certifications loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government programs including the medicare and medicaid programs in the united states and the national health service in the united kingdom loss of licenses and significant fines or monetary penalties any failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements in the united states or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in significant legal and financial exposure damage to our reputation and brand and have a material adverse effect on our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

we could be adversely affected by violations of antibribery anticorruption andor international trade laws 

we are subject to laws concerning our business operations and marketing activities in foreign countries where we conduct business for example we are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” us export control antimoney laundering and economic and trade sanction laws and similar anticorruption and international trade laws in certain foreign countries such as the uk bribery act any violation of which could create substantial liability for us and also harm our reputation the fcpa generally prohibits us companies and their officers directors employees and intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment the fcpa also requires that us public companies maintain books and records that fairly and accurately reflect transactions and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls if we are found to have violated the fcpa us export control economic and trade sanctions or antimoney laundering laws or any other antibribery anticorruption or international trade laws or to have otherwise conducted business activities inappropriately or unethically including through acts of bribery corruption conflicts of interest fraud manipulation of records or dealings with inappropriate business counterparties or partners we may face penalties sanctions including civil and criminal fines disgorgement of profits and suspension or debarment of our ability to contract with governmental agencies or receive export licenses in addition new initiatives may be proposed from time to time that impact the trading conditions in certain countries or regions and may include retaliatory duties or trade sanctions which if enacted could adversely impact our trading relationships with vendors or other parties in such locations and have a material adverse effect on our operations from time to time we may face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign governmental agencies relating to our international business activities compliance with which could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations an adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could damage our reputation and subject us to fines or other penalties which could materially and adversely affect our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

disruption in our global supply chain could negatively impact our businesses 

the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors and any future disruption in our supply chain or inability to find qualified vendors and access products that meet requisite quality and safety standards in a timely and efficient manner could adversely impact our businesses the loss or disruption of such supply arrangements for any reason including for issues such as covid19 or other health epidemics or pandemics labor disputes loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites inability to procure sufficient raw materials quality control issues ethical sourcing issues a supplier’s financial distress natural disasters looting vandalism or acts of war or terrorism trade sanctions or other external factors over which we have no control could interrupt product supply and if not effectively managed and remedied have a material adverse impact on our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

we use a single wholesaler of branded and generic pharmaceutical drugs as our primary source of such products for our retail pharmacy usa division 

in march 2013 walgreens alliance boots and amerisourcebergen announced various agreements and arrangements including a tenyear pharmaceutical distribution agreement between walgreens and amerisourcebergen pursuant to which we source branded and generic pharmaceutical products from amerisourcebergen in the united states and an agreement which provides amerisourcebergen the ability to access generic pharmaceutical products through our global sourcing enterprise in may 2016 certain of these agreements were extended for three years to now expire in 2026 in addition in march 2013 walgreens alliance boots and amerisourcebergen entered into agreements and arrangements pursuant to which we have the right to purchase a minority equity position in amerisourcebergen and gain associated representation on amerisourcebergen’s board of directors in certain circumstances as of the date of this report amerisourcebergen distributes for our retail pharmacy usa division substantially all branded and generic pharmaceutical products consequently our business in the united states may be adversely affected by any operational financial or regulatory difficulties that amerisourcebergen experiences including those resulting from covid19 for example if amerisourcebergen’s operations are seriously 

 20  

disrupted for any reason whether due to a natural disaster pandemic labor disruption regulatory action computer or operational systems or otherwise it could adversely affect our business in the united states and our results of operations 

our distribution agreement with amerisourcebergen is subject to early termination in certain circumstances and upon the expiration or termination of the agreement there can be no assurance that we or amerisourcebergen will be willing to renew the agreement or enter into a new agreement on terms favorable to us or at all if such expiration or termination occurred we believe that alternative sources of supply for most generic and brandname pharmaceuticals are readily available and that we could obtain and qualify alternative sources which may include selfdistribution in some cases for substantially all of the prescription drugs we sell on an acceptable basis such that the impact of any such expiration or termination would be temporary however there can be no assurance we would be able to engage alternative supply sources or implement selfdistribution processes on a timely basis or on terms favorable to us or effectively manage these transitions any of which could adversely affect our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

the anticipated strategic and financial benefits of our relationship with amerisourcebergen may not be realized 

as of august 31 2020 we beneficially owned approximately 28 of the outstanding amerisourcebergen common stock and had designated one nominee for election to amerisourcebergen’s board of directors in addition we have the right but not the obligation under the transactions contemplated by the framework agreement dated as of march 18 2013 by and among the company alliance boots and amerisourcebergen the “framework agreement” to acquire up to an additional 8398752 amerisourcebergen shares in the open market and thereafter designate another nominee for election to amerisourcebergen’s board of directors subject in each case to applicable legal and contractual requirements there can be no assurance that we will complete any specific level of such potential equity investments in amerisourcebergen or that our existing investment or any future investment if completed will ultimately be profitable 

the company accounts for its investment in amerisourcebergen using the equity method of accounting subject to a twomonth reporting lag with the net earnings attributable to the investment classified within the operating income of the company’s pharmaceutical wholesale segment the financial performance of amerisourcebergen including any charges which may arise relating to its ongoing opioid litigation matters will impact the company’s results of operations additionally a substantial and sustained decline in the price of amerisourcebergen’s common stock could trigger an impairment evaluation of our investment these considerations may materially and adversely affect the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

further our ability to transact in amerisourcebergen securities is subject to certain restrictions set forth in our agreements with amerisourcebergen and arising under applicable laws and regulations which in some circumstances could adversely our ability to transact in amerisourcebergen securities in amounts and at the times desired we could also encounter unforeseen costs circumstances or issues existing or arising with respect to the transactions and collaboration resulting from these agreements many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs decreased revenue decreased synergies and the diversion of management time and attention if we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame or at all the expected benefits may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we make investments in companies over which we do not have sole control some of these companies may operate in sectors that differ from our current operations and have different risks 

from time to time we make debt or equity investments in companies that we may not control or over which we may not have sole control for example while we have a significant equity investment in amerisourcebergen and have a designee serving on the board of directors of amerisourcebergen as of the date of this report we do not have the ability to control daytoday operations of that company some of the businesses in which we have made noncontrolling investments operate in markets or industries that are different from our primary lines of business andor operate in different geographic markets than we do for example we have an equity investment in villagemd a leading provider of valuebased primary care services in the united states and sinopharm holding guoda drugstores co ltd a leading retail pharmacy chain in china investments in these businesses among other risks subject us to the operating and financial risks of the businesses we invest in and to the risk that we do not have sole control over the operations of these businesses we rely on the internal controls and financial reporting controls of these entities and their failure to maintain effectiveness or comply with applicable standards may materially and adversely affect us investments in entities over which we do not have sole control including joint ventures and strategic partnerships and alliances present additional risks such as having differing objectives from our partners or the entities in which we are invested becoming involved in disputes or competing with those persons 

 21  

changes in economic conditions could adversely affect consumer buying practices 

our performance has been and may continue to be adversely impacted by changes in global national regional or local economic conditions and consumer confidence these conditions can also adversely affect our key vendors and customers external factors that affect consumer confidence and over which we exercise no influence include unemployment rates inflation levels of personal disposable income levels of taxes and interest and global national regional or local economic conditions health epidemics or pandemics such as covid19 as well as looting vandalism acts of war or terrorism changes in economic conditions and consumer confidence could adversely affect consumer preferences purchasing power and spending patterns which could lead to a decrease in overall consumer spending as well as in prescription drug and health services utilization and which could be exacerbated by the increasing prevalence of highdeductible health insurance plans and related plan design changes our business operations have been adversely affected by challenging market conditions in our retail pharmacy international division particularly our boots business in the united kingdom on account of the economic environment including the impacts of covid19 and the uncertainty associated with brexit in addition reduced or flat consumer spending may drive us and our competitors to offer additional products at promotional prices all of these factors could materially and adversely impact our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

if we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant omnichannel experience for our customers our businesses and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

the portion of total consumer expenditures with retailers occurring online and through mobile applications has continued to increase and has accelerated significantly during the covid19 pandemic the pace of this increase could further accelerate in the future our business has evolved from an instore experience to interaction with customers across numerous channels including instore online mobile and social media among others omnichannel and differentiated retail models are rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing customer expectations and new developments by our competitors our customers are increasingly using computers tablets mobile phones and other devices to comparison shop determine product availability and complete purchases as well as to provide immediate public reactions regarding various facets of our operations we must compete by offering a consistent and convenient shopping experience for our customers regardless of the ultimate sales channel and by investing in providing and maintaining digital tools for our customers that have the right features and are reliable and easy to use if we are unable to make improve or develop relevant customerfacing technology in a timely manner that keeps pace with technological developments and dynamic customer expectations our ability to compete and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected in addition if our online activities or our other customerfacing technology systems do not function as designed we may experience a loss of customer confidence data security breaches lost sales or be exposed to fraudulent purchases any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations reputation and results of operations 

if the merchandise and services that we offer fail to meet customer needs our sales may be adversely affected 

we could be adversely affected by changes in consumer spending levels and shopping habits and preferences including attitudes towards our retail and product brands the success of our retail pharmacy businesses depends on our ability to offer a superior shopping experience engaging customer service and a quality assortment of available merchandise that differentiates us from other retailers including enhanced health and beauty product offerings we must identify obtain supplies of and offer to our customers attractive innovative and highquality merchandise on a continuous basis our products and services must satisfy the needs and desires of our customers whose preferences may change in the future for example our proof of concept initiatives that seek to position our stores in the united states as convenient neighborhood health destinations for healthcare and retail products and services reflect the perceived desires and needs of our target market however it is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand if we misjudge either the demand for products and services we sell or our customers’ purchasing habits and tastes we may be faced with excess inventories of some products and missed opportunities for products and services we chose not to offer in addition our sales may decline or we may be required to sell the merchandise we have obtained at lower prices failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences and spending patterns and evolving demographic mixes in the markets we serve could negatively affect our relationship with our customers and the demand for our products and services which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations 

our private brand offerings expose us to various additional risks 

in addition to brand name products we offer our customers private brand products that in many instances are not available from other retailers we seek to continue to grow our private brand offerings as part of our growth strategy including through the offering of no7 and other brands owned or licensed on an exclusive basis as well as through selective acquisitions maintaining consistent product quality competitive pricing and availability of our private brand offerings for our customers as well as the timely development and introduction of new products is important in differentiating us from other retailers and 

 22  

developing and maintaining customer loyalty the expansion of our private brand offerings also subjects us to additional risks such as potential product liability risks and mandatory or voluntary product recalls our ability to successfully protect our proprietary rights and successfully navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties our ability to successfully administer and comply with applicable contractual obligations and regulatory requirements and other risks generally encountered by entities that source sell and market exclusive branded offerings for retail an increase in sales of our private brands may also adversely affect sales of our vendors’ products which in turn could adversely affect our relationship with certain of our vendors any failure to adequately address some or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business operations results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to paymentrelated and other financial services risks that could increase our operating costs expose us to fraud or theft subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business operations 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including cash checks credit and debit cards gift cards and mobile payment technologies such as apple pay™ and we may offer new payment options over time acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules regulations contractual obligations and compliance requirements including payment network rules and operating guidelines data security standards and certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers these requirements and related interpretations may change over time which has made and could continue to make compliance more difficult or costly for certain payment methods including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which could increase over time and raise our operating costs we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards and other forms of electronic payment if these companies become unable to provide these services to us or if their systems are compromised it could disrupt our business the payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by persons who seek to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit any weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems if we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements or if data is compromised due to a breach or misuse of data relating to our payment systems we may be liable for costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments could be impaired in addition our reputation could suffer and our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types which could result in higher costs andor reduced sales and materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

additionally we offer money wire transfer services and sell prepaid debit credit and gift cards at certain business units these products and services require us to comply with global antimoney laundering laws and regulations failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines sanctions penalties and damage to our reputation 

changes in the healthcare industry and regulatory environments may adversely affect our businesses 

political economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to significant changes that could adversely affect our results of operations in recent years the healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to reduce costs and government spending these changes include an increased reliance on managed care cuts in certain medicare and medicaid funding in the united states and the funding of governmental payers in foreign jurisdictions consolidation of competitors suppliers and other market participants and the development of large sophisticated purchasing groups we expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future some of these potential changes such as a reduction in governmental funding for certain healthcare services or adverse changes in legislation or regulations governing prescription drug pricing healthcare services or mandated benefits may cause customers to reduce the amount of our products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services we expect continued governmental and private payer pressure to reduce pharmaceutical pricing and these pressures could be further exacerbated if payer deficits or shortfalls increase due to covid19 or otherwise changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers’ pricing or distribution policies and practices as well as applicable government regulations including for example in connection with the federal 340b drug pricing program could also significantly reduce our profitability 

in the united states electoral results and changes in political leadership often generate uncertainty with respect to and could result in significant changes in legislation regulation and government policy that could significantly impact our businesses and the healthcare and retail industries we cannot predict whether current or future efforts to modify healthcare laws or regulations andor adopt new healthcare legislation or regulations will be successful nor can we predict the impact that such a development would have on our business and operating results future legislation or rulemaking or other regulatory actions or developments could impact the number of americans with health insurance and consequently prescription drug coverage increase regulation of pharmacy services result in changes to pharmacy reimbursement rates and otherwise change the way we do business we cannot predict the timing or impact of any future legislative rulemaking or other regulatory actions but any such actions could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

 23  

we could be adversely affected by product liability product recall personal injury or other health and safety issues 

we could be adversely impacted by the supply of defective or expired products including the infiltration of counterfeit products into the supply chain errors in relabeling of products product tampering product recall and contamination or product mishandling issues through our pharmacies and specialist packaging sites including through services provided by thirdparty health care providers we are also exposed to risks relating to the services we offer errors in the dispensing and packaging of pharmaceuticals including related counseling and in the provision of other healthcare services could lead to serious injury or death product liability or personal injury claims may be asserted against us with respect to any of the retail products or pharmaceuticals we sell or services we provide for example from time to time the fda issues statements alerting patients that products in our supply chain may contain impurities or harmful substances and claims relating to the sale or distribution of such products may be asserted against us or arise from these statements our healthcare clinics also increase our exposure to professional liability claims related to medical care should a product or other liability issue arise the coverage limits under our insurance programs and the indemnification amounts available to us may not be adequate to protect us against claims and judgments we also may not be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms in the future we could suffer significant reputational damage and financial liability if we or any affiliated entities or thirdparty healthcare providers that we do business with experience any of the foregoing health and safety issues or incidents which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

we have significant outstanding debt our debt and associated payment obligations could significantly increase in the future if we incur additional debt and do not retire existing debt 

we have outstanding debt and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity in an effort to strengthen our liquidity position while navigating covid19 we took a number of proactive steps in fiscal 2020 including the issuance of longterm debt entering into new revolving credit facilities and extending an existing facility and establishing a euro commercial paper program as described in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resources” below as of august 31 2020 we had approximately 16 billion of outstanding indebtedness including shortterm debt our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including 

• requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal interest and other amounts payable on our debt which would reduce the funds we have available for other purposes such as working capital capital expenditures acquisitions share repurchases and dividends 

• making it more difficult or expensive for us to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital capital expenditures debt service requirements debt refinancing acquisitions or other purposes 

• reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our industry and market conditions and making us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business operations and 

• exposing us to interest rate risk given that a portion of our debt obligations is at variable interest rates 

we may incur or assume significantly more debt in the future including in connection with acquisitions strategic investments or joint ventures if we add new debt and do not retire existing debt the risks described above could increase we also could be adversely impacted by any failure to renew or replace on terms acceptable to us or at all existing funding arrangements when they expire and any failure to satisfy applicable covenants 

additionally a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at fluctuating interest rates some of which is tied to the london interbank offered rate for deposits of us dollars “libor” libor tends to fluctuate based on general interest rates rates set by the federal reserve and other central banks the supply of and demand for credit in the london interbank market and general economic conditions in july 2017 the united kingdom financial conduct authority which regulates libor announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 moreover it is possible that libor may be discontinued prior to the end of 2021 certain of our credit facilities provide that under certain circumstances set forth in such credit facilities we and the administrative agent may amend the applicable credit facility to replace libor with an alternate benchmark rate giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar syndicated credit facilities in the us market for alternative benchmarks the expected phase out of libor and transition to and use of an alternative benchmark rate could cause market volatility or disruption and may adversely affect our access to the capital markets and cost of funding 

 24  

our longterm debt obligations include covenants that may adversely affect our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur certain secured indebtedness or engage in certain types of transactions in addition our existing credit agreements require us to maintain as of the last day of each fiscal quarter a ratio of consolidated debt to total capitalization not to exceed a certain level our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants may be affected by events beyond our control if we breach any of these restrictions or covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable this could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition 

we could be adversely affected by downgrades to our credit ratings or disruptions in our ability to access wellfunctioning capital markets 

historically we have relied on the public debt capital markets to fund portions of our capital investments and access to the commercial paper market and bank credit facilities as part of our working capital management strategy financial and credit markets have experienced and may continue to experience significant volatility and turmoil during the covid19 pandemic our continued access to these markets and the terms of such access depend on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets our operating performance and our credit ratings the major credit rating agencies have assigned us and our corporate debt investment grade credit ratings as of the date of this report these ratings are based on a number of factors which include their assessment of our financial strength and financial policies we benefit from investment grade ratings as they serve to lower our borrowing costs and facilitate our access to a variety of lenders and other creditors including landlords for our leased stores on terms that we consider advantageous to our businesses for more information on our ratings see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources  credit ratings” below 

there can be no assurance that any particular rating assigned to us will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency if in that rating agency’s judgment future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating so warrant which in some circumstances could adversely affect benefits we currently enjoy incurrence of additional debt by us and our changes in our operating performance whether due to business operations covid19 legal proceedings or otherwise could adversely affect our credit ratings we depend on banks and other financial institutions to provide credit to our business and perform under our agreements with them defaults by one or more of these counterparties on their obligations to us could materially and adversely affect us any disruptions or turmoil in the capital markets or any actual or anticipated downgrade of our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade or have been assigned a negative outlook could adversely affect our cost of funds liquidity financial covenants competitive position and access to capital markets and increase the cost of and counterparty risks associated with existing facilities which could materially and adversely affect our business operations financial condition and results of operations in addition we utilize working capital financing arrangements including receivable factoring programs changes in financial markets or interest rates could make these financing arrangements less attractive to the financial institutions and other counterparties and these financial institutions and other counterparties may seek to terminate their participation in the event of such termination our ability to effectively manage working capital could be adversely impacted 

we may be unable to keep existing store locations or open new locations in desirable places on favorable terms which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores local land use and zoning regulations environmental regulations and other regulatory requirements may impact our ability to find suitable locations and influence the cost of constructing renovating and operating our stores in addition real estate zoning construction and other delays may adversely affect store openings and renovations and increase our costs further changing local demographics at existing store locations may adversely affect revenue and profitability levels at those stores the terms of leases at existing store locations may adversely affect us if the renewal terms of or requested modifications to those leases are unacceptable to us and we are forced to close or relocate stores for example we announced plans as part of our transformational cost management program to exit approximately 200 boots stores in the united kingdom and approximately 250 stores in the united states if we determine to close or relocate a store subject to a lease we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for the balance of the lease term if we are unable to maintain our existing store locations or open new locations in desirable places and on favorable terms our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

as a holding company walgreens boots alliance is dependent on funding from its operating subsidiaries to pay dividends and other obligations 

walgreens boots alliance is a holding company with no business operations of its own its assets primarily consist of direct and indirect ownership interests in and its business is conducted through subsidiaries which are separate legal entities as a result it is dependent on funding from its subsidiaries including walgreens and international subsidiaries to meet its obligations 

 25  

additionally walgreens boots alliance’s subsidiaries may be restricted in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions to walgreens boots alliance which may limit the payment of cash dividends or other distributions to the holders of walgreens boots alliance common stock credit facilities and other debt obligations of walgreens boots alliance as well as statutory provisions may further limit the ability of walgreens boots alliance and its subsidiaries to pay dividends payments to walgreens boots alliance by its subsidiaries are also contingent upon its subsidiaries’ earnings and business considerations future walgreens boots alliance dividends will be determined based on earnings capital requirements financial condition and other factors considered relevant by its board of directors 

our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly 

our operating results have historically varied on a quarterly basis including increased variability during the covid19 pandemic and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future factors that may affect our quarterly operating results some of which are beyond the control of management include but are not limited to the impact and duration of covid19 the timing of the introduction of new generic and brand name prescription drugs inflation including with respect to generic drug procurement costs seasonality including the timing and severity of the cough cold and flu season changes or rates of change in payer reimbursement rates and terms the timing and amount of periodic contractual reconciliation payments fluctuations in inventory energy transportation labor healthcare and other costs significant acquisitions dispositions joint ventures and other strategic initiatives asset impairment charges including the performance of and impairment charges related to our equity method investments the relative magnitude of our lifo provision in any particular quarter foreign currency fluctuations market conditions including any impact relating to brexit severe weather in key markets widespread looting or vandalism and many of the other risk factors discussed herein accordingly we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and investors should not place undue reliance on the results of any particular quarter as an indication of our future performance 

our businesses are seasonal in nature and adverse events during the holiday and cough cold and flu seasons could adversely impact our operating results 

our businesses are seasonal in nature with the second fiscal quarter december january and february typically generating a higher proportion of retail sales and earnings than other fiscal quarters we purchase significant amounts of seasonal inventory in anticipation of the holiday season adverse events such as deteriorating economic conditions higher unemployment higher gas prices public transportation disruptions or unanticipated adverse weather could result in lowerthanplanned sales during key selling seasons for example frequent or unusually heavy snowfall ice storms rainstorms windstorms or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period could make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and increase our snow removal and other costs this could lead to lower sales or to unanticipated markdowns negatively impacting our financial condition and results of operations in addition both prescription and nonprescription drug sales are affected by the timing and severity of the cough cold and flu season which can vary considerably from year to year 

we could be adversely impacted by changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters 

generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our businesses including but not limited to revenue recognition asset impairment impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets inventories equity method investments vendor rebates and other vendor consideration lease obligations selfinsurance liabilities pension and postretirement benefits tax matters unclaimed property laws and litigation and other contingent liabilities are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition for example changes in accounting standards and the application of existing accounting standards particularly related to the measurement of fair value as compared to carrying value for the company’s reporting units including goodwill intangible assets and investments in equity interests may have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include significant adverse changes in the business climate and declines in the financial condition of a reporting unit or asset group factors that could lead to impairment of investments in equity interests of the companies in which we invested include a prolonged period of decline in their operating performance or adverse changes in the economic regulatory and legal environments of the countries in which they operate although our current accounting estimates contemplate current and expected future conditions as applicable actual conditions could differ from our expectations which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position in particular a number of estimates have been and will continue to be affected by the ongoing covid19 pandemic the severity magnitude and duration as well as the economic consequences of covid19 are uncertain rapidly changing and difficult to predict as a result our accounting estimates and assumptions may change over time such changes could result in 

 26  

future impairments of goodwill intangible assets longlived assets excess and obsolete inventory or a decrease in the carrying amount of our deferred tax assets which could be material 

new accounting guidance also may require changes to our processes accounting systems and internal controls that could increase our operating costs andor significantly change our financial statements implementing new accounting guidance may require us to make significant changes to and investments in our accounting systems and processes which could result in significant adverse changes to our financial statements see “new accounting pronouncements” within note 1 summary of major accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements 

we have a substantial amount of goodwill and other intangible assets which could in the future become impaired and result in material noncash charges to our results of operations 

as of august 31 2020 we had 260 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheets we evaluate this goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that could more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinitelived intangible asset below its carrying value as part of this impairment analysis we determine fair value for each reporting unit using both the income and market approaches we determine fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets using the relief from royalty method and excess earnings method of the income approach definitelived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable estimated fair values could change if for example there are changes in the business climate changes in the competitive environment adverse legal or regulatory actions or developments changes in capital structure cost of debt and equity capital expenditure levels operating cash flows or market capitalization whether due to covid19 or otherwise for example during the three months ended may 31 2020 the company completed a quantitative impairment analysis for goodwill and certain indefinitelived intangible assets related to its two reporting units within retail pharmacy international division and based on this analysis recorded impairment charges of 17 billion on boots goodwill and 03 billion on certain indefinitelived boots tradename assets see note 6 goodwill and other intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements and management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii item 7 below for additional information there can be no assurance that further impairments will not occur 

we could be subject to adverse changes in tax laws regulations and interpretations or challenges to our tax positions 

we are a large corporation with operations in the united states and numerous other jurisdictions around the world as such we are subject to tax laws and regulations of the us federal state and local governments as well as various foreign jurisdictions we compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate as the tax rates vary among jurisdictions a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision 

from time to time changes in tax laws or regulations may be proposed or enacted that could adversely affect our overall tax liability for example the us tax legislation enacted in december 2017 represented a significant overhaul of the us federal tax code that impacted our us federal income tax position there can be no assurance that changes in tax laws or regulations both within the united states and the other jurisdictions in which we operate will not materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate tax payments financial condition and results of operations similarly changes in tax laws and regulations that impact our customers and counterparties or the economy generally may also impact our financial condition and results of operations 

tax laws and regulations are complex and subject to varying interpretations and we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative impact on our effective tax rate tax payments financial condition and results of operations in addition the determination of our income tax provision and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain the ultimate tax determination may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our results of operations in the period or periods for which such determination is made any significant failure to comply with applicable tax laws and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions could give rise to substantial penalties and liabilities any changes in enacted tax laws such as the recent us tax legislation rules or regulatory or judicial interpretations or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could materially and adversely impact our effective tax rate tax payments financial condition and results of operations 

 27  

we might experience substantial losses not covered by insurance 

we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance to provide for potential liability for workers’ compensation automobile and general liability property director and officers’ liability and employee healthcare benefits provisions for losses related to selfinsured risks generally are based upon actuarially determined estimates any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability substantial unanticipated losses or liabilities including those due to natural disasters or otherwise as well as changes in legal claims trends and interpretations variability in inflation rates changes in the nature and method of claims settlement benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws insolvency of insurance carriers and changes in discount rates could all materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we could be adversely impacted by changes in assumptions used in calculating pension assets and liabilities 

we operate certain defined benefit pension plans in the united kingdom which were closed to new entrants in 2010 as well as smaller plans in other jurisdictions the valuation of the pension plans’ assets and liabilities depends in part on assumptions which are primarily based on the financial markets as well as longevity and employee retention rates this valuation is particularly sensitive to material changes in the value of equity bond and other investments held by the pension plans changes in the corporate bond yields which are used in the measurement of the liabilities changes in market expectations for longterm price inflation and new evidence on projected longevity rates funding requirements and the impact on the statement of earnings relating to these pension plans are also influenced by these factors adverse changes in the assumptions used to calculate the value of pension assets and liabilities including lower than expected pension fund investment returns andor increased life expectancy of plan participants or regulatory change could require us to increase the funding of its defined benefit pension plans or incur higher expenses which would adversely impact our results of operations and financial position 

certain stockholders may have significant voting influence over matters requiring stockholder approval 

as of september 30 2020 stefano pessina our executive vice chairman and chief executive officer together with his affiliates the “sp investors” had sole or shared voting power directly or indirectly over an aggregate of approximately 169 of our outstanding common stock the sp investors have agreed to for so long as they have the right to designate a nominee for election to the board to vote all of their shares of common stock in accordance with the board’s recommendation on matters submitted to a vote of the company’s stockholders including with respect to the election of directors the sp investors’ significant interest in our common stock potentially could determine the outcome of matters submitted to a vote by our stockholders the influence of the sp investors could result in the company taking actions that other stockholders do not support or failing to take actions that other stockholders support as a result the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected 

conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest may arise because certain of our directors and officers are also owners or directors of companies we may have dealings with 

conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest could arise between our interests and the interests of the other entities and business activities in which our directors or officers are involved for example potential conflicts of interest could arise if a dispute were to arise between the company and other parties to the company shareholders agreement as defined herein including the sp investors mr pessina our executive vice chairman and chief executive officer indirectly controls alliance santé participations sa “asp” a privatelyheld company which is a party to the company shareholders agreement and he and his partner ornella barra our cochief operating officer serve as directors of asp there are other arrangements between affiliates of mr pessina and the company with required disclosures included in the company’s annual proxy statement including with respect to alliance healthcare italia spa which is an entity indirectly owned and controlled by mr pessina and in which the company has an indirect 9 interest which operates boots branded stores in italy conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest or similar issues could arise in connection with these or other transactions in the future while our contractual arrangements place restrictions on the parties’ conduct in certain situations and related party transactions are subject to independent review and approval in accordance with our related party transaction approval procedures and applicable law the potential for a conflict of interest exists and such persons may have conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting both companies 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws delaware law andor our agreements with certain stockholders may impede the ability of our stockholders to make changes to our board or impede a takeover 

certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as provisions of the delaware general corporation law the “dgcl” could make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the board or discourage delay or prevent a merger consolidation or acquisitions that stockholders may otherwise consider favorable these provisions include 

 28  

the authorization of the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that could be issued by the board limitations on the ability of stockholders to call special meetings and advance notice requirements for nomination for election to the board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings we are also subject to the provisions of section 203 of the dgcl which prohibits us except under specified circumstances from engaging in any mergers significant sales of stock or assets or business combinations with any stockholder or group of stockholders who own 15 or more of our common stock 

under the company shareholders agreement the sp investors are entitled to designate one nominee to the board currently stefano pessina for so long as the sp investors continue to meet certain beneficial ownership thresholds and subject to certain other conditions pursuant to the company shareholders agreement the sp investors have agreed that for so long as they have the right to designate a nominee to the board they will vote all of their shares of common stock in accordance with the board’s recommendation on matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders including with respect to the election of directors 

while these provisions do not make us immune from takeovers or changes in the composition of the board and are intended to protect our stockholders from among other things coercive or otherwise unfair tactics these provisions could have the effect of making it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the board or discouraging delaying or preventing a merger consolidation or acquisitions that stockholders may otherwise consider favorable 

we cannot guarantee that our stock repurchase program will be fully implemented or that it will enhance longterm stockholder value 

in june 2018 our board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to 10 billion of our common stock the repurchase program does not have an expiration date and we are not obligated to repurchase a specified number or dollar value of shares on any particular timetable or at all there can be no assurance that we will repurchase stock at favorable prices activity under this program was suspended in july 2020 and there can be no assurance whether or when activity will resume if resumed the repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time and even if fully implemented may not enhance longterm stockholder value

in december 2019 a novel strain of coronavirus which causes the infectious disease known as covid19 was reported the world health organization declared covid19 a “public health emergency of international concern” on january 30 2020 and a global pandemic on march 11 2020 covid19 has severely impacted and is expected to continue to impact the economies of the us the uk and other countries around the world covid19 has created significant public health concerns as well as significant volatility uncertainty and economic disruption in every region in which we operate all of which have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our industries and our business operations further financial and credit markets have experienced and may again experience volatility and turmoil policies and initiatives designed to reduce the transmission of covid19 have resulted in among other things temporary closure or reduced hours of operation of certain store locations in us uk and other countries reduced customer traffic and sales in our retail pharmacies and the adoption of workfromhome policies 

covid19 adversely affected global economic conditions in fiscal 2020 and the company expects this will continue into fiscal 2021 and possibly longer the situation surrounding covid19 remains fluid and we are actively managing our response in collaboration with customers government officials team members and business partners and assessing potential impacts to our financial position and operating results as well as developments in our business as covid19 impacts the economies of the us and other countries around the world the company has put preparedness plans in place at our facilities to maintain continuity of our operations while also taking steps to keep our team members healthy and safe 

 36  

during the fiscal 2020 we experienced certain adverse impacts of covid19 particularly in the second half of fiscal 2020 sales were adversely impacted with the majority of the decline within the retail pharmacy international division reflecting a significant reduction in footfall in boots uk stores particularly in major high street train stations and airport locations due to government restrictions footfall did however improve steadily in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter while most boots stores remained open throughout the uk lockdown to provide communities with pharmacy and essential healthcare our largest premium beauty and fragrance counters were effectively closed during the three months ended may 31 2020 more than 100 boots stores mainly in high street train stations and airport locations were temporarily closed as were nearly all of the 600 boots opticians stores globally pharmacy volume was impacted by a decline in doctor visits and hospital patient admissions in the third quarter however trends improved in the three months ended august 31 2020 in new to therapy scripts compared to the prior quarter additionally retail gross margin was adversely impacted by sales mix with a shift from higher margin discretionary categories to lower margin essential categories and by higher supply chain costs the company took measures to keep stores open during covid19 incurring incremental selling general and administrative expenses including higher employee costs and store expenses related to social distancing and incremental cleaning operating income was significantly and adversely impacted as a result of the foregoing factors in addition due to the significant impact of covid19 on the financial performance of the retail pharmacy international division the company completed a quantitative impairment analysis for goodwill and certain intangibles in boots uk which resulted in the recording of noncash pretax impairment charges of 20 billion during the three months ended may 31 2020 

in an effort to strengthen our liquidity position while navigating covid19 we have taken a number of proactive steps since march 2020 including the issuance of 15 billion of debt securities entry into new and extended credit facilities establishing a euro commercial paper program and suspending activity under our 2018 stock repurchase program as described in liquidity and capital resources below 

in response to covid19 various domestic and foreign federal state and local governmental legislation regulations orders policies and initiatives have been implemented designed to reduce the transmission of covid19 as well as to help address economic and market volatility and instability resulting from covid19 the company has assessed and will continue to assess the impact of these governmental actions on the company it has participated in certain of these programs including for example availing itself to certain tax deferrals which were introduced by the cares act in the us and certain tax deferral and benefit and employee wage support in the uk and may continue to do so in the future 

the company has also taken a number of proactive actions consistent with regulatory directives such as digital order ahead drivethru with an increased range of products available for drivethru pickup and put in place new delivery options available nationwide in the us to continue to work with customers and manage through the pandemic the company has launched a new covid19 testing program for businesses and also completed more than two million covid19 tests across the us and uk the company also took certain actions during fiscal 2020 to partly mitigate the impact of covid19 through cost containment across the company including temporary store closures furloughing approximately 16000 uk employees at the peak of the crisis decreasing store hours and reducing rent at some locations 

as a result of covid19 a portion of our global workforce including employees and extended workforce rapidly shifted to a working from home environment beginning in march 2020 and many continue to work remotely while our system of internal controls were not specifically designed and implemented to accommodate for this shift we have evaluated and concluded that these changes to the working environment did not have a material effect on the company’s internal control over financial reporting during the second half of fiscal 2020 as described in item 9a controls and procedures below the company will continue to monitor and assess the covid19 situation and its internal controls and seek to mitigate any impact on their design and operating effectiveness 

the company anticipates additional mandates and directives including revisions thereto from foreign federal state county and city authorities throughout the continuation of the covid19 pandemic and for some time thereafter the impact of this activity on the us and global economies and consumer customer and health care utilization patterns depends upon the evolving factors and future developments as a result the financial andor operational impact these covid19 related governmental actions and inactions will have on our businesses operating results cash flows andor financial condition is uncertain but the collective impact could be material and adverse 

we continue to closely monitor the impact of covid19 on our business and geographies including how it is impacting our customers team members suppliers vendors business partners and distribution channels however the future impact that covid19 will have on our financial position and operating results may be affected by numerous uncertainties including the severity of the virus the duration of the outbreak governmental business or other actions impacts on our supply chain the effect on customer demand store closures or changes to our operations the health of our workforce and our ability to meet staffing needs in our stores distribution facilities wholesale operations and other critical functions cannot be predicted and is vital to our operations the impacts of a potential worsening of global economic conditions and the continued disruptions to 

 37  

and volatility in the credit and financial markets and consumer spending as well as other unanticipated consequences remain unknown further additional waves of covid19 in fiscal 2021 or beyond would cause many of the impacts described herein to return or be exacerbated in addition we cannot predict with certainty the impact that covid19 will have on our customers vendors suppliers and other business partners however any material effect on these parties could adversely impact us

commitments and contingencies 

the information set forth in note 10 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this form 10k is incorporated herein by reference 

critical accounting policies 

the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and include amounts based on management’s prudent judgments and estimates actual results may differ from these estimates management believes that any reasonable deviation from those judgments and estimates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations to the extent that the estimates used differ from actual results however adjustments to the consolidated statements of earnings and corresponding consolidated balance sheets accounts would be necessary these adjustments would be made in future periods some of the more significant estimates include business combinations goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment longlived assets impairment cost of sales and inventory equity method investments pension and postretirement benefits and income taxes the company uses the following methods to determine its estimates 

  

business combinations – the company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that once control is obtained all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition the determination of fair values of assets and liabilities acquired requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available 

for intangible assets the company generally uses the income approach to determine fair value the income approach requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions primarily include but are not limited to discount rates terminal growth rates royalty rates forecasts of revenue operating income depreciation amortization and capital expenditures the discount rates applied to the projections reflect the risk factors associated with those projections 

although the company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on the determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired 

judgment is also required in determining the intangible asset’s useful life 

leases  the company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at the inception of a contract the lease classification is determined at the commencement date rightofuse assets represent the company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease during the lease term rightofuse assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of the remaining future minimum lease payments during the lease term the commencement date of all lease terms is the earlier of the date the company becomes legally obligated to make rent payments or the date the company has the right to control the property the company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments the incremental borrowing rate is based on the companys estimated rate of interest for a collateralized borrowing over a similar term as the lease term the operating lease rightofuse assets also include lease payments made before commencement lease incentives and are recorded net of impairment operating leases are expensed on a straight line basis over the lease term 

the lease term of real estate leases includes renewal options that are reasonably certain of being exercised options to extend are considered reasonably certain of being exercised based on evaluation if there is significant investments within the leased property which have useful lives greater than the noncancelable lease term performance of the underlying store and the company’s economic and strategic initiatives shortterm leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheets 

the company accounts for lease components and nonlease components as a single lease component variable lease payment amounts that cannot be determined at the commencement of the lease such as increases in lease payments based on changes in index rates or usage are not included in the rightofuse assets or lease liabilities these are expensed as incurred the company has real estate leases which require additional payments based on sales volume as well as reimbursement for real estate taxes common area maintenance and insurance which are expensed as incurred as variable lease costs and hence are not included in the lease payments used to calculate lease liability other real estate leases contain one fixed lease payment that 

 56  

includes real estate taxes common area maintenance and insurance these fixed payments are considered part of the lease payment and included in the rightofuse assets and lease liabilities the company does not separately account for the land portion of the leases involving land and building 

finance leases are recognized within property plant and equipment and as a finance lease liability within accrued expenses and other liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment – goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that could more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or intangible asset below its carrying value as part of the company’s impairment analysis fair value of a reporting unit is determined using both the income and market approaches the income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit including projected future operating results economic projections anticipated future cash flows and discount rates the market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping 

indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value indefinitelived intangible assets fair values are estimated using the relief from royalty method and excess earnings method of the income approach the determination of the fair value of the indefinitelived intangibles requires the company to make significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions primarily include but are not limited to forecasts of revenue the selection of appropriate royalty rate and discount rates 

during the three months ended may 31 2020 the company completed a quantitative impairment analysis for goodwill and certain indefinitelived intangible assets related to its two reporting units within retail pharmacy international division boots and other international as a result of the significant impact of covid19 on their financial performance based on this analysis the company recorded impairment charges of 17 billion on boots goodwill and 03 billion on certain indefinitelived boots tradename assets 

based on the annual evaluation as of june 1 2020 valuation date the fair values of the company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts ranging from approximately 4 to approximately 239 excluding boots reporting unit for which the excess of fair value over carrying amount was nominal due to an impairment charge recognized during the three months ended may 31 2020 other international reporting units fair value was in excess of its carrying value by approximately 4 compared to 16 on june 1 2019 as of august 31 2020 the carrying values of goodwill were 11 billion and 05 billion for boots reporting unit and other international reporting unit respectively the fair values of certain indefinitelived intangibles within the boots reporting unit exceeded their carrying amounts ranging from approximately 4 to approximately 31 excluding certain indefinitelived boots tradename assets for which the excess of fair values over carrying amounts were nominal due to impairment charges recognized during the three months ended may 31 2020 as of august 31 2020 the carrying value of the indefinitelived intangibles within the boots reporting unit was 72 billion during the fiscal year ended august 31 2019 the company recorded an impairment of 73 million on its pharmacy licenses in the boots reporting unit 

the determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires the company to make significant estimates and assumptions including the business and financial performance of the company’s reporting units as well as how such performance may be impacted by covid19 these estimates and assumptions primarily include but are not limited to the selection of appropriate peer group companies control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we compete discount rates terminal growth rates forecasts of revenue operating income depreciation amortization and capital expenditures including considering the impact of covid19 

although the company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions including the impact of covid19 could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units and indefinitelived intangibles the amount of any goodwill and indefinitelived intangible impairment charges or both these estimates can be affected by a number of factors including but not limited to the impact of covid19 its severity duration and its impact on global economies general economic conditions as well as our profitability the company will continue to monitor these potential impacts including the impact of covid19 and economic industry and market trends and the impact these may have on boots and other international reporting units 

the company also compares the sum of estimated fair values of reporting units to the company’s fair value as implied by the market value of its equity securities this comparison provides an indication that in total assumptions and estimates are reasonable future declines in the overall market value of the company’s equity securities may provide an indication that the fair value of one or more reporting units has declined below its carrying value

impairment of long lived assets  the company evaluates the recoverability of longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such an asset may not be recoverable the evaluation of longlived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows longlived assets related to the company’s retail operations include property plant and equipment definitelived intangibles right of use asset as well as operating lease liability if the asset group fails the recoverability test then an impairment charge is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the asset group compared to its carrying value fair value of the asset group is generally determined using income approach based on cash flows expected from the use and eventual disposal of the asset group 

the determination of the fair value of the asset group requires management to estimate a number of factors including anticipated future cash flows and discount rates although we believe these estimates are reasonable actual results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates 

cost of sales and inventory – cost of sales includes the purchase price of goods and cost of services rendered store and warehouse inventory loss inventory obsolescence and supplier rebates in addition to product costs cost of sales includes warehousing costs for retail operations purchasing costs freight costs cash discounts and vendor allowances 

cost of sales for our retail pharmacy usa segment is derived based upon pointofsale scanning information with an estimate for shrinkage and is adjusted based on periodic inventory counts inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market determined by the lastin firstout “lifo” method for the retail pharmacy usa segment and primarily on a firstin firstout “fifo” basis for inventory in the retail pharmacy international and pharmaceutical wholesale segments 

  

equity method investments   – the company uses the equity method of accounting for equity investments if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence but not control over operating and financial policies of the investee the company’s proportionate share of the net income or loss of these investees is included in consolidated net earnings judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as the company’s ownership interest legal form of the investee eg limited liability partnership representation on the board of directors participation in policymaking decisions and material intraentity transactions 

the company evaluates equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable factors considered by the company when reviewing an equity method investment for impairment include the length of time duration and the extent severity to which the fair value of the equity method investment has been less than cost the investee’s financial condition and nearterm prospects and the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery an impairment that is otherthantemporary is recognized in the period identified 

  

pension and postretirement benefits – the company has various defined benefit pension plans that cover some of its nonus employees the company also has a postretirement healthcare plan that covers qualifying us employees eligibility and the level of benefits for these plans vary depending on participants’ status date of hire and or length of service pension and postretirement plan expenses and valuations are dependent on assumptions used by thirdparty actuaries in calculating those amounts these assumptions include discount rates healthcare cost trends longterm return on plan assets retirement rates mortality rates and other factors 

in determining longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption the company considers both the historical performance of the investment portfolio as well as the longterm market return expectations based on the investment mix of the portfolio a change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on its pension expense a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in a decline of 4388 million to the company’s pension benefit obligation a 25 basis point decrease on the expected return on plan assets assumption would increase the company’s pension expense by 237 million 

the company funds its pension plans in accordance with applicable regulations the postretirement healthcare plan is not funded

limitations expires for the return containing the tax position or when more information becomes available the liability for unrecognized tax benefits including accrued penalties and interest is primarily included in other noncurrent liabilities and current income taxes on the company’s consolidated balance sheets and in income tax provision in its consolidated statements of earnings

the company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to existing variablerate debt instruments and future incurrences of fixed or variablerate debt which exposure primarily relates to movements in various interest rates such as us treasury rates and commercial paper rates from time to time the company uses interest rate swaps and forwardstarting interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to the impact of interest rate changes on existing debt and future debt issuances respectively to reduce the volatility of financing costs and based on current and projected market conditions achieve a desired proportion of fixedrate versus floatingrate debt generally under these swaps the company agrees with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixedrate and floatingrate interest amounts based on an agreed upon notional principal amount 

the chief executive of the uk financial conduct authority the “fca” which regulates the london interbank offered rate or libor has announced that the fca will no longer compel libor panel banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 that announcement indicates that the continuation of libor on the current basis will not be guaranteed after 2021 moreover it is possible that libor may be discontinued prior to the end of 2021 certain of our credit facilities provide that under certain circumstances set forth in such credit facilities we and the administrative agent may amend the applicable credit facility to replace libor with an alternate benchmark rate giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar syndicated credit facilities in the us market for alternative benchmarks such alternative benchmark rate could include the secured overnight financing rate also known as sofr published by the federal reserve bank of new york

 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this form 10k the controls evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of the company’s management including its chief executive officer “ceo” and chief financial officer “cfo” based upon the controls evaluation our ceo and cfo have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the sec and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management including the ceo and cfo as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

report on internal control over financial reporting 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting and the report of deloitte  touche llp the company’s independent registered public accounting firm related to their assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting are included in part ii item 8 of this form 10k and are incorporated in this item 9a by reference 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

in the ordinary course of business the company reviews its internal control over financial reporting and makes changes to its systems and processes that are intended to enhance such controls and increase efficiency while maintaining an effective internal control environment changes may include such activities as updating existing systems automating manual processes standardizing controls and modifying monitoring controls 

as a result of covid19 a portion of our global workforce including employees and extended workforce rapidly shifted to a working from home environment beginning in march 2020 and many continue to work remotely while our controls were not developed and designed to facilitate or accommodate this shift we have evaluated and concluded that these changes to the working environment did not have a material effect on the company’s internal control over financial reporting during the most recent quarter 

as we transform our business processes we continue to make strategic changes in how we perform certain key business functions these changes include the continued leveraging of extended workforces via thirdparty outsource arrangements as well as our continued implementation of new information systems specifically the company is currently implementing a new enterprise resource planning erp system this project is a multiyear initiative and is intended to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of certain financial and business transaction processes as well as the underlying systems environment these initiatives are not being implemented in response to any identified internal control deficiency or weakness as these changes occur we will evaluate quarterly whether such changes materially affect or are reasonably likely to materially affect the companys internal control over financial reporting 

in connection with the evaluation pursuant to exchange act rule 13a15d of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rule 13a15f by the company’s management including its ceo and cfo no changes during the quarter ended august 31 2020 were identified that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

our management including the ceo and cfo do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures

industry overview 

the retail pharmacy and pharmaceutical wholesale industries across the globe are highly competitive and dynamic and have experienced consolidation and an evolving competitive landscape in recent years prescription drugs play a significant role in healthcare and constitute a first line of treatment for many medical conditions the company believes the longterm outlook for prescription drug utilization is strong due in part to aging populations increases in life expectancy increases in the availability of generic drugs the continued development of innovative drugs that improve quality of life and control healthcare costs and increases in the number of persons with insurance coverage for prescription drugs including in the united states “baby boomers” increasingly becoming eligible for the federally funded medicare part d prescription program pharmaceutical wholesalers act as a vital link between drug manufacturers and pharmacies and healthcare providers in supplying pharmaceuticals to patients 

the retail pharmacy industry across the globe relies significantly on private and governmental thirdparty payers many private organizations throughout the healthcare industry including pharmacy benefit management “pbm” companies and health insurance companies have consolidated in recent years to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater bargaining power thirdparty payers including the medicare part d plans and the statesponsored medicaid and related managed care medicaid agencies in the united states can change eligibility requirements or reduce certain reimbursement rates in addition in many european countries the government provides or subsidizes healthcare to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices patient eligibility and reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored healthcare system changes in law or regulation also can impact reimbursement rates and terms for example the patient protection and affordable care act the “aca” was enacted to help control federal healthcare spending including for prescription drugs in the united states these changes generally are expected to reduce medicaid reimbursements in the united states state medicaid programs are also expected to continue to seek reductions in reimbursements when thirdparty payers or governmental authorities take actions that restrict eligibility or reduce prices or reimbursement rates sales and margins in the retail pharmacy industry could be reduced which would adversely affect industry profitability in some cases these possible adverse effects may be partially or entirely offset by controlling inventory costs and other expenses dispensing more higher margin generics finding new revenue streams through pharmacy services or other offerings andor dispensing a greater volume of prescriptions 

these industry dynamics and challenges are continuous and have intensified in recent years since the completion of the strategic combination with alliance boots in december 2014 the company has had a continuous focus on operational efficiencies and cost reduction 

generic prescription drugs have continued to help lower overall costs for customers and thirdparty payers the company expects the utilization of generic pharmaceuticals to continue to increase in general in the united states generic versions of drugs generate lower sales dollars per prescription but higher gross profit dollars as compared with patentprotected brand name drugs the impact on retail pharmacy gross profit dollars can be significant in the first several months after a generic version of a drug is first allowed to compete with the branded version which is generally referred to as a “generic conversion” in any given year the number of major brand name drugs that undergo a conversion from branded to generic status can vary and the timing of generic conversions can be difficult to predict which can have a significant impact on retail pharmacy sales and gross profit dollars in general in the united states specialty prescription business is also growing and generates higher sales dollars per prescription but lower gross margin as compared to generic prescription drugs 

the company expects that market demand government regulation thirdparty reimbursement policies government contracting requirements and other pressures will continue to cause the industries in which the company competes to evolve pharmacists are on the frontlines of the healthcare delivery system and the company believes rising healthcare costs and the limited supply of primary care physicians present opportunities for pharmacists and retail pharmacies to play an even greater role in driving positive outcomes for patients and payers through expanded service offerings such as immunizations and other preventive care healthcare clinics pharmacistled medication therapy management and chronic condition management

the division provides customers with convenient omnichannel access to consumer goods and services including own branded general merchandise such as well at walgreens nice no7 and soap  glory as well as pharmacy and health and wellness services in communities across the united states integrated with the company’s ecommerce platform the walgreens mobile application allows customers to refill prescriptions through scan technology receive notifications when a refill is due and engage with retail functionality such as photo and shopping features the division is also implementing new approaches to promotions product selection and other areas to deliver greater value to its customers in its stores including through an enhanced beauty offering 

the components of the division’s sales are pharmacy the sale of prescription drugs and provision of pharmacyrelated services and retail the sale of healthcare and retail products including nonprescription drugs beauty toiletries and general merchandise the division’s sales are subject to the influence of seasonality particularly the winter holiday and cough cold and flu seasons this seasonality also can affect the division’s proportion of sales between retail and pharmacy during certain periods the components of the division’s fiscal year sales were as follows 



the company filled 8437 million  prescriptions including immunizations in the division in fiscal 2019  adjusted to 30day equivalents prescriptions filled were 12 billion  in fiscal 2019  sales where reimbursement is received from managed care organizations governmental agencies pbm companies and private insurance were approximately 97  of the division’s fiscal 2019  pharmacy sales 

the company fills prescriptions for many state medicaid public assistance programs sales from all such medicaid plans were approximately 4  of the division’s fiscal 2019  sales sales from medicare part d plans were approximately 20  of the division’s fiscal 2019  sales

the company’s us loyalty program balance® rewards is designed to reward its most valuable customers and encourage shopping in stores and online balance® rewards members receive special pricing on select products and earn everyday rewards points for purchasing most merchandise that can be instantly redeemed in store or through walgreenscom as of august 31 2019  the number of active balance® rewards members totaled approximately 90 million  for this purpose an active member is defined here as someone who has used their card in the last six months 

amerisourcebergen supplies and distributes a significant amount of generic and branded pharmaceutical products to the division’s pharmacies the company purchases its nonpharmaceutical merchandise from numerous manufacturers and wholesalers 

the division’s sales gross profit margin and gross profit are impacted by among other things both the percentage of prescriptions filled that are generic and the rate at which new generic drugs are introduced to the market because any number of factors outside of the company’s control can affect timing for a generic conversion the company faces substantial uncertainty in predicting when such conversions will occur and what effect they will have on particular future periods 

the current environment of the company’s pharmacy business also includes ongoing reimbursement pressure and a shift in pharmacy mix towards 90day at retail one prescription that is the equivalent of three 30day prescriptions and medicare part d prescriptions further consolidation among generic manufacturers coupled with changes in the number of major brand name drugs anticipated to undergo a conversion from branded to generic status may also result in gross margin pressures within the industry 

the company continuously faces reimbursement pressure from pbm companies health maintenance organizations managed care organizations and other commercial thirdparty payers agreements with these payers are regularly subject to expiration termination or renegotiation in addition plan changes with rate adjustments often occur in january and the company’s reimbursement arrangements may provide for rate adjustments at prescribed intervals during their term the company experienced lower reimbursement rates in fiscal 2019  as compared to the same period in the prior year the company expects these pressures to continue 

the company has also worked to develop and expand its relationships with commercial thirdparty payers to enable new andor improved market access via participation in pharmacy provider networks they offer the prescription volume impact of new agreements and relationships typically is incremental over time 

the company’s 90day at retail prescription drug offering is typically at a lower margin than comparable 30day prescriptions but provides the company with the opportunity to increase business with patients with chronic prescription needs while offering increased convenience helping facilitate improved prescription adherence and resulting in a lower cost to fill the 90day prescription similarly the growing specialty prescription business which generates higher sales dollars per prescription may result in gross margin pressures within the industry as compared to generic prescription drugs

the division’s sales are subject to the influence of seasonality with the second fiscal quarter typically the strongest as a result of the winter holiday period this seasonality affects the division’s proportion of sales between retail and pharmacy during certain periods the components of the division’s fiscal year sales were as follows 



the division’s retail sales gross profit margin and gross profit dollars are impacted by among other things the highly competitive nature of the health and beauty category specifically the company and its competitors’ pricing actions promotional offers and events and the customer’s desire for value and convenience 

the division’s pharmacy sales gross margin and gross profit dollars are impacted by governmental agencies and other thirdparty payers seeking to minimize increases in the costs of healthcare including pharmaceutical drug reimbursement rates in the united kingdom which is the division’s largest market for pharmacy sales the amount of government funding available for pharmacy services is typically reviewed and agreed with the pharmacy industry on an annual basis 

in addition performance as measured in us dollars is impacted by the exchange rates used to translate these amounts into us dollars the exchange rate of british pound sterling being the most significant 

the division’s performance and relevant exchange rates are also impacted by the current geopolitical environment including the political uncertainty in the united kingdom surrounding “brexit” for more information relating to this topic see risk factors  our substantial international business operations subject us to a number of operating economic political regulatory and other international business risks

combined with local engagement scale is important in pharmaceutical wholesaling walgreens boots alliance is one of the largest pharmaceutical wholesalers and distributors in europe and it ranks as one of the top three in market share in many of the individual countries in which it operates 

the division’s sales gross profit margin and gross profit dollars are impacted by among other things government actions which typically seek to reduce the growth in prescription drug consumption reduce reimbursement rates and increase generic drug utilization a greater proportion of generic drugs whether as a result of government actions generic conversions or other factors typically has an adverse effect on the company’s revenues however in the wholesale division the company typically earns equal or better gross margins on generic drugs than on branded drugs although there are exceptions 

changes in manufacturers’ product distribution business models can also impact the division’s sales and gross margin for example when pharmaceutical drug manufacturers introduce feeforservice contracts the company’s sales are reduced even if it is successful in winning these contracts as the company only recognizes sales for the amount of the fees charged other manufacturer services including prewholesale and contract logistics operations are typically on a feeforservice basis 

in addition performance as measured in us dollars is impacted by the exchange rates used to translate these amounts into us dollars the exchange rate of british pound sterling and the euro being the most significant the division’s sales are subject to less seasonality than the company’s other divisions 

the division’s performance and relevant exchange rates are also impacted by the current geopolitical environment including the political uncertainty in the united kingdom surrounding “brexit” for more information relating to this topic see risk factors  our substantial international business operations subject us to a number of operating economic political regulatory and other international business risks

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information in this report and our other filings with the sec you should carefully consider the risks described below which could materially and adversely affect our business operations financial condition and results of operations these risks are not the only risks that we face our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial 

 8   

reductions in thirdparty reimbursement levels from private or governmental agency plans and potential changes in industry pricing benchmarks for prescription drugs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

the substantial majority of the prescriptions we fill are reimbursed by thirdparty payers including private and governmental agency payers the continued efforts of health maintenance organizations managed care organizations pbm companies governmental agencies and other thirdparty payers to reduce prescription drug costs and pharmacy reimbursement rates as well as litigation and other legal proceedings relating to how drugs are priced may adversely impact our results of operations in the united states plan changes with rate adjustments often occur in january and our reimbursement arrangements may provide for rate adjustments at prescribed intervals during their term in addition in an environment where some pbm clients utilize narrow or restricted pharmacy provider networks some of these entities may offer pricing terms that we may not be willing to accept or otherwise restrict our participation in their networks of pharmacy providers 

changes in political economic and regulatory influences also may significantly affect healthcare financing and prescription drug reimbursement practices in the united states for example there have been multiple attempts through executive action legislative action and legal challenges to modify or repeal the aca along with additional initiatives focused on increasing transparency and reducing costs in the us healthcare system we cannot predict whether current or future efforts to modify or repeal these laws will be successful nor can we predict the impact that such a modification or repeal and any subsequent legislation would have on our business and reimbursement levels there have also been a number of other proposals and enactments by the federal government and various states to reduce medicare part d and medicaid reimbursement levels in response to budget deficits and we expect additional proposals in the future in the event that a thirdparty payer’s budgetary or financial condition deteriorates they may not be able to pay timely or may delay payment of amounts owed to us there can be no assurance that recent or future changes in prescription drug reimbursement policies and practices will not materially and adversely affect our results of operations in many countries where we have operations the government provides or subsidizes healthcare to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices patient eligibility and reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored healthcare system efforts to control healthcare costs including prescription drug costs are continuous and reductions in thirdparty reimbursement levels could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

in addition many payers in the united states are increasingly considering new metrics as the basis for reimbursement rates it is possible that the pharmaceutical industry or regulators may evaluate andor develop an alternative pricing reference to replace average wholesale price which is the pricing reference used for many of our contracts in addition many state medicaid feeforservice programs have established pharmacy network payments on the basis of actual acquisition cost which could have an impact on reimbursement practices in other commercial and governmental arrangements future changes to the pricing benchmarks used to establish pharmaceutical pricing including changes in the basis for calculating reimbursement by thirdparty payers could adversely affect us 

a shift in pharmacy mix toward lower margin plans products and programs could adversely affect our results of operations 

our retail pharmacy usa division seeks to grow prescription volume while operating in a marketplace with continuous reimbursement pressure a shift in the mix of pharmacy prescription volume towards programs offering lower reimbursement rates could adversely affect our results of operations for example our retail pharmacy usa division has experienced a shift in pharmacy mix towards 90day at retail in recent years and specialty pharmacy represents a significant and growing proportion of prescription drug spending in the united states and a correspondingly larger proportion of our revenues our 90day at retail offering for patients with chronic prescription needs typically is at a lower margin than comparable 30day prescriptions and specialty pharmacy sales are generally also lower margin our retail pharmacy usa division also has experienced a shift in pharmacy mix towards medicare part d prescriptions in recent years and that trend may continue preferred medicare part d networks have increased in number in recent years however we do not participate in all such networks we have accepted lower reimbursement rates in order to secure preferred relationships with medicare part d plans serving senior patients with significant pharmacy needs we also have worked to develop and expand our relationships with commercial thirdparty payers to enable new andor improved market access via participation in the pharmacy provider networks they offer if we are not able to generate additional prescription volume and other business from patients participating in these programs that is sufficient to offset the impact of lower reimbursement or if the degree or terms of our participation in such preferred networks declines from current levels in future years our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we derive a significant portion of our sales in the united states from prescription drug sales reimbursed by a limited number of pharmacy benefit management companies 

 9   

we derive a significant portion of our sales in the united states from prescription drug sales reimbursed through prescription drug plans administered by a limited number of pbm companies pbm companies typically administer multiple prescription drug plans that expire at various times and provide for varying reimbursement rates and often limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list known as a formulary which might not include all of the approved drugs for a particular indication contracts with certain pbm companies that we have historically done substantial business with are due for renewal in fiscal 2020 there can be no assurance that we will continue to participate in any particular pbm company’s pharmacy provider network in any particular future time period or on terms reasonably acceptable to us if our participation in the pharmacy provider network for a prescription drug plan administered by one or more of the large pbm companies is restricted or terminated we expect that our sales would be adversely affected at least in the shortterm if we are unable to replace any such lost sales either through an increase in other sales or through a resumption of participation in those plans our operating results could be materially and adversely affected if we exit a pharmacy provider network and later resume participation there can be no assurance that we will achieve any particular level of business on any particular pace or that all clients of the pbm company will choose to include us again in the pharmacy network for their plans initially or at all in addition in such circumstances we may incur increased marketing and other costs in connection with initiatives to regain former patients and attract new patients covered by such plans 

we could be adversely affected by a decrease in the introduction of new brand name and generic prescription drugs as well as increases in the cost to procure prescription drugs 

the profitability of our pharmacy businesses depends upon the utilization of prescription drugs utilization trends are affected by among other factors the introduction of new and successful prescription drugs as well as lowerpriced generic alternatives to existing brand name drugs inflation in the price of drugs also can adversely affect utilization particularly given the increased prevalence of highdeductible health insurance plans and related plan design changes new brand name drugs can result in increased drug utilization and associated sales while the introduction of lower priced generic alternatives typically results in relatively lower sales but relatively higher gross profit margins accordingly a decrease in the number or magnitude of significant new brand name drugs or generics successfully introduced delays in their introduction or a decrease in the utilization of previously introduced prescription drugs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

in addition if we experience an increase in the amounts we pay to procure pharmaceutical drugs including generic drugs it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations our gross profit margins would be adversely affected to the extent we are not able to offset such cost increases any failure to fully offset any such increased prices and costs or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations additionally any future changes in drug prices could be significantly different than our expectations 

consolidation and strategic alliances in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business operations competitive positioning financial condition and results of operations 

many organizations in the healthcare industry including pbm companies have consolidated in recent years to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater bargaining power which has resulted in greater pricing pressures if this consolidation trend continues it could give the resulting enterprises even greater bargaining power which may lead to further pressure on the prices for our products and services if these pressures result in reductions in our prices our businesses would become less profitable unless we are able to achieve corresponding reductions in costs or develop profitable new revenue streams 

new and proposed acquisitions partnerships and strategic alliances in the healthcare industry also can alter market dynamics and impact our businesses and competitive positioning for example in november 2018 cvs health corporation an integrated pharmacy health care company that operates one of the largest retail drugstore chains and pbm companies in the united states acquired aetna inc one of the largest diversified health care benefits companies changes in the participants in global sourcing enterprises relating to drug procurement whether as a result of mergers acquisitions or other transactions can also have a similar effect on market dynamics and our business in addition further consolidation among generic drug manufacturers could lead to generic drug inflation in the future we expect that market demand government regulation thirdparty reimbursement policies government contracting requirements and other pressures will continue to cause the healthcare industry to evolve potentially resulting in further business consolidations and alliances and increased vertical integration among the industry participants we engage with and which could if we are not able to successfully anticipate and respond to evolving industry conditions in a timely and effective manner materially and adversely impact our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

our growth strategy is partially dependent upon our ability to identify and successfully complete acquisitions joint ventures and other strategic partnerships and alliances 

 10   

a significant element of our growth strategy is to identify pursue and successfully complete and integrate acquisitions joint ventures and other strategic partnerships and alliances that either expand or complement our existing operations we have grown significantly through acquisitions in recent years and expect to continue to acquire partner with or invest in businesses that build on or are deemed complementary to our existing businesses or further our strategic objectives due in part to consolidation in the industries in which we compete there is significant competition for attractive targets and opportunities when available there can be no assurance that attractive acquisition or other strategic relationship opportunities will be available that we will be successful in identifying negotiating and consummating favorable transaction opportunities or that any such transactions we complete will be successful and justify our investment of financial and other resources 

acquisitions and other strategic transactions involve numerous risks including difficulties in successfully integrating the operations and personnel navigating the necessary regulatory approval requirements distraction of management from overseeing and disruption of our existing operations difficulties in entering markets or lines of business in which we have no or limited direct prior experience the possible loss of key employees and customers and difficulties in achieving the synergies we anticipated any failure to select suitable opportunities at fair prices conduct appropriate due diligence and successfully integrate the acquired company including particularly when acquired businesses operate in new geographic markets or areas of business could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations these transactions may also cause us to significantly increase our interest expense leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition or investment issue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders’ percentage ownership or incur asset writeoffs and restructuring costs and other related expenses that could have a material adverse impact on our operating results acquisitions joint ventures and strategic investments also involve numerous other risks including potential exposure to assumed litigation and unknown environmental and other liabilities as well as undetected internal control regulatory or other issues or additional costs not anticipated at the time the transaction was completed no assurance can be given that our acquisitions joint ventures and other strategic partnerships and alliances will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business operations financial condition or results of operations if we are unable to successfully identify complete and integrate acquisitions joint ventures and strategic investments in a timely and effective manner our business operations and growth strategies could be negatively affected 

our strategic relationships include outsourcing and similar relationships we outsource certain business and administrative functions and rely on third parties to perform certain services on our behalf we rely on these third parties to meet our quality and performance requirements and to timely perform as expected we periodically negotiate provisions and renewals of these relationships and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to us or such third parties if our continuing relationship with certain thirdparty providers is interrupted or if such thirdparty providers experience disruptions or do not perform as anticipated or we experience problems with any transition we may experience operational difficulties reputational harm and increased costs that could materially and adversely affect our business operations and results of operations 

we are exposed to risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings 

we operate in a highly regulated and litigious environment we are involved in legal proceedings including litigation arbitration and other claims and investigations inspections audits claims inquiries and similar actions by pharmacy healthcare tax and other governmental authorities including those contained in note 10 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for example in january 2019 walgreen co on behalf of itself its subsidiaries and certain identified affiliates resolved matters regarding certain dispensing practices by entering into among other things a corporate integrity agreement with the office of inspector general of the united states department of health and human services the corporate integrity agreement has a fiveyear term and provides that walgreen co shall among other things continue the compliance program it created to address compliance with federal health care program requirements provide annual certifications of compliance and provide training and education for certain covered employees failure to meet the corporate integrity agreement obligations could have material adverse consequences for us including reputational harm and monetary penalties for each instance of noncompliance in addition in the event of a breach or deliberate violation of the corporate integrity agreement we could be excluded from participation in federal healthcare programs or subjected to other significant penalties which could seriously harm our results of operations liquidity and financial results 

legal proceedings in general and securities derivative action and class action and multidistrict litigation in particular can be expensive and disruptive some of these suits may purport or may be determined to be class actions andor involve parties seeking large andor indeterminate amounts including punitive or exemplary damages and may remain unresolved for several years for example we are a defendant in numerous litigation proceedings relating to opioids from time to time the company is also involved in legal proceedings as a plaintiff involving antitrust tax contract intellectual property and other matters see note 10 commitments and contingencies for more information 

 11   

the company’s financial results may also be adversely affected by the litigation and other legal proceedings of companies in which it has an equity method investment any unfavorable outcome or settlement related to these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results 

like other companies in the retail pharmacy and pharmaceutical wholesale industries the company is subject to extensive regulation by national state and local government agencies in the united states and other countries in which it operates there continues to be a heightened level of review andor audit by regulatory authorities of and increased litigation regarding the company’s and the rest of the health care and related industry’s business compliance and reporting practices as a result the company regularly is the subject of government actions of the types described above in addition under the qui tam or “whistleblower” provisions of the federal and various state false claims acts persons may bring lawsuits alleging that a violation of the federal antikickback statute or similar laws has resulted in the submission of “false” claims to federal andor state healthcare programs including medicare and medicaid after a private party has filed a qui tam action the government must investigate the private partys claim and determine whether to intervene in and take control over the litigation these actions may remain under seal while the government makes this determination 

we cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies and the costs incurred in litigation can be substantial regardless of the outcome substantial unanticipated verdicts fines and rulings do sometimes occur as a result we could from time to time incur judgments enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters and such developments could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued andor our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid in addition as a result of governmental investigations or proceedings the company may be subject to damages civil or criminal fines or penalties or other sanctions including the possible suspension or loss of licensure andor suspension or exclusion from participation in government programs the outcome of some of these legal proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could negatively affect our operations additionally defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management’s attention and resources 

our business results depend on our ability to successfully manage ongoing organizational change and business transformation and achieve cost savings and operating efficiency initiatives 

our board of directors approved the plans to implement the transformational cost management program and the store optimization program each as described in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii item 7 below as part of an initiative to reduce costs and increase operating efficiencies there can be no assurance that we will realize in full or in part the anticipated benefits of these programs our financial goals assume a level of productivity improvement including those reflected in the transformational cost management program the store optimization program and other business optimization initiatives if we are unable to deliver these expected productivity improvements while continuing to invest in business growth or if the volume and nature of change overwhelms available resources our business operations and financial results could be materially and adversely impacted our ability to successfully manage and execute these initiatives and realize expected savings and benefits in the amounts and at the times anticipated is important to our business success any failure to do so which could result from our inability to successfully execute organizational change and business transformation plans changes in global or regional economic conditions competition changes in the industries in which we compete unanticipated costs or charges loss of key personnel and other factors described herein could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition and results of operations 

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and constantly evolving new entrants to the market existing competitor actions or other changes in market dynamics could adversely impact us 

the level of competition in the retail pharmacy and pharmaceutical wholesale industries is high changes in market dynamics or actions of competitors or manufacturers including industry consolidation and the emergence of new competitors and strategic alliances could materially and adversely impact us disruptive innovation or the perception of potentially disruptive innovation by existing or new competitors could alter the competitive landscape in the future and require us to accurately identify and assess such changes and if required make timely and effective changes to our strategies and business model to compete effectively for example in september 2018 online retailer amazoncom inc acquired pillpack an online pharmacy with licenses throughout the united states some industry analysts have speculated that the pillpack acquisition could provide a platform for amazon to significantly expand into the market for prescription drugs our retail pharmacy businesses face intense competition from local regional national and global companies including other drugstore and pharmacy chains independent drugstores and pharmacies mailorder pharmacies and various other retailers such as grocery stores convenience stores mass merchants online and omnichannel pharmacies and retailers warehouse clubs dollar stores and other discount merchandisers some of which are aggressively expanding in markets we serve businesses in our pharmaceutical wholesale division face intense competition from direct competitors including national and regional cooperative wholesalers and 

 12   

alternative supply sources such as importers and manufacturers who supply directly to pharmacies competition may also come from other sources in the future as competition increases in the markets in which we operate a significant increase in general pricing pressures could occur including pressure on the convenience premium of our retail pricing model which could require us to reevaluate our pricing structures to remain competitive for example if we are not able to anticipate and successfully respond to changes in market conditions in our pharmaceutical wholesale division including changes driven by competitors suppliers or manufacturers and increased competition from national and regional cooperative wholesalers it could result in a loss of customers or renewal of contracts or arrangements on less favorable terms 

we also could be adversely affected if we fail to identify or effectively respond to changes in market dynamics as technology consumer behavior omnichannel and differential retail models and market conditions continue to evolve in the united states it is important that we maintain the relevance of our brand and product and service offerings to customers and patients in recent years we announced that we are testing a number of concepts and initiatives designed to position our stores in the united states as convenient neighborhood health destinations for healthcare and retail products and services the concepts being tested include new approaches to pricing and promotions product selection instore and digital experience and strategic partnerships that bring new products and services to our customers we plan to use these pilots to listen to customers learn and adjust based on feedback with decisions on the nature and extent of further rollouts made over time as we gain experience if our customers are not receptive to these changes if we are unable to expand successful programs in a timely manner or we otherwise do not effectively respond to changes in market dynamics our businesses and financial performance could be materially and adversely affected 

additionally specialty pharmacy represents a significant and growing proportion of prescription drug spending in the united states a significant portion of which is dispensed outside of traditional retail pharmacies because our specialty pharmacy business focuses on complex and highcost medications many of which are made available by manufacturers to a limited number of pharmacies socalled limited distribution drugs that serve a relatively limited universe of patients the future growth of this business depends to a significant extent upon expanding our ability to access key drugs and successfully penetrate key treatment categories accordingly it is important that we and our affiliates compete effectively in this evolving market or our business operations financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected to better serve this evolving market in march 2017 we and prime therapeutics llc a pbm closed a transaction to form a combined central specialty pharmacy and mail services company alliancerx walgreens prime using an innovative model that seeks to align pharmacy pbm and health plans to coordinate patient care improve health outcomes and deliver cost of care opportunities if this joint venture is not able to compete effectively in this evolving market and successfully adapt to changing market conditions our business operations financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

our substantial international business operations subject us to a number of operating economic political regulatory and other international business risks 

our substantial international business operations are important to our growth and prospects including particularly those of our retail pharmacy international and pharmaceutical wholesale divisions and are subject to a number of risks including 

 

 

 

 

 

 13   

 

 

these factors can also adversely affect our payers vendors and customers in international markets which in turn can negatively impact our businesses we cannot assure you that one or more of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations results of operation and financial condition 

many of these factors are subject to change based on changes in political economic and regulatory influences for example 

 

   

there can be no assurance that any or all of these developments will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations results of operations and financial condition 

we are exposed to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

we operate in 25   countries across the globe and our   significant operations outside of the united states expose us to currency exchange rate fluctuations and related risks including transaction currency exposures relating to the import and export of goods in currencies other than businesses’ functional currencies as well as currency translation exposures relating to profits and net assets denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we present our financial statements in us dollars and have a significant proportion of net assets and income in nonus dollar currencies primarily the british pound sterling and the euro as well as a range of other foreign currencies our results of operations and capital ratios can therefore be sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the 

 14   

volatility of currency exchange rates we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future results of operations in addition fluctuations in currencies relative to the us dollar may make it more difficult to perform periodtoperiod comparisons of our reported results of operations a depreciation of nonus dollar currencies relative to the us dollar could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations 

we may from time to time in some instances enter into foreign currency contracts or other derivative instruments intended to hedge a portion of our foreign currency fluctuation risks which subjects us to additional risks such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations to us that could materially and adversely affect us additionally we may and currently do use foreign currency debt to hedge some of our foreign currency fluctuation risks the periodic use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place we cannot assure you that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates including particularly the strengthening of the us dollar against major currencies or the currencies of large developing countries will not materially affect our consolidated financial results 

we may experience a significant disruption in our information technology and computer systems 

we rely extensively on our computer systems to manage our ordering pricing pointofsale pharmacy fulfillment inventory replenishment customer loyalty programs finance and other processes our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages facility damage computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches including credit card or personally identifiable information breaches vandalism natural disasters catastrophic events human error and potential cyber threats including malicious codes worms phishing attacks denial of service attacks ransomware and other sophisticated cyber attacks and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities if any of our systems are damaged fail to function properly or otherwise become unavailable we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience loss or corruption of critical data and interruptions or disruptions and delays in our ability to perform critical functions which could materially and adversely affect our businesses and results of operations 

in addition we are currently making and expect to continue to make substantial investments in our information technology systems and infrastructure some of which are significant upgrades involve replacing existing systems with successor systems outsourcing critical information technology to third parties making changes to existing systems including the migration of applications to the cloud or costeffectively acquiring new systems with new functionality implementing new systems carries significant potential risks including failure to operate as designed potential loss or corruption of data or information changes in security processes cost overruns implementation delays disruption of operations and the potential inability to meet business and reporting requirements we rely on strategic partners and other service providers to help us with certain significant information technology projects and services information technology projects or services frequently are longterm in nature and may take longer to complete and cost more than we expect and may not deliver the benefits we project once they are complete there can be no assurance that we and our strategic partners and service providers will be able to deliver the required functionality of our information technology projects or services within the required timeframe and budget furthermore pursuing multiple initiatives simultaneously could make implementation significantly more challenging we are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems and outsourcing critical information technology functions and there can be no assurance that we will not experience significant issues with our existing systems prior to implementation that our technology initiatives will be successfully deployed as planned or that they will be timely implemented without significant disruption to our operations we also could be adversely affected by any significant disruption in the systems of third parties we interact with including key payers and vendors any system implementation and transition difficulty may result in operational challenges reputational harm and increased costs that could materially and adversely affect our business operations and results of operations 

if we or the businesses we interact with do not maintain the privacy and security of sensitive customer and business information it could damage our reputation and we could suffer a loss of revenue incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation and regulatory scrutiny 

the protection of customer employee and company data is critical to our businesses cybersecurity and other information technology security risks such as a significant breach of customer employee or company data could create significant workflow disruption attract a substantial amount of media attention damage our customer relationships reputation and brand and result in lost sales fines or lawsuits throughout our operations we receive retain and transmit certain personal information that our customers and others provide to purchase products or services fill prescriptions enroll in promotional programs participate in our customer loyalty programs register on our websites or otherwise communicate and interact with us in addition aspects of our operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks like other global companies we and businesses we interact with have experienced threats to data and systems including by perpetrators of random or targeted malicious cyberattacks computer viruses worms bot attacks or other 

 15   

destructive or disruptive software and attempts to misappropriate customer information including credit card information and cause system failures and disruptions any compromise of our data security systems or of those of businesses with whom we interact which results in confidential information being accessed obtained damaged or used by unauthorized or improper persons could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions customer attrition remediation expenses and claims from customers financial institutions payment card associations and other persons any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations financial condition and results of operations because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures in addition a security breach could require that we expend substantial additional resources related to the security of information systems and disrupt our businesses 

we depend on and interact with the information technology networks and systems of thirdparties for many aspects of our business operations including payers strategic partners and cloud service providers these third parties may have access to information we maintain about our company operations customers employees and vendors or operating systems that are critical to or can significantly impact our business operations like us these thirdparties are subject to risks imposed by data breaches and cyberattacks and other events or actions that could damage disrupt or close down their networks or systems any expansion of information technology outsourcing including through arrangements with our strategic partners may increase vulnerabilities and weaknesses relating to cybersecurity and data management security processes protocols and standards that we have implemented and contractual provisions requiring security measures that we may have sought to impose on such thirdparties may not be sufficient or effective at preventing such events which could result in unauthorized access to or disruptions or denials of access to or misuse of information or systems that are important to our business including proprietary information sensitive or confidential data and other information about our operations customers employees and suppliers including personal information 

the regulatory environment surrounding data security and privacy is increasingly demanding with the frequent imposition of new and changing requirements across businesses and geographic areas we are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing data security and privacy regulations in the united states and in other jurisdictions in which we operate that regulate the collection use and transfer of personal data including the transfer of personal data between or among countries in the united states for example hipaa imposes extensive privacy and security requirements governing the transmission use and disclosure of health information by covered entities in the health care industry including health care providers such as pharmacies in addition the california consumer privacy act which goes into effect on january 1 2020 imposes stringent requirements on the use and treatment of “personal information” of california residents which term is broadly defined to include among other things information that identifies relates to describes is capable of being associated with or could reasonably be linked to a consumer or household other us states have enacted or are proposing similar laws related to the protection of personal data in addition the us federal government is considering federal privacy legislation outside the united states many of our business units operate in countries with stringent data protection regulations and these laws continue to change for example the european union’s general data protection regulation which became effective in may 2018 greatly increased the jurisdictional reach of european union data protection laws and added a broad array of requirements for handling personal data including the public disclosure of significant data breaches and provides for greater penalties for noncompliance other countries have enacted or are considering enacting data localization laws that require certain data to stay within their borders complying with changing regulatory requirements requires us to incur substantial costs and may require changes to our business practices in certain jurisdictions any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations and operating results we may also face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations compliance with changes in privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes if we or those with whom we share information fail to comply with these laws and regulations or experience a data security breach our reputation could be damaged and we could be subject to additional litigation and regulatory risks particularly to the extent the breach relates to sensitive data our security measures may be undermined due to the actions of outside parties employee error malfeasance or otherwise and as a result an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate business and personal information any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure damage to our reputation and credibility and potentially have a material adverse effect on our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

a significant change in or noncompliance with governmental regulations and other legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and profitability 

we operate in complex highly regulated environments around the world and could be materially and adversely affected by changes to applicable legal requirements including the related interpretations and enforcement practices new legal requirements andor any failure to comply with applicable regulations businesses in our pharmaceutical wholesale division 

 16   

are subject to a range of regulations relating to such things as product margins product traceability and the conditions under which products must be stored our retail pharmacy and health and wellness services businesses are subject to numerous country state and local regulations including licensing billing practices utilization and other requirements for pharmacies and reimbursement arrangements the regulations to which we are subject include but are not limited to country and state registration and regulation of pharmacies and drug discount card programs dispensing and sale of controlled substances and products containing pseudoephedrine applicable governmental payer regulations including medicare and medicaid data privacy and security laws and regulations including hipaa the aca or any successor thereto laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters each of which continues to evolve including those governing exposure to and the management and disposal of hazardous substances regulations regarding food and drug safety including those of the us food and drug administration “fda” and drug enforcement administration “dea” trade regulations including those of the us federal trade commission and consumer protection and safety regulations including those of the consumer product safety commission as well as state regulatory authorities governing the availability sale advertisement and promotion of products we sell as well as our loyalty and drug discount card programs antikickback laws false claims laws laws against the corporate practice of medicine and foreign national and state laws governing health care fraud and abuse and the practice of the profession of pharmacy for example in the united states the dea fda and various other regulatory authorities regulate the distribution and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances we are required to hold valid dea and statelevel licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with the federal and various state controlled substance acts and related regulations governing the sale dispensing disposal holding and distribution of controlled substances the dea fda and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations we are also governed by foreign national and state laws of general applicability including laws regulating matters of working conditions health and safety and equal employment opportunity and other labor and employment matters as well as employee benefit competition and antitrust matters in addition we could have significant exposure if we are found to have infringed another party’s intellectual property rights 

changes in laws regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may alter the landscape in which we do business and may significantly affect our cost of doing business the impact of new laws regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices generally cannot be predicted and changes in applicable laws regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may require extensive system and operational changes be difficult to implement increase our operating costs and require significant capital expenditures untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties that could adversely affect the continued operation of our businesses including suspension of payments from government programs loss of required government certifications loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government programs including the medicare and medicaid programs in the united states and the national health service in the united kingdom loss of licenses and significant fines or monetary penalties any failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements in the united states or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in significant legal and financial exposure damage to our reputation and brand and have a material adverse effect on our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

we could be adversely affected by violations of antibribery anticorruption andor international trade laws 

we are subject to laws concerning our business operations and marketing activities in foreign countries where we conduct business for example we are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” us export control antimoney laundering and economic and trade sanction laws and similar anticorruption and international trade laws in certain foreign countries such as the uk bribery act any violation of which could create substantial liability for us and also harm our reputation the fcpa generally prohibits us companies and their officers directors employees and intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment the fcpa also requires that us public companies maintain books and records that fairly and accurately reflect transactions and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls if we are found to have violated the fcpa us export control economic and trade sanctions or antimoney laundering laws or any other antibribery anticorruption or international trade laws or to have otherwise conducted business activities inappropriately or unethically including through acts of bribery corruption conflicts of interest fraud manipulation of records or dealings with inappropriate business counterparties or partners we may face penalties sanctions including civil and criminal fines disgorgement of profits and suspension or debarment of our ability to contract with governmental agencies or receive export licenses in addition new initiatives may be proposed from time to time that impact the trading conditions in certain countries or regions and may include retaliatory duties or trade sanctions which if enacted could adversely impact our trading relationships with vendors or other parties in such locations and have a material adverse effect on our operations from time to time we may face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign governmental agencies relating to our international business activities compliance with which could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our 

 17   

business operations an adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could damage our reputation and subject us to fines or other penalties which could materially and adversely affect our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

disruption in our global supply chain could negatively impact our businesses 

the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors and any future disruption in our supply chain or inability to find qualified vendors and access products that meet requisite quality and safety standards in a timely and efficient manner could adversely impact our businesses the loss or disruption of such supply arrangements for any reason including for issues such as labor disputes loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites inability to procure sufficient raw materials quality control issues ethical sourcing issues a supplier’s financial distress natural disasters civil unrest or acts of war or terrorism trade sanctions or other external factors over which we have no control could interrupt product supply and if not effectively managed and remedied have a material adverse impact on our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

we use a single wholesaler of branded and generic pharmaceutical drugs as our primary source of such products for our retail pharmacy usa division 

in march 2013 walgreens alliance boots and amerisourcebergen announced various agreements and arrangements including a tenyear pharmaceutical distribution agreement between walgreens and amerisourcebergen pursuant to which we source branded and generic pharmaceutical products from amerisourcebergen in the united states and an agreement which provides amerisourcebergen the ability to access generic pharmaceutical products through our global sourcing enterprise in may 2016 certain of these agreements were extended for three years to now expire in 2026 in addition in march 2013 walgreens alliance boots and amerisourcebergen entered into agreements and arrangements pursuant to which we have the right but not the obligation to purchase a minority equity position in amerisourcebergen and gain associated representation on amerisourcebergen’s board of directors in certain circumstances as of the date of this report amerisourcebergen distributes for our retail pharmacy usa division substantially all branded and generic pharmaceutical products consequently our business in the united states may be adversely affected by any operational financial or regulatory difficulties that amerisourcebergen experiences for example if amerisourcebergen’s operations are seriously disrupted for any reason whether due to a natural disaster labor disruption regulatory action computer or operational systems or otherwise it could adversely affect our business in the united states and our results of operations 

our distribution agreement with amerisourcebergen is subject to early termination in certain circumstances and upon the expiration or termination of the agreement there can be no assurance that we or amerisourcebergen will be willing to renew the agreement or enter into a new agreement on terms favorable to us or at all if such expiration or termination occurred we believe that alternative sources of supply for most generic and brandname pharmaceuticals are readily available and that we could obtain and qualify alternative sources which may include selfdistribution in some cases for substantially all of the prescription drugs we sell on an acceptable basis such that the impact of any such expiration or termination would be temporary however there can be no assurance we would be able to engage alternative supply sources or implement selfdistribution processes on a timely basis or on terms favorable to us or effectively manage these transitions any of which could adversely affect our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

the anticipated strategic and financial benefits of our relationship with amerisourcebergen may not be realized 

as of august 31 2019  we beneficially owned approximately 27  of the outstanding amerisourcebergen common stock and had designated one member of amerisourcebergen’s board of directors in addition we have the right but not the obligation under the transactions contemplated by the framework agreement dated as of march 18 2013 by and among the company alliance boots and amerisourcebergen the “framework agreement” to acquire up to an additional 8398752  amerisourcebergen shares in the open market and thereafter designate another member of amerisourcebergen’s board of directors subject in each case to applicable legal and contractual requirements there can be no assurance that we will complete any specific level of such potential equity investments in amerisourcebergen or that our existing investment or any future investment if completed will ultimately be profitable 

the company accounts for its investment in amerisourcebergen using the equity method of accounting subject to a twomonth reporting lag with the net earnings attributable to the investment classified within the operating income of the company’s pharmaceutical wholesale segment the financial performance of amerisourcebergen including any charges which may arise relating to its ongoing opioid litigation will impact the company’s results of operations additionally a substantial and sustained decline in the price of amerisourcebergen’s common stock could trigger an impairment evaluation of 

 18   

our investment these considerations may materially and adversely affect the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

further our ability to transact in amerisourcebergen securities is subject to certain restrictions set forth in our agreements with amerisourcebergen and arising under applicable laws and regulations which in some circumstances could adversely our ability to transact in amerisourcebergen securities in amounts and at the times desired we could also encounter unforeseen costs circumstances or issues existing or arising with respect to the transactions and collaboration resulting from these agreements many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs decreased revenue decreased synergies and the diversion of management time and attention if we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame or at all the expected benefits may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of assets from rite aid which could adversely impact our results of operations 

we entered into an agreement to acquire certain rite aid stores and distribution centers with the expectation that the transaction will result in various benefits including among other things cost savings and operating efficiencies the achievement of the anticipated benefits of the transaction is subject to a number of uncertainties including completion of the pending acquisition of distribution centers and related inventory expected to be completed during fiscal 2020 whether the acquired assets can be integrated into our business in an efficient and effective manner the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding potential synergies and the integration process unforeseen expenses or delays and competitive factors in the marketplace we can provide no assurance that the anticipated benefits of the transaction including cost savings and synergies will be fully realized in the time frame anticipated or at all the costs or difficulties related to the integration of the acquired assets into our business and operations will not be greater than expected unanticipated costs charges and expenses will not result from the transaction litigation relating to the transaction will not be filed and the transaction will not cause disruption to the parties’ business and operations and relationships with employees and suppliers payers customers and other third parties if one or more of these risks are realized it could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 

from time to time we make investments in companies over which we do not have sole control some of these companies may operate in sectors that differ from our current operations and have different risks 

from time to time we make debt or equity investments in companies that we may not control or over which we may not have sole control for example while we have a significant equity investment in amerisourcebergen and have a designee serving on the board of directors of amerisourcebergen as of the date of this report we do not have the ability to control daytoday operations of that company some of the businesses in which we have made noncontrolling investments operate in markets or industries that are different from our primary lines of business andor operate in different geographic markets than we do for example we have an equity investment in sinopharm holding guoda drugstores co ltd a leading retail pharmacy chain in china investments in these businesses among other risks subject us to the operating and financial risks of the businesses we invest in and to the risk that we do not have sole control over the operations of these businesses we rely on the internal controls and financial reporting controls of these entities and their failure to maintain effectiveness or comply with applicable standards may materially and adversely affect us investments in entities over which we do not have sole control including joint ventures and strategic partnerships and alliances present additional risks such as having differing objectives from our partners or the entities in which we are invested becoming involved in disputes or competing with those persons 

changes in economic conditions could adversely affect consumer buying practices 

our performance has been and may continue to be adversely impacted by changes in global national regional or local economic conditions and consumer confidence these conditions can also adversely affect our key vendors and customers external factors that affect consumer confidence and over which we exercise no influence include unemployment rates inflation levels of personal disposable income levels of taxes and interest and global national regional or local economic conditions as well as acts of war or terrorism changes in economic conditions and consumer confidence could adversely affect consumer preferences purchasing power and spending patterns which could lead to a decrease in overall consumer spending as well as in prescription drug and health services utilization and which could be exacerbated by the increasing prevalence of highdeductible health insurance plans and related plan design changes our business operations have been adversely affected by challenging market conditions in our retail pharmacy international division particularly our boots business in the united kingdom on account of the economic environment including the uncertainty associated with brexit 

 19   

in addition reduced or flat consumer spending may drive us and our competitors to offer additional products at promotional prices all of these factors could materially and adversely impact our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

economic conditions in europe and certain emerging market countries together with austerity measures being taken by certain governments could adversely affect us 

we have significant assets and operations within europe and certain emerging market countries in our retail pharmacy international and pharmaceutical wholesale divisions an economic slowdown within any such markets could adversely affect our businesses in affected regions by reducing the prices our customers may be able or willing to pay for our products and services or by reducing the demand for our products and services either of which could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations in recent years in response to the economic environment a number of governments including the government in the united kingdom have announced or implemented austerity measures to reduce healthcare spending for the governmentsponsored healthcare systems and constrain overall government expenditures these measures which include efforts aimed at reforming healthcare coverage and reducing healthcare costs continue to exert pressure on the pricing of and reimbursement timelines for pharmaceutical drugs any new austerity measures may be similar to or vary in scope and nature from existing austerity measures and could have a material adverse effect on our international business operations and results of operations 

if we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant omnichannel experience for our customers our businesses and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

the portion of total consumer expenditures with retailers occurring online and through mobile applications has continued to increase and the pace of this increase could accelerate in the future our business has evolved from an instore experience to interaction with customers across numerous channels including instore online mobile and social media among others omnichannel and differentiated retail models are rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing customer expectations and new developments by our competitors our customers are increasingly using computers tablets mobile phones and other devices to comparison shop determine product availability and complete purchases as well as to provide immediate public reactions regarding various facets of our operations we must compete by offering a consistent and convenient shopping experience for our customers regardless of the ultimate sales channel and by investing in providing and maintaining digital tools for our customers that have the right features and are reliable and easy to use if we are unable to make improve or develop relevant customerfacing technology in a timely manner that keeps pace with technological developments and dynamic customer expectations our ability to compete and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected in addition if our online activities or our other customerfacing technology systems do not function as designed we may experience a loss of customer confidence data security breaches lost sales or be exposed to fraudulent purchases any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations reputation and results of operations 

if the merchandise and services that we offer fail to meet customer needs our sales may be adversely affected 

we could be adversely affected by changes in consumer spending levels and shopping habits and preferences including attitudes towards our retail and product brands the success of our retail pharmacy businesses depends on our ability to offer a superior shopping experience engaging customer service and a quality assortment of available merchandise that differentiates us from other retailers including enhanced health and beauty product offerings we must identify obtain supplies of and offer to our customers attractive innovative and highquality merchandise on a continuous basis our products and services must satisfy the needs and desires of our customers whose preferences may change in the future for example our proof of concept initiatives that seek to position our stores in the united states as convenient neighborhood health destinations for healthcare and retail products and services reflect the perceived desires and needs of our target market however it is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand if we misjudge either the demand for products and services we sell or our customers’ purchasing habits and tastes we may be faced with excess inventories of some products and missed opportunities for products and services we chose not to offer in addition our sales may decline or we may be required to sell the merchandise we have obtained at lower prices failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences and spending patterns and evolving demographic mixes in the markets we serve could negatively affect our relationship with our customers and the demand for our products and services which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations 

our private brand offerings expose us to various additional risks 

in addition to brand name products we offer our customers private brand products that in many instances are not available from other retailers we seek to continue to grow our private brand offerings as part of our growth strategy including through 

 20   

the offering of no7 the introduction of complete home and other brands owned or licensed on an exclusive basis as well as through selective acquisitions maintaining consistent product quality competitive pricing and availability of our private brand offerings for our customers as well as the timely development and introduction of new products is important in differentiating us from other retailers and developing and maintaining customer loyalty the expansion of our private brand offerings also subjects us to additional risks such as potential product liability risks and mandatory or voluntary product recalls our ability to successfully protect our proprietary rights and successfully navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties our ability to successfully administer and comply with applicable contractual obligations and regulatory requirements and other risks generally encountered by entities that source sell and market exclusive branded offerings for retail an increase in sales of our private brands may also adversely affect sales of our vendors’ products which in turn could adversely affect our relationship with certain of our vendors any failure to adequately address some or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business operations results of operations and financial condition 

we face significant competition in attracting and retaining talented employees further managing succession for and retention of key executives is critical to our success and failure to do so could have an adverse impact on our future performance 

  

our ability to attract engage and retain qualified and experienced employees including in executive and other key strategic positions is essential to meet current and future goals and objectives and there is no guarantee we will be able to attract and retain such employees by offering market competitive compensation opportunities empowerment and resources there can be no assurance that competition among potential employers will not result in increased salaries or other benefits an inability to retain existing employees or attract additional employees or an unexpected loss of leadership or loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

  

in addition failure to adequately plan for succession of senior management and other key management roles or the failure of key employees to successfully transition into new roles could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations while we have succession plans in place and employment arrangements with certain key executives these do not guarantee the services of these executives will continue to be available to us 

we are subject to paymentrelated and other financial services risks that could increase our operating costs expose us to fraud or theft subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business operations 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including cash checks credit and debit cards gift cards and mobile payment technologies such as apple pay™ and we may offer new payment options over time acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules regulations contractual obligations and compliance requirements including payment network rules and operating guidelines data security standards and certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers these requirements and related interpretations may change over time which could make compliance more difficult or costly for certain payment methods including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which could increase over time and raise our operating costs we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards and other forms of electronic payment if these companies become unable to provide these services to us or if their systems are compromised it could disrupt our business the payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by persons who seek to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit any weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems if we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements or if data is compromised due to a breach or misuse of data relating to our payment systems we may be liable for costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments could be impaired in addition our reputation could suffer and our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types which could result in higher costs andor reduced sales and materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

additionally we offer money wire transfer services and sell prepaid debit credit and gift cards at certain business units these products and services require us to comply with global antimoney laundering laws and regulations failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines sanctions penalties and damage to our reputation 

changes in healthcare regulatory environments may adversely affect our businesses 

political economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to significant changes that could adversely affect our results of operations in recent years the healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to reduce costs and government spending these changes include an increased reliance on managed care cuts in certain medicare and medicaid funding in the united states and the funding of governmental payers in foreign jurisdictions consolidation of competitors suppliers and other market participants and the development of large sophisticated purchasing groups we expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future some of these potential changes such as a reduction in 

 21   

governmental funding for certain healthcare services or adverse changes in legislation or regulations governing prescription drug pricing healthcare services or mandated benefits may cause customers to reduce the amount of our products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services we expect continued governmental and private payer pressure to reduce pharmaceutical pricing changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers’ pricing or distribution policies could also significantly reduce our profitability 

in the united states electoral results and changes in political leadership have generated uncertainty with respect to and could result in significant changes in legislation regulation and government policy that could significantly impact our businesses and the health care and retail industries there have been multiple attempts to repeal modify or otherwise invalidate all or certain provisions of the aca which was enacted in 2010 to provide health insurance coverage to millions of previously uninsured americans through a combination of insurance market reforms an expansion of medicaid subsidies and health insurance mandates we cannot predict whether current or future efforts to modify these laws andor adopt new healthcare legislation will be successful nor can we predict the impact that such a development would have on our business and operating results future legislation or rulemaking or other regulatory actions or developments under the aca or otherwise could adversely impact the number of americans with health insurance and consequently prescription drug coverage increase regulation of pharmacy services result in changes to pharmacy reimbursement rates and otherwise change the way we do business we cannot predict the timing or impact of any future legislative rulemaking or other regulatory actions but any such actions could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

we could be adversely affected by product liability product recall personal injury or other health and safety issues 

we could be adversely impacted by the supply of defective or expired products including the infiltration of counterfeit products into the supply chain errors in relabeling of products product tampering product recall and contamination or product mishandling issues through our pharmacies and specialist packaging sites including through services provided by thirdparty health care providers we are also exposed to risks relating to the services we offer errors in the dispensing and packaging of pharmaceuticals including related counseling and in the provision of other healthcare services could lead to serious injury or death product liability or personal injury claims may be asserted against us with respect to any of the products or pharmaceuticals we sell or services we provide for example from time to time the fda issues statements alerting patients that products in our supply chain may contain impurities or harmful substances and claims relating to the sale or distribution of such products may be asserted against us or arise from these statements our healthcare clinics also increase our exposure to professional liability claims related to medical care should a product or other liability issue arise the coverage limits under our insurance programs and the indemnification amounts available to us may not be adequate to protect us against claims and judgments we also may not be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms in the future we could suffer significant reputational damage and financial liability if we or any affiliated entities or thirdparty healthcare providers that we do business with experience any of the foregoing health and safety issues or incidents which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

we have significant outstanding debt our debt and associated payment obligations could significantly increase in the future if we incur additional debt and do not retire existing debt 

we have outstanding debt and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity as of august 31 2019  we had approximately 17 billion  of outstanding indebtedness including shortterm debt our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including 

 

 

 

 

we may incur or assume significantly more debt in the future including in connection with acquisitions strategic investments or joint ventures if we add new debt and do not retire existing debt the risks described above could increase 

 22   

we also could be adversely impacted by any failure to renew or replace on terms acceptable to us or at all existing funding arrangements when they expire and any failure to satisfy applicable covenants 

additionally a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at fluctuating interest rates some of which is tied to the london interbank offered rate for deposits of us dollars “libor” libor tends to fluctuate based on general interest rates rates set by the federal reserve and other central banks the supply of and demand for credit in the london interbank market and general economic conditions in july 2017 the united kingdom financial conduct authority which regulates libor announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 the expected phase out of libor could cause market volatility or disruption and may adversely affect our access to the capital markets and cost of funding 

our longterm debt obligations include covenants that may adversely affect our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur certain secured indebtedness or engage in certain types of transactions in addition our existing credit agreements require us to maintain as of the last day of each fiscal quarter a ratio of consolidated debt to total capitalization not to exceed a certain level our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants may be affected by events beyond our control if we breach any of these restrictions or covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable this could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition 

we could be adversely affected by downgrades to our credit ratings or disruptions in our ability to access wellfunctioning capital markets 

historically we have relied on the public debt capital markets to fund portions of our capital investments and access to the commercial paper market and bank credit facilities as part of our working capital management strategy our continued access to these markets and the terms of such access depend on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets our operating performance and our credit ratings the major credit rating agencies have assigned us and our corporate debt investment grade credit ratings these ratings are based on a number of factors which include their assessment of our financial strength and financial policies we benefit from investment grade ratings as they serve to lower our borrowing costs and facilitate our access to a variety of lenders and other creditors including landlords for our leased stores on terms that we consider advantageous to our businesses however there can be no assurance that any particular rating assigned to us will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency if in that rating agency’s judgment future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating so warrant for more information on our ratings see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources  credit ratings” incurrence of additional debt by us and our operating performance could adversely affect our credit ratings we depend on banks and other financial institutions to provide credit to our business and perform under our agreements with them defaults by one or more of these counterparties on their obligations to us could materially and adversely affect us any disruptions or turmoil in the capital markets or any downgrade of our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets and increase the cost of and counterparty risks associated with existing facilities which could materially and adversely affect our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

we may be unable to keep existing store locations or open new locations in desirable places on favorable terms which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores local land use and zoning regulations environmental regulations and other regulatory requirements may impact our ability to find suitable locations and influence the cost of constructing renovating and operating our stores in addition real estate zoning construction and other delays may adversely affect store openings and renovations and increase our costs further changing local demographics at existing store locations may adversely affect revenue and profitability levels at those stores the termination or expiration of leases at existing store locations may adversely affect us if the renewal terms of those leases are unacceptable to us and we are forced to close or relocate stores for example in fiscal 2019 we announced the closure of approximately 200 locations in the united states and approximately 200 stores in the united kingdom respectively under our transformational cost management program if we determine to close or relocate a store subject to a lease we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for the balance of the lease term if we are unable to maintain our existing store locations or open new locations in desirable places and on favorable terms our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

as a holding company walgreens boots alliance is dependent on funding from its operating subsidiaries to pay dividends and other obligations 

 23   

walgreens boots alliance is a holding company with no business operations of its own its assets primarily consist of direct and indirect ownership interests in and its business is conducted through subsidiaries which are separate legal entities as a result it is dependent on funding from its subsidiaries including walgreens and alliance boots to meet its obligations additionally walgreens boots alliance’s subsidiaries may be restricted in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions to walgreens boots alliance which may limit the payment of cash dividends or other distributions to the holders of walgreens boots alliance common stock credit facilities and other debt obligations of walgreens boots alliance as well as statutory provisions may further limit the ability of walgreens boots alliance and its subsidiaries to pay dividends payments to walgreens boots alliance by its subsidiaries are also contingent upon its subsidiaries’ earnings and business considerations future walgreens boots alliance dividends will be determined based on earnings capital requirements financial condition and other factors considered relevant by its board of directors 

our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly 

our operating results have historically varied on a quarterly basis including increased variability in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future factors that may affect our quarterly operating results some of which are beyond the control of management include but are not limited to the timing of the introduction of new generic and brand name prescription drugs inflation including with respect to generic drug procurement costs seasonality including the timing and severity of the cough cold and flu season changes or rates of change in payer reimbursement rates and terms fluctuations in inventory energy transportation labor healthcare and other costs significant acquisitions dispositions joint ventures and other strategic initiatives asset impairment charges including the performance of and impairment charges related to our equity method investments the relative magnitude of our lifo provision in any particular quarter foreign currency fluctuations market conditions including any impact relating to brexit prolonged severe weather in key markets and many of the other risk factors discussed herein accordingly we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and investors should not place undue reliance on the results of any particular quarter as an indication of our future performance 

our businesses are seasonal in nature and adverse events during the holiday and cough cold and flu seasons could adversely impact our operating results 

our businesses are seasonal in nature with the second fiscal quarter december january and february typically generating a higher proportion of retail sales and earnings than other fiscal quarters we purchase significant amounts of seasonal inventory in anticipation of the holiday season adverse events such as deteriorating economic conditions higher unemployment higher gas prices public transportation disruptions or unanticipated adverse weather could result in lowerthanplanned sales during key selling seasons for example frequent or unusually heavy snowfall ice storms rainstorms windstorms or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period could make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and increase our snow removal and other costs this could lead to lower sales or to unanticipated markdowns negatively impacting our financial condition and results of operations in addition both prescription and nonprescription drug sales are affected by the timing and severity of the cough cold and flu season which can vary considerably from year to year 

we could be adversely impacted by changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters 

generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our businesses including but not limited to revenue recognition asset impairment impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets inventories equity method investments vendor rebates and other vendor consideration lease obligations selfinsurance liabilities pension and postretirement benefits tax matters unclaimed property laws and litigation and other contingent liabilities are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition for example changes in accounting standards and the application of existing accounting standards particularly related to the measurement of fair value as compared to carrying value for the company’s reporting units including goodwill intangible assets and investments in equity interests may have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include significant adverse changes in the business climate and declines in the financial condition of a reporting unit factors that could lead to impairment of investments in equity interests of the companies in which we invested include a prolonged period of decline in their operating performance or adverse changes in the economic regulatory and legal environments of the countries in which they operate 

 24   

new accounting guidance also may require changes to our processes accounting systems and internal controls that could increase our operating costs andor significantly change our financial statements for example in february 2016 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu” 201602 leases topic 842 which supersedes topic 840 leases this asu which became effective for us beginning on september 1 2019 fiscal 2020 seeks to increase the transparency and comparability of organizations by recognizing operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements the adoption approach for these accounting standards affect the comparability of our consolidated financial statements implementing new accounting guidance may require us to make significant changes to and investments in our accounting systems and processes which could result in significant adverse changes to our financial statements see “new accounting pronouncements” within note 1  summary of major accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements 

we have a substantial amount of goodwill and other intangible assets which could in the future become impaired and result in material noncash charges to our results of operations 

as of august 31 2019  we had 274 billion  of goodwill and other intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheets we evaluate this goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that could more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinitelived intangible asset below its carrying value as part of this impairment analysis we determine fair value for each reporting unit using both the income and market approaches we determine fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets using the relief from royalty method and excess earnings method of the income approach definitelived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable estimated fair values could change if for example there are changes in the business climate changes in the competitive environment adverse legal or regulatory actions or developments changes in capital structure cost of debt and equity capital expenditure levels operating cash flows or market capitalization for example during the three months ended august 31 2019 we completed quantitative impairment analysis for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets as of a june 1 2019 valuation date based on this analysis the fair value of the boots reporting unit within the retail pharmacy international segment is in excess of its carrying value by approximately 9  as at august 31 2019  the carrying value of the goodwill of the boots reporting unit is 26 billion  the fair values of certain indefinitelived intangibles within the boots reporting unit exceeded their carrying amounts ranging from approximately 3  to approximately 29  except for the pharmacy licenses as at august 31 2019  the carrying value of these indefinitelived intangibles within boots reporting unit is 69 billion  as a result of an annual evaluation during the three months ended august 31 2019  the company recorded an impairment of 73 million  on its pharmacy licenses in the boots reporting unit because of the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets any future impairment of these assets could result in material noncash charges to our results of operations which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we could be subject to adverse changes in tax laws regulations and interpretations or challenges to our tax positions 

we are a large corporation with operations in the united states and numerous other jurisdictions around the world as such we are subject to tax laws and regulations of the us federal state and local governments as well as various foreign jurisdictions we compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate as the tax rates vary among jurisdictions a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision 

from time to time changes in tax laws or regulations may be proposed or enacted that could adversely affect our overall tax liability for example the us tax legislation enacted on december 22 2017 represented a significant overhaul of the us federal tax code that impacted our us federal income tax position there can be no assurance that changes in tax laws or regulations both within the united states and the other jurisdictions in which we operate will not materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate tax payments financial condition and results of operations similarly changes in tax laws and regulations that impact our customers and counterparties or the economy generally may also impact our financial condition and results of operations 

tax laws and regulations are complex and subject to varying interpretations and we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative impact on our effective tax rate tax payments financial condition and results of operations in addition the determination of our income tax provision and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain the ultimate tax determination may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our results of operations in the period or periods for which such determination is made any significant failure to comply with applicable tax laws and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions could give rise to substantial penalties and liabilities any changes in enacted tax laws such as the recent us tax legislation rules or regulatory 

 25   

or judicial interpretations or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could materially and adversely impact our effective tax rate tax payments financial condition and results of operations 

our insurance strategies may expose us to unexpected costs 

we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance to provide for potential liability for workers’ compensation automobile and general liability property director and officers’ liability and employee healthcare benefits provisions for losses related to selfinsured risks generally are based upon actuarially determined estimates any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability substantial unanticipated losses or liabilities including those due to natural disasters or otherwise as well as changes in legal claims trends and interpretations variability in inflation rates changes in the nature and method of claims settlement benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws insolvency of insurance carriers and changes in discount rates could all materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we could be adversely impacted by changes in assumptions used in calculating pension assets and liabilities 

we operate certain defined benefit pension plans in the united kingdom which were closed to new entrants in 2010 as well as smaller plans in other jurisdictions the valuation of the pension plans’ assets and liabilities depends in part on assumptions which are primarily based on the financial markets as well as longevity and employee retention rates this valuation is particularly sensitive to material changes in the value of equity bond and other investments held by the pension plans changes in the corporate bond yields which are used in the measurement of the liabilities changes in market expectations for longterm price inflation and new evidence on projected longevity rates funding requirements and the impact on the statement of earnings relating to these pension plans are also influenced by these factors adverse changes in the assumptions used to calculate the value of pension assets and liabilities including lower than expected pension fund investment returns andor increased life expectancy of plan participants or regulatory change could require us to increase the funding of its defined benefit pension plans or incur higher expenses which would adversely impact our results of operations and financial position 

certain stockholders may have significant voting influence over matters requiring stockholder approval 

as of september 30 2019 affiliates of stefano pessina our executive vice chairman and chief executive officer the “sp investors” had sole or shared voting power directly or indirectly over an aggregate of approximately 162 of our outstanding common stock the sp investors have agreed to for so long as they have the right to designate a nominee for election to the board to vote all of their shares of common stock in accordance with the board’s recommendation on matters submitted to a vote of the company’s stockholders including with respect to the election of directors the sp investors’ significant interest in our common stock potentially could determine the outcome of matters submitted to a vote by our stockholders the influence of the sp investors could result in the company taking actions that other stockholders do not support or failing to take actions that other stockholders support as a result the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected 

conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest may arise because certain of our directors and officers are also owners or directors of companies we may have dealings with 

conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest could arise between our interests and the interests of the other entities and business activities in which our directors or officers are involved for example potential conflicts of interest could arise if a dispute were to arise between the company and other parties to the company shareholders agreement as defined herein including the sp investors mr pessina our executive vice chairman and chief executive officer indirectly controls alliance santé participations sa “asp” a privatelyheld company which is a party to the company shareholders agreement and he and his partner ornella barra our cochief operating officer serve as directors of asp there are other arrangements between affiliates of mr pessina and the company with required disclosures included in the company’s annual proxy statement including with respect to alliance healthcare italia spa which is an entity indirectly owned and controlled by mr pessina and in which the company has an indirect 9 interest which operates boots branded stores in italy conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest or similar issues could arise in connection with these or other transactions in the future while our contractual arrangements place restrictions on the parties’ conduct in certain situations and related party transactions are subject to independent review and approval in accordance with our related party transaction approval procedures and applicable law the potential for a conflict of interest exists and such persons may have conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting both companies 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws delaware law andor our agreements with certain stockholders may impede the ability of our stockholders to make changes to our board or impede a takeover 

 26   

certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as provisions of the delaware general corporation law the “dgcl” could make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the board or discourage delay or prevent a merger consolidation or acquisitions that stockholders may otherwise consider favorable these provisions include the authorization of the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that could be issued by the board limitations on the ability of stockholders to call special meetings and advance notice requirements for nomination for election to the board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings we are also subject to the provisions of section 203 of the dgcl which prohibits us except under specified circumstances from engaging in any mergers significant sales of stock or assets or business combinations with any stockholder or group of stockholders who own 15 or more of our common stock 

under the company shareholders agreement the sp investors are entitled to designate one nominee to the board currently stefano pessina for so long as the sp investors continue to meet certain beneficial ownership thresholds and subject to certain other conditions pursuant to the company shareholders agreement the sp investors have agreed that for so long as they have the right to designate a nominee to the board they will vote all of their shares of common stock in accordance with the board’s recommendation on matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders including with respect to the election of directors 

while these provisions do not make us immune from takeovers or changes in the composition of the board and are intended to protect our stockholders from among other things coercive or otherwise unfair tactics these provisions could have the effect of making it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the board or discouraging delaying or preventing a merger consolidation or acquisitions that stockholders may otherwise consider favorable 

we cannot guarantee that our stock repurchase program will be fully implemented or that it will enhance longterm stockholder value 

in june 2018 our board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to 10 billion of our common stock the repurchase program does not have an expiration date and we are not obligated to repurchase a specified number or dollar value of shares on any particular timetable or at all there can be no assurance that we will repurchase stock at favorable prices the repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time and even if fully implemented may not enhance longterm stockholder value

us tax law changes 

in connection with the us tax law changes enacted in december 2017 and in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin 118 the company completed its analysis of the income tax effects of the us tax law changes during the three months ended february 28 2019 the incremental net tax benefit recorded upon completion of the analysis of the income tax effects of the us tax law changes was not material to our consolidated financial statements 

while the company completed its analysis of the income tax effects of the us tax law changes the final impact of the us tax law changes may differ from this analysis due to among other things technical clarifications from the us department of the treasury and the internal revenue service “irs” interpretations of the us tax law changes and actions the company may take the company will continue to evaluate the impact of any future authoritative guidance with respect to the us tax law changes 

during 2019 the us treasury department issued regulations to apply retroactively covering certain components of the 2017 us tax law changes certain guidance included in these regulations is inconsistent with the company’s interpretation that led to the recognition of 247 million  of tax benefits in prior periods despite this new guidance the company remains confident in its interpretation of the us tax law changes and intends to defend this position through litigation if necessary however if the company is ultimately unsuccessful in defending its position it may be required to reverse all or a portion of the benefits previously recorded 

as the company repatriates the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries for use in the united states the earnings from our foreign subsidiaries will generally not be subject to us federal tax the company continuously evaluates the amount of foreign earnings that are not necessary to be permanently reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries 

investment in amerisourcebergen 

 37   

as of august 31 2019  the company owned 56854867  shares of amerisourcebergen common stock representing approximately 27  of its outstanding common stock and may subject to certain conditions acquire up to an additional 8398752  amerisourcebergen shares in the open market 

the company accounts for its investment in amerisourcebergen using the equity method of accounting subject to a twomonth reporting lag with the net earnings attributable to the investment classified within the operating income of the company’s pharmaceutical wholesale segment the financial performance of amerisourcebergen including any charges which may arise relating to its ongoing opioid litigation will impact the company’s results of operations additionally a substantial and sustained decline in the price of amerisourcebergen’s common stock could trigger an impairment evaluation of our investment these considerations may materially and adversely affect the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

for more information see “business  relationship with amerisourcebergen” and note 5  equity method investments  to the consolidated financial statements 

the impact of brexit 

in june 2016 voters in the united kingdom approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the european union which proposed exit and the political economic and other uncertainties it has raised is commonly referred to as “brexit” since the brexit vote in june 2016 there has been significant volatility in the global stock markets and currency exchange rates as well as challenging market conditions in the united kingdom in march 2017 the united kingdom formally started the process to leave the european union an original exit date was set for march 29 2019 but following the uk parliament’s rejection of a negotiated outcome the leaders of the member countries of the european union have agreed to multiple extensions of the deadline for brexit and there can be no assurance regarding the terms timing or consummation of any such arrangements although we continue to actively monitor the ongoing potential impacts of brexit and will seek to minimize its impact on our business if the uk’s membership in the european union terminates without an agreement these conditions could continue and there could be increased costs from tariffs on trade between the united kingdom and european union and disruptions to the free movement of goods services and people between the united kingdom and the european union and other parties further uncertainty around and developments regarding these and related issues has contributed to deteriorating market conditions and could further adversely impact consumer and investor confidence and the economy of the united kingdom and the economies of other countries in which we operate and cause significant volatility in currency exchange rates given the lack of comparable precedent it is unclear what financial trade regulatory and legal implications the withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union will have on our business particularly european operations however brexit and its related effects could have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial position or operating results for more information relating to this topic see “risk factorsour substantial international business operations subject us to a number of operating economic political regulatory and other international business risks ”

critical accounting policies 

the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and include amounts based on management’s prudent judgments and estimates actual results may differ from these estimates management believes that any reasonable deviation from those judgments and estimates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations to the extent that the estimates used differ from actual results however adjustments to the consolidated statements of earnings and corresponding consolidated balance sheets accounts would be necessary these adjustments would be made in future periods some of the more significant estimates include business combinations goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment cost of sales and inventory equity method investments pension and postretirement benefits and income taxes the company uses the following methods to determine its estimates 

  

business combinations   –  the company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that once control is obtained all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition the determination of fair values of assets and liabilities acquired requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available 

for intangible assets the company generally uses the income approach to determine fair value the income approach requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions primarily include but are not limited to discount rates terminal growth rates royalty rates forecasts of revenue operating income depreciation amortization and capital expenditures the discount rates applied to the projections reflect the risk factors associated with those projections 

although the company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on the determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired 

judgment is also required in determining the intangible asset’s useful life 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment  – goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that could more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or intangible asset below its carrying value as part of the company’s impairment analysis fair value of a reporting unit is determined using both the income and market approaches the income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit including projected future operating results economic projections anticipated future cash flows and discount rates the market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping 

the determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires the company to make significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions primarily include but are not limited to the selection of appropriate peer group companies control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we compete discount rates terminal growth rates forecasts of revenue operating income depreciation amortization and capital expenditures although we believe our estimates of fair value are reasonable actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units the amount of any goodwill impairment charge or both 

the company also compares the sum of estimated fair values of reporting units to the company’s fair value as implied by the market value of its equity securities this comparison provides an indication that in total assumptions and estimates are reasonable future declines in the overall market value of the company’s equity securities may provide an indication that the fair value of one or more reporting units has declined below its carrying value 

 52   

the fair values of the company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts ranging from approximately 9  to approximately 269  as of june 1 2019 valuation date the fair value of the boots reporting unit in the retail pharmacy international division is in excess of its carrying value by approximately 9  as at august 31 2019  the carrying value of the goodwill of the boots reporting unit is 26 billion  

the company continues to closely monitor industry and market trends and the impact it may have on the boots reporting unit and indefinitelived intangibles as the challenging market conditions in the uk continued to impact the operating performance of the boots reporting unit during the three months ended august 31 2019  

  

indefinitelived intangible assets are tested by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value indefinitelived intangible assets fair values are estimated using the relief from royalty method and excess earnings method of the income approach these estimates can be affected by a number of factors including but not limited to general economic conditions availability of market information as well as our profitability the fair values of indefinitelived intangibles within the boots reporting unit exceeded their carrying value amounts ranging from approximately 3 to approximately 29 except for the pharmacy licenses as at august 31 2019  the carrying value of these indefinitelived intangibles within the boots reporting unit is 69 billion  during the fiscal year ended august 31 2019 the company recorded an impairment of 73 million on its pharmacy licenses in the boots reporting unit which was included in selling general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of earnings 

see note 6  goodwill and other intangible assets  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

cost of sales and inventory  – cost of sales includes the purchase price of goods and cost of services rendered store and warehouse inventory loss inventory obsolescence and supplier rebates in addition to product costs cost of sales includes warehousing costs for retail operations purchasing costs freight costs cash discounts and vendor allowances 

cost of sales for our retail pharmacy usa segment is derived based upon pointofsale scanning information with an estimate for shrinkage and is adjusted based on periodic inventory counts inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market determined by the lastin firstout “lifo” method for the retail pharmacy usa segment and primarily on a firstin firstout “fifo” basis for inventory in the retail pharmacy international and pharmaceutical wholesale segments 

  

equity method investments   – the company uses the equity method of accounting for equity investments in companies if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence but not control over operating and financial policies of the investee the company’s proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies is included in consolidated net earnings judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as the company’s ownership interest legal form of the investee eg limited liability partnership representation on the board of directors participation in policymaking decisions and material intraentity transactions 

the company evaluates equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable factors considered by the company when reviewing an equity method investment for impairment include the length of time duration and the extent severity to which the fair value of the equity method investment has been less than cost the investee’s financial condition and nearterm prospects and the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery an impairment that is otherthantemporary is recognized in the period identified 

  

pension and postretirement benefits  – the company has various defined benefit pension plans that cover some of its nonus employees the company also has a postretirement healthcare plan that covers qualifying us employees eligibility and the level of benefits for these plans vary depending on participants’ status date of hire and or length of service pension and postretirement plan expenses and valuations are dependent on assumptions used by thirdparty actuaries in calculating those amounts these assumptions include discount rates healthcare cost trends longterm return on plan assets retirement rates mortality rates and other factors   

in determining longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption the company considers both the historical performance of the investment portfolio as well as the longterm market return expectations based on the investment mix of the portfolio a change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on its pension expense a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in a decline of 3681 million to the company’s pension benefit obligation a 25 basis point decrease on the expected return on plan assets assumption would increase the company’s pension expense by 191 million 

 53   

 the company funds its pension plans in accordance with applicable regulations the postretirement healthcare plan is not funded 

  

income taxes  – the company is subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business us federal state local and foreign tax authorities raise questions regarding the company’s tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions in evaluating the tax benefits associated with the various tax filing positions the company records a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized adjustments are made to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which the company determines the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities the statute of limitations expires for the return containing the tax position or when more information becomes available  the liability for unrecognized tax benefits including accrued penalties and interest is primarily included in other noncurrent liabilities and current income taxes on the company’s consolidated balance sheets and in income tax provision in its consolidated statements of earnings 

  

in determining its provision for income taxes the company uses income permanent differences between book and tax income and enacted statutory income tax rates the provision for income taxes rate also reflects its assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits in addition to any foreignbased income deemed to be taxable in the united states discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

interest rate risk 

the company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to existing variablerate debt instruments and future incurrences of fixed or variablerate debt which exposure primarily relates to movements in various interest rates such as us treasury rates and commercial paper rates from time to time the company uses interest rate swaps and forwardstarting interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to the impact of interest rate changes on existing debt and future debt issuances respectively to reduce the volatility of financing costs and based on current and projected market conditions achieve a desired proportion of fixedrate versus floatingrate debt generally under these swaps the company agrees with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixedrate and floatingrate interest amounts based on an agreed upon notional principal amount 

information regarding the company’s transactions are set forth in note 8  financial instruments  to the consolidated financial statements these financial instruments are sensitive to changes in interest rates on august 31 2019  the company had no material longterm debt obligations that had floating interest rates the amounts exclude the impact of any associated derivative contracts 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily with respect to the british pound sterling and euro   and certain other foreign currencies which may affect its net investment in foreign subsidiaries and may cause fluctuations in cash flows related to foreign denominated transactions the company is also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the us dollar the company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on nonfunctional currency cash flows these transactions are almost exclusively less than 12 months in maturity in addition the company enters into foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated in hedging relationships to offset in part the impacts of certain intercompany activities primarily associated with intercompany financing transactions under certain market conditions the company may seek to protect against possible declines in the reported net investments of our foreign subsidiaries by using foreign currency crosscurrency swaps foreign currency forwardexchange contracts or foreign currency debt 

the company’s foreign currency derivative instruments are sensitive to changes in exchange rates a hypothetical 1 change in foreign currency exchange rates versus the us dollar would change the fair value of the foreign currency derivatives held as of august 31 2019  by approximately 22 million the foreign currency derivatives are intended to partially hedge anticipated transactions foreign currency trade payables and receivables and net investments in foreign subsidiaries

industry overview 

the retail pharmacy and pharmaceutical wholesale industries across the globe are highly competitive and dynamic and have experienced consolidation and an evolving competitive landscape in recent years prescription drugs play a significant role in healthcare and constitute a first line of treatment for many medical conditions the company believes the longterm outlook for prescription drug utilization is strong due in part to aging populations increases in life expectancy increases in the availability of generic drugs the continued development of innovative drugs that improve quality of life and control healthcare costs and increases in the number of persons with insurance coverage for prescription drugs including in the united states “baby boomers” increasingly becoming eligible for the federally funded medicare part d prescription program pharmaceutical

wholesalers act as a vital link between drug manufacturers and pharmacies and healthcare providers in supplying pharmaceuticals to patients 

the retail pharmacy industry across the globe relies significantly on private and governmental thirdparty payers many private organizations throughout the healthcare industry including pharmacy benefit management “pbm” companies and health insurance companies have consolidated in recent years to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater bargaining power thirdparty payers including the medicare part d plans and the statesponsored medicaid and related managed care medicaid agencies in the united states can change eligibility requirements or reduce certain reimbursement rates in addition in many european countries the government provides or subsidizes healthcare to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices patient eligibility and reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored healthcare system changes in law or regulation also can impact reimbursement rates and terms for example the patient protection and affordable care act the “aca” was enacted to help control federal healthcare spending including for prescription drugs in the united states these changes generally are expected to reduce medicaid reimbursements in the united states state medicaid programs are also expected to continue to seek reductions in reimbursements when thirdparty payers or governmental authorities take actions that restrict eligibility or reduce prices or reimbursement rates sales and margins in the retail pharmacy industry could be reduced which would adversely affect industry profitability in some cases these possible adverse effects may be partially or entirely offset by controlling inventory costs and other expenses dispensing more higher margin generics finding new revenue streams through pharmacy services or other offerings andor dispensing a greater volume of prescriptions 

these industry dynamics and challenges are continuous and have intensified in recent years since the completion of the strategic combination with alliance boots in december 2014 the company has had a continuous focus on operational efficiencies and cost reduction during fiscal 2019 the company intends to maintain this focus including the evaluation of a number of potential strategic cost management initiatives 

generic prescription drugs have continued to help lower overall costs for customers and thirdparty payers the company expects the utilization of generic pharmaceuticals to continue to increase in general in the united states generic versions of drugs generate lower sales dollars per prescription but higher gross profit dollars as compared with patentprotected brand name drugs the impact on retail pharmacy gross profit dollars can be significant in the first several months after a generic version of a drug is first allowed to compete with the branded version which is generally referred to as a “generic conversion” in any given year the number of major brand name drugs that undergo a conversion from branded to generic status can vary and the timing of generic conversions can be difficult to predict which can have a significant impact on retail pharmacy sales and gross profit dollars 

the company expects that market demand government regulation thirdparty reimbursement policies government contracting requirements and other pressures will continue to cause the industries in which the company competes to evolve pharmacists are on the frontlines of the healthcare delivery system and the company believes rising healthcare costs and the limited supply of primary care physicians present opportunities for pharmacists and retail pharmacies to play an even greater role in driving positive outcomes for patients and payers through expanded service offerings such as immunizations and other preventive care healthcare clinics pharmacistled medication therapy management and chronic condition management

the components of the division’s sales are pharmacy the sale of prescription drugs and provision of pharmacyrelated services and retail the sale of healthcare and retail products including nonprescription drugs beauty toiletries and general merchandise the division’s sales are subject to the influence of seasonality particularly the winter holiday and cough cold and flu seasons this seasonality also can affect the division’s proportion of sales between retail and pharmacy during certain periods the components of the division’s fiscal year sales were as follows 



the company filled 8231 million  prescriptions including immunizations in the division in fiscal 2018  adjusted to 30day equivalents prescriptions filled were 11 billion  in fiscal 2018  sales where reimbursement is received from managed care organizations governmental agencies pbm companies and private insurance were approximately 98  of the division’s fiscal 2018  pharmacy sales

amerisourcebergen supplies and distributes a significant amount of generic and branded pharmaceutical products to the division’s pharmacies the company purchases its nonpharmaceutical merchandise from numerous manufacturers and wholesalers 

the division’s sales gross profit margin and gross profit are impacted by among other things both the percentage of prescriptions filled that are generic and the rate at which new generic drugs are introduced to the market because any number of factors outside of the company’s control can affect timing for a generic conversion the company faces substantial uncertainty in predicting when such conversions will occur and what effect they will have on particular future periods 

the current environment of the company’s pharmacy business also includes ongoing reimbursement pressure and a shift in pharmacy mix towards 90day at retail one prescription that is the equivalent of three 30day prescriptions and medicare part d prescriptions further consolidation among generic manufacturers coupled with changes in the number of major brand name drugs anticipated to undergo a conversion from branded to generic status may also result in gross margin pressures within the industry 

 4   

the company continuously faces reimbursement pressure from pbm companies health maintenance organizations managed care organizations and other commercial thirdparty payers agreements with these payers are regularly subject to expiration termination or renegotiation in addition plan changes with rate adjustments often occur in january and the company’s reimbursement arrangements may provide for rate adjustments at prescribed intervals during their term the company experienced lower reimbursement rates in fiscal 2018  as compared to the same period in the prior year the company expects these pressures to continue 

the company has also worked to develop and expand its relationships with commercial thirdparty payers to enable new andor improved market access via participation in pharmacy provider networks they offer the prescription volume impact of new agreements and relationships typically is incremental over time 

the company’s 90day at retail prescription drug offering is typically at a lower margin than comparable 30day prescriptions but provides the company with the opportunity to increase business with patients with chronic prescription needs while offering increased convenience helping facilitate improved prescription adherence and resulting in a lower cost to fill the 90day prescription

 5   

the division’s sales are subject to the influence of seasonality with the second fiscal quarter typically the strongest as a result of the winter holiday period this seasonality affects the division’s proportion of sales between retail and pharmacy during certain periods the components of the division’s fiscal year sales were as follows 



the division’s retail sales gross profit margin and gross profit dollars are impacted by among other things the highly competitive nature of the health and beauty category specifically the company and its competitors’ pricing actions promotional offers and events and the customer’s desire for value and convenience 

the division’s pharmacy sales gross margin and gross profit dollars are impacted by governmental agencies and other thirdparty payers seeking to minimize increases in the costs of healthcare including pharmaceutical drug reimbursement rates in the united kingdom which is the division’s largest market for pharmacy sales the amount of government funding available for pharmacy services is typically reviewed and agreed with the pharmacy industry on an annual basis 

in addition performance as measured in us dollars is impacted by the exchange rates used to translate these amounts into us dollars the exchange rate of british pound sterling being the most significant

the division’s sales gross profit margin and gross profit dollars are impacted by among other things government actions which typically seek to reduce the growth in prescription drug consumption reduce reimbursement rates and increase generic drug utilization a greater proportion of generic drugs whether as a result of government actions generic conversions or other factors typically has an adverse effect on the company’s revenues however in the wholesale division the company typically earns equal or better gross margins on generic drugs than on branded drugs although there are exceptions 

changes in manufacturers’ product distribution business models can also impact the division’s sales and gross margin for example when pharmaceutical drug manufacturers introduce feeforservice contracts the company’s sales are reduced even if it is successful in winning these contracts as the company only recognizes sales for the amount of the fees charged other manufacturer services including prewholesale and contract logistics operations are typically on a feeforservice basis 

in addition performance as measured in us dollars is impacted by the exchange rates used to translate these amounts into us dollars the exchange rate of british pound sterling and the euro being the most significant the division’s sales are subject to less seasonality than the company’s other divisions

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information in this report and our other filings with the sec you should carefully consider the risks described below which could materially and adversely affect our business operations financial condition and results of operations these risks are not the only risks that we face our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial 

reductions in thirdparty reimbursement levels from private or governmental agency plans and potential changes in industry pricing benchmarks for prescription drugs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

the substantial majority of the prescriptions we fill are reimbursed by thirdparty payers including private and governmental agency payers the continued efforts of health maintenance organizations managed care organizations pbm companies governmental agencies and other thirdparty payers to reduce prescription drug costs and pharmacy reimbursement rates as well as litigation and other legal proceedings relating to how drugs are priced may adversely impact our results of operations in the united states plan changes with rate adjustments often occur in january and our reimbursement arrangements may provide for rate adjustments at prescribed intervals during their term in addition in an environment where some pbm clients utilize narrow or restricted pharmacy provider networks some of these entities may offer pricing terms that we may not be willing to accept or otherwise restrict our participation in their networks of pharmacy providers 

changes in political economic and regulatory influences also may significantly affect healthcare financing and prescription drug reimbursement practices in the united states for example there have been multiple attempts through executive action legislative action and legal challenges to modify or repeal the aca we cannot predict whether current or future efforts to modify or repeal these laws will be successful nor can we predict the impact that such a modification or repeal and any 

 8   

subsequent legislation would have on our business and reimbursement levels there have also been a number of other proposals and enactments by the federal government and various states to reduce medicare part d and medicaid reimbursement levels in response to budget deficits and we expect additional proposals in the future in the event that a thirdparty payer’s budgetary or financial condition deteriorates they may not be able to pay timely or may delay payment of amounts owed to us there can be no assurance that recent or future changes in prescription drug reimbursement policies and practices will not materially and adversely affect our results of operations in many countries where we have operations the government provides or subsidizes healthcare to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices patient eligibility and reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored healthcare system efforts to control healthcare costs including prescription drug costs are continuous and reductions in thirdparty reimbursement levels could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

in addition many payers in the united states are increasingly considering new metrics as the basis for reimbursement rates it is possible that the pharmaceutical industry or regulators may evaluate andor develop an alternative pricing reference to replace average wholesale price which is the pricing reference used for many of our contracts in addition many state medicaid feeforservice programs have established pharmacy network payments on the basis of actual acquisition cost which could have an impact on reimbursement practices in other commercial and governmental arrangements future changes to the pricing benchmarks used to establish pharmaceutical pricing including changes in the basis for calculating reimbursement by thirdparty payers could adversely affect us 

a shift in pharmacy mix toward lower margin plans and programs could adversely affect our results of operations 

our retail pharmacy usa division seeks to grow prescription volume while operating in a marketplace with continuous reimbursement pressure a shift in the mix of pharmacy prescription volume towards programs offering lower reimbursement rates could adversely affect our results of operations for example our retail pharmacy usa division has experienced a shift in pharmacy mix towards 90day at retail in recent years our 90day at retail offering for patients with chronic prescription needs typically is at a lower margin than comparable 30day prescriptions our retail pharmacy usa division also has experienced a shift in pharmacy mix towards medicare part d prescriptions in recent years and that trend may continue preferred medicare part d networks have increased in number in recent years however we do not participate in all such networks we have accepted lower reimbursement rates in order to secure preferred relationships with medicare part d plans serving senior patients with significant pharmacy needs we also have worked to develop and expand our relationships with commercial thirdparty payers to enable new andor improved market access via participation in the pharmacy provider networks they offer if we are not able to generate additional prescription volume and other business from patients participating in these programs that is sufficient to offset the impact of lower reimbursement or if the degree or terms of our participation in such preferred networks declines from current levels in future years our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we derive a significant portion of our sales in the united states from prescription drug sales reimbursed by a limited number of pharmacy benefit management companies 

we derive a significant portion of our sales in the united states from prescription drug sales reimbursed through prescription drug plans administered by a limited number of pbm companies pbm companies typically administer multiple prescription drug plans that expire at various times and provide for varying reimbursement rates and often limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list known as a formulary which might not include all of the approved drugs for a particular indication there can be no assurance that we will continue to participate in any particular pbm company’s pharmacy provider network in any particular future time period if our participation in the pharmacy provider network for a prescription drug plan administered by one or more of the large pbm companies is restricted or terminated we expect that our sales would be adversely affected at least in the shortterm if we are unable to replace any such lost sales either through an increase in other sales or through a resumption of participation in those plans our operating results could be materially and adversely affected if we exit a pharmacy provider network and later resume participation there can be no assurance that we will achieve any particular level of business on any particular pace or that all clients of the pbm company will choose to include us again in the pharmacy network for their plans initially or at all in addition in such circumstances we may incur increased marketing and other costs in connection with initiatives to regain former patients and attract new patients covered by such plans 

we could be adversely affected by a decrease in the introduction of new brand name and generic prescription drugs as well as increases in the cost to procure prescription drugs 

the profitability of our pharmacy businesses depends upon the utilization of prescription drugs utilization trends are affected by among other factors the introduction of new and successful prescription drugs as well as lowerpriced generic alternatives to existing brand name drugs inflation in the price of drugs also can adversely affect utilization particularly given the increased prevalence of highdeductible health insurance plans and related plan design changes new brand name drugs can

result in increased drug utilization and associated sales while the introduction of lower priced generic alternatives typically results in relatively lower sales but relatively higher gross profit margins accordingly a decrease in the number or magnitude of significant new brand name drugs or generics successfully introduced delays in their introduction or a decrease in the utilization of previously introduced prescription drugs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

in addition if we experience an increase in the amounts we pay to procure pharmaceutical drugs including generic drugs it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations our gross profit margins would be adversely affected to the extent we are not able to offset such cost increases any failure to fully offset any such increased prices and costs or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations additionally any future changes in drug prices could be significantly different than our expectations 

consolidation and strategic alliances in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business operations competitive positioning financial condition and results of operations 

many organizations in the healthcare industry including pbm companies have consolidated in recent years to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater bargaining power which has resulted in greater pricing pressures if this consolidation trend continues it could give the resulting enterprises even greater bargaining power which may lead to further pressure on the prices for our products and services if these pressures result in reductions in our prices our businesses would become less profitable unless we are able to achieve corresponding reductions in costs or develop profitable new revenue streams 

new and proposed acquisitions partnerships and strategic alliances in the healthcare industry also can alter market dynamics and impact our businesses and competitive positioning for example in december 2017 cvs health corporation an integrated pharmacy health care company that operates one of the largest retail drugstore chains and pbm companies in the united states announced an agreement to acquire aetna inc one of the largest diversified health care benefits companies subject to certain closing conditions changes in the participants in global sourcing enterprises relating to drug procurement whether as a result of mergers acquisitions or other transactions can also have a similar effect on market dynamics and our business in addition further consolidation among generic drug manufacturers could lead to generic drug inflation in the future we expect that market demand government regulation thirdparty reimbursement policies government contracting requirements and other pressures will continue to cause the healthcare industry to evolve potentially resulting in further business consolidations and alliances and increased vertical integration among the industry participants we engage with and which could if we are not able to successfully anticipate and respond to evolving industry conditions in a timely and effective manner materially and adversely impact our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

our growth strategy is partially dependent upon our ability to identify and successfully complete acquisitions joint ventures and other strategic alliances 

a significant element of our growth strategy is to identify pursue and successfully complete acquisitions joint ventures and other strategic alliances that either expand or complement our existing operations we have grown significantly through acquisitions in recent years and expect to continue to acquire partner with or invest in businesses that build on or are deemed complementary to our existing businesses or further our strategic objectives due in part to consolidation in the industries in which we compete there is significant competition for attractive targets and opportunities when available there can be no assurance that attractive acquisition or other strategic relationship opportunities will be available that we will be successful in identifying negotiating and consummating favorable transaction opportunities or that any such transactions we complete will be successful and justify our investment of financial and other resources therein 

acquisitions and other strategic transactions involve numerous risks including difficulties in successfully integrating the operations and personnel distraction of management from overseeing and disruption of our existing operations difficulties in entering markets or lines of business in which we have no or limited direct prior experience the possible loss of key employees and customers and difficulties in achieving the synergies we anticipated any failure to select suitable opportunities at fair prices conduct appropriate due diligence and successfully integrate the acquired company including particularly when acquired businesses operate in new geographic markets or areas of business could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations these transactions may also cause us to significantly increase our interest expense leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition or investment issue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders’ percentage ownership or incur asset writeoffs and restructuring costs and other related expenses that could have a material adverse impact on our operating results acquisitions joint ventures and strategic investments also involve numerous other risks including potential exposure to assumed litigation and unknown environmental and other liabilities as well as undetected internal control regulatory or other issues or additional costs not anticipated at the time the transaction was completed no assurance can be given that our acquisitions joint ventures and other strategic alliances will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business operations financial condition or 

 10   

results of operations if we are unable to successfully identify complete and integrate acquisitions joint ventures and strategic investments in a timely and effective manner our business operations and growth strategies could be negatively affected 

our strategic relationships include outsourcing and similar relationships we outsource certain business and administrative functions and rely on third parties to perform certain services on our behalf for example in 2017 we entered into a 10year global agreement with fareva for the manufacture and supply of own beauty brands and private label products under the terms of the agreement fareva acquired bcm walgreens boots alliance’s contract manufacturing business in october 2017 we rely on these third parties to meet our quality and performance requirements and to timely perform as expected we periodically negotiate provisions and renewals of these relationships and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to us or such third parties if our continuing relationship with certain thirdparty providers is interrupted or if such thirdparty providers experience disruptions or do not perform as anticipated or we experience problems with any transition we may experience operational difficulties reputational harm and increased costs that could materially and adversely affect our business operations and results of operations 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of assets from rite aid pursuant to the amended and restated asset purchase agreement which could adversely impact our results of operations 

we entered into the amended and restated asset purchase agreement to acquire certain rite aid stores and distribution centers with the expectation that the transaction will result in various benefits including among other things cost savings and operating efficiencies the achievement of the anticipated benefits of the transaction is subject to a number of uncertainties including completion of the pending acquisition of distribution centers and related inventory expected to begin during fiscal 2019 whether the acquired assets can be integrated into our business in an efficient and effective manner the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding potential synergies and the integration process unforeseen expenses or delays and competitive factors in the marketplace we can provide no assurance that the anticipated benefits of the transaction including cost savings and synergies will be fully realized in the time frame anticipated or at all the costs or difficulties related to the integration of the acquired assets into our business and operations will not be greater than expected unanticipated costs charges and expenses will not result from the transaction litigation relating to the transaction will not be filed and the transaction will not cause disruption to the parties’ business and operations and relationships with employees and suppliers payers customers and other third parties if one or more of these risks are realized it could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 

we could also encounter unforeseen transaction and integrationrelated costs or other circumstances such as unforeseen liabilities or other issues resulting from the transaction many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs decreased revenue decreased synergies and the diversion of management time and attention which could adversely impact our agility to respond to market opportunities and our ability to timely identify and implement other strategic actions if we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame or at all the expected benefits may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations financial condition and results of operations in addition we have incurred significant transaction costs related to the transaction and expect to continue to incur significant integration and related costs as we integrate the acquired rite aid assets these integration and acquisitionrelated costs including legal accounting financial and tax advisory and other fees and costs may be higher than expected and some of these costs may be material 

our business results depend on our ability to successfully manage ongoing organizational change and business transformation and achieve cost savings and operating efficiency initiatives 

our board of directors approved the plan to implement the store optimization program described in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii item 7 below as part of an initiative to reduce costs and increase operating efficiencies there can be no assurance that we will realize in full or in part the anticipated benefits of this program our financial goals assume a level of productivity improvement including those reflected in the store optimization program and other business optimization initiatives if we are unable to deliver these expected productivity improvements while continuing to invest in business growth or if the volume and nature of change overwhelms available resources our business operations and financial results could be materially and adversely impacted our ability to successfully manage and execute these initiatives and realize expected savings and benefits in the amounts and at the times anticipated is important to our business success any failure to do so which could result from our inability to successfully execute organizational change and business transformation plans changes in global or regional economic conditions competition changes in the industries in which we compete unanticipated costs or charges loss of key personnel and other factors described herein could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition and results of operations

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and constantly evolving new entrants to the market existing competitor actions or other changes in market dynamics could adversely impact us 

the level of competition in the retail pharmacy and pharmaceutical wholesale industries is high changes in market dynamics or actions of competitors or manufacturers including industry consolidation and the emergence of new competitors and strategic alliances could materially and adversely impact us disruptive innovation or the perception of potentially disruptive innovation by existing or new competitors could alter the competitive landscape in the future and require us to accurately identify and assess such changes and if required make timely and effective changes to our strategies and business model to compete effectively for example in june 2018 online retailer amazoncom inc announced its pending acquisition of pillpack an online pharmacy with licenses throughout the united states subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions some industry analysts have speculated that the acquisition if completed could provide a platform for amazon to significantly expand into the market for prescription drugs our retail pharmacy businesses face intense competition from local regional national and global companies including other drugstore and pharmacy chains independent drugstores and pharmacies mailorder pharmacies and various other retailers such as grocery stores convenience stores mass merchants online and omnichannel pharmacies and retailers warehouse clubs dollar stores and other discount merchandisers some of which are aggressively expanding in markets we serve businesses in our pharmaceutical wholesale division face intense competition from direct competitors including national and regional cooperative wholesalers and alternative supply sources such as importers and manufacturers who supply directly to pharmacies competition may also come from other sources in the future as competition increases in the markets in which we operate a significant increase in general pricing pressures could occur which could require us to reevaluate our pricing structures to remain competitive for example if we are not able to anticipate and successfully respond to changes in market conditions in our pharmaceutical wholesale division including changes driven by competitors suppliers or manufacturers and increased competition from national and regional cooperative wholesalers it could result in a loss of customers or renewal of contracts or arrangements on less favorable terms 

we also could be adversely affected if we fail to identify or effectively respond to changes in market dynamics as technology consumer behavior and market conditions continue to evolve in the united states it is important that we maintain the relevance of our brand and product and service offerings to customers and patients in april 2018 we announced that we are testing a number of concepts and initiatives designed to position our stores in the united states as convenient community hubs for healthcare and retail products and services the concepts being tested include new approaches to pricing and promotions product selection instore and digital experience and strategic partnerships that bring new products and services to our customers we plan to use these pilots to listen to customers learn and adjust based on feedback with decisions on the nature and extent of further rollouts made over time as we gain experience if our customers are not receptive to these changes if we are unable to expand successful programs in a timely manner or we otherwise do not effectively respond to changes in market dynamics our businesses and financial performance could be materially and adversely affected as a further example specialty pharmacy represents a significant and growing proportion of prescription drug spending in the united states a significant portion of which is dispensed outside of traditional retail pharmacies because our specialty pharmacy business focuses on complex and highcost medications many of which are made available by manufacturers to a limited number of pharmacies socalled limited distribution drugs that serve a relatively limited universe of patients the future growth of this business depends to a significant extent upon expanding our ability to access key drugs and successfully penetrate key treatment categories accordingly it is important that we and our affiliates compete effectively in this evolving market or our business operations financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected to better serve this evolving market in march 2017 we and prime therapeutics llc a pbm closed a transaction to form a combined central specialty pharmacy and mail services company alliancerx walgreens prime using an innovative model that seeks to align pharmacy pbm and health plans to coordinate patient care improve health outcomes and deliver cost of care opportunities if this joint venture is not able to compete effectively in this evolving market and successfully adapt to changing market conditions our business operations financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

our substantial international business operations subject us to a number of operating economic political regulatory and other international business risks 

our substantial international business operations are important to our growth and prospects including particularly those of our retail pharmacy international and pharmaceutical wholesale divisions and are subject to a number of risks including 

 

 12   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these factors can also adversely affect our payers vendors and customers in international markets which in turn can negatively impact our businesses we cannot assure you that one or more of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations results of operation and financial condition 

many of these factors are subject to change based on changes in political economic and regulatory influences for example 

 



 13   

activity in addition other countries may change their business and trade policies in anticipation of or in response to increased import tariffs and other changes in united states trade policy and regulations 

  

there can be no assurance that any or all of these developments will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations results of operations and financial condition 

we are exposed to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

our significant operations outside of the united states expose us to currency exchange rate fluctuations and related risks including transaction currency exposures relating to the import and export of goods in currencies other than businesses’ functional currencies as well as currency translation exposures relating to profits and net assets denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we present our financial statements in us dollars and have a significant proportion of net assets and income in nonus dollar currencies primarily the british pound sterling and the euro as well as a range of other foreign currencies our results of operations and capital ratios can therefore be sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future results of operations in addition fluctuations in currencies relative to the us dollar may make it more difficult to perform periodtoperiod comparisons of our reported results of operations a depreciation of nonus dollar currencies relative to the us dollar could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations 

we may from time to time in some instances enter into foreign currency contracts or other derivative instruments intended to hedge a portion of our foreign currency fluctuation risks which subjects us to additional risks such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations to us that could materially and adversely affect us additionally we may and currently do use foreign currency debt to hedge some of our foreign currency fluctuation risks the periodic use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place we cannot assure you that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates including particularly the strengthening of the us dollar against major currencies or the currencies of large developing countries will not materially affect our consolidated financial results 

disruption in our global supply chain could negatively impact our businesses 

the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors and any future disruption in our supply chain or inability to find qualified vendors and access products that meet requisite quality and safety standards in a timely and efficient manner could adversely impact our businesses the loss or disruption of such supply arrangements for any reason including for issues such as labor disputes loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites inability to procure sufficient raw materials quality control issues ethical sourcing issues a supplier’s financial distress natural disasters civil unrest or acts of war or terrorism trade sanctions or other external factors over which we have no control could interrupt product supply and if not effectively managed and remedied have a material adverse impact on our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

we use a single wholesaler of branded and generic pharmaceutical drugs as our primary source of such products for our retail pharmacy usa division 

in march 2013 walgreens alliance boots and amerisourcebergen announced various agreements and arrangements including a tenyear pharmaceutical distribution agreement between walgreens and amerisourcebergen pursuant to which we source branded and generic pharmaceutical products from amerisourcebergen in the us and an agreement which provides amerisourcebergen the ability to access generics pharmaceutical products through our global sourcing enterprise in may 2016 certain of these agreements were extended for three years to now expire in 2026 in addition in march 2013 walgreens alliance boots and amerisourcebergen entered into agreements and arrangements pursuant to which we have the right but not the obligation to purchase a minority equity position in amerisourcebergen and gain associated representation on amerisourcebergen’s board of directors in certain circumstances as of the date of this report amerisourcebergen distributes for our retail pharmacy usa division substantially all branded and generic pharmaceutical products consequently our business in the united states may be adversely affected by any operational financial or regulatory difficulties that amerisourcebergen experiences for example if amerisourcebergen’s operations are seriously disrupted for any reason whether due to a natural disaster labor disruption regulatory action computer or operational systems or otherwise it could adversely affect our business in the united states and our results of operations 

our distribution agreement with amerisourcebergen is subject to early termination in certain circumstances and upon the expiration or termination of the agreement there can be no assurance that we or amerisourcebergen will be willing to renew 

 14   

the agreement or enter into a new agreement on terms favorable to us or at all if such expiration or termination occurred we believe that alternative sources of supply for most generic and brandname pharmaceuticals are readily available and that we could obtain and qualify alternative sources which may include selfdistribution in some cases for substantially all of the prescription drugs we sell on an acceptable basis such that the impact of any such expiration or termination would be temporary however there can be no assurance we would be able to engage alternative supply sources or implement selfdistribution processes on a timely basis or on terms favorable to us or effectively manage these transitions any of which could adversely affect our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

the anticipated strategic and financial benefits of our relationship with amerisourcebergen may not be realized 

we entered into the arrangement with amerisourcebergen with the expectation that the transactions contemplated thereby would result in various benefits including among other things procurement cost savings and operating efficiencies innovation and sharing of best practices the processes and initiatives needed to achieve these potential benefits are complex costly and timeconsuming achieving the anticipated benefits from the arrangement is subject to a number of significant challenges and uncertainties including the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations processes or initiatives or the inability to realize andor delays in realizing potential benefits and synergies whether unique corporate cultures of separate organizations will work collaboratively in an efficient and effective manner unforeseen expenses or delays and competitive factors in the marketplace 

as of august 31 2018 we beneficially owned approximately 26 of the outstanding amerisourcebergen common stock and had designated one member of amerisourcebergen’s board of directors in addition we have the right but not the obligation under the transactions contemplated by the framework agreement dated as of march 18 2013 by and among the company alliance boots and amerisourcebergen the “framework agreement” to acquire up to an additional 8398752  amerisourcebergen shares in the open market and thereafter designate another member of amerisourcebergen’s board of directors subject in each case to applicable legal and contractual requirements there can be no assurance that we will complete any specific level of such potential equity investments in amerisourcebergen or that our existing investment or any future investment if completed will ultimately be profitable if the price of amerisourcebergen common stock subsequently declines substantially we could experience a loss on or impairment of such investment which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations further our ability to transact in amerisourcebergen securities is subject to certain restrictions set forth in our agreements with amerisourcebergen and arising under applicable laws and regulations which in some circumstances could adversely our ability to transact in amerisourcebergen securities in amounts and at the times desired we could also encounter unforeseen costs circumstances or issues existing or arising with respect to the transactions and collaboration resulting from these agreements many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs decreased revenue decreased synergies and the diversion of management time and attention if we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame or at all the expected benefits may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we make investments in companies over which we do not have sole control some of these companies may operate in sectors that differ from our current operations and have different risks 

from time to time we make debt or equity investments in companies that we may not control or over which we may not have sole control for example while we have a significant equity investment in amerisourcebergen and have a designee serving on the board of directors of amerisourcebergen as of the date of this report we do not have the ability to control daytoday operations of that company although the businesses in which we have made noncontrolling investments often have a significant health and daily living or prescription drug component some of them operate in businesses that are different from our primary lines of business andor operate in different geographic markets than we do for example in july 2018 we acquired a 40 minority stake in sinopharm holding guoda drugstores co ltd a leading retail pharmacy chain in china investments in these businesses among other risks subject us to the operating and financial risks of the businesses we invest in and to the risk that we do not have sole control over the operations of these businesses we rely on the internal controls and financial reporting controls of these entities and their failure to maintain effectiveness or comply with applicable standards may materially and adversely affect us investments in entities over which we do not have sole control including joint ventures and strategic alliances present additional risks such as having differing objectives from our partners or the entities in which we are invested becoming involved in disputes or competing with those persons from time to time we may make additional investments in or acquire other entities that may subject us to similar risks 

changes in economic conditions could adversely affect consumer buying practices 

 15   

our performance has been and may continue to be adversely impacted by changes in global national regional or local economic conditions and consumer confidence these conditions can also adversely affect our key vendors and customers external factors that affect consumer confidence and over which we exercise no influence include unemployment rates inflation levels of personal disposable income levels of taxes and interest and global national regional or local economic conditions as well as acts of war or terrorism changes in economic conditions and consumer confidence could adversely affect consumer preferences purchasing power and spending patterns which could lead to a decrease in overall consumer spending as well as in prescription drug and health services utilization and which could be exacerbated by the increasing prevalence of highdeductible health insurance plans and related plan design changes in addition reduced or flat consumer spending may drive us and our competitors to offer additional products at promotional prices all of these factors could materially and adversely impact our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

economic conditions in europe and certain emerging market countries together with austerity measures being taken by certain governments could adversely affect us 

we have significant assets and operations within europe and certain emerging market countries in our retail pharmacy international and pharmaceutical wholesale divisions an economic slowdown within any such markets could adversely affect our businesses in affected regions by reducing the prices our customers may be able or willing to pay for our products and services or by reducing the demand for our products and services either of which could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations in recent years in response to the economic environment a number of governments including the government in the united kingdom have announced or implemented austerity measures to reduce healthcare spending for the governmentsponsored healthcare systems and constrain overall government expenditures these measures which include efforts aimed at reforming healthcare coverage and reducing healthcare costs continue to exert pressure on the pricing of and reimbursement timelines for pharmaceutical drugs countries with existing austerity measures may impose additional laws regulations or requirements on the healthcare industry in addition governments that have not yet imposed austerity measures may impose them in the future any new austerity measures may be similar to or vary in scope and nature from existing austerity measures and could have a material adverse effect on our international business operations and results of operations 

if we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant omnichannel experience for our customers our businesses and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

the portion of total consumer expenditures with retailers occurring online and through mobile applications has continued to increase and the pace of this increase could accelerate in the future our business has evolved from an instore experience to interaction with customers across numerous channels including instore online mobile and social media among others omnichannel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing customer expectations and new developments by our competitors our customers are increasingly using computers tablets mobile phones and other devices to comparison shop determine product availability and complete purchases as well as to provide immediate public reactions regarding various facets of our operations we must compete by offering a consistent and convenient shopping experience for our customers regardless of the ultimate sales channel and by investing in providing and maintaining digital tools for our customers that have the right features and are reliable and easy to use if we are unable to make improve or develop relevant customerfacing technology in a timely manner that keeps pace with technological developments and dynamic customer expectations our ability to compete and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected in addition if our online activities or our other customerfacing technology systems do not function as designed we may experience a loss of customer confidence data security breaches lost sales or be exposed to fraudulent purchases any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations reputation and results of operations 

if the merchandise and services that we offer fail to meet customer needs our sales may be adversely affected 

we could be adversely affected by changes in consumer spending levels and shopping habits and preferences including attitudes towards our retail and product brands the success of our retail pharmacy businesses depends on our ability to offer a superior shopping experience engaging customer service and a quality assortment of available merchandise that differentiates us from other retailers including enhanced health and beauty product offerings we must identify obtain supplies of and offer to our customers attractive innovative and highquality merchandise on a continuous basis our products and services must satisfy the needs and desires of our customers whose preferences may change in the future for example our proof of concept initiatives that seek to position our stores in the united states as convenient community hubs for healthcare and retail products and services reflect the perceived desires and needs of our target market however it is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand if we misjudge either the demand for products and services we sell or our customers’ purchasing habits and tastes we may be faced with excess inventories of some products and missed opportunities for products and services we chose not to offer in addition our sales may decline or we may be required to sell the merchandise we have obtained at lower prices failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer 

 16   

tastes preferences and spending patterns and evolving demographic mixes in the markets we serve could negatively affect our relationship with our customers and the demand for our products and services which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations 

our private brand offerings expose us to various additional risks 

in addition to brand name products we offer our customers private brand products that are not available from other retailers we seek to continue to grow our exclusive private brand offerings as part of our growth strategy including through the expanded offering of no7 and other brands owned or licensed on an exclusive basis as well as through selective acquisitions maintaining consistent product quality competitive pricing and availability of our private brand offerings for our customers as well as the timely development and introduction of new products is important in differentiating us from other retailers and developing and maintaining customer loyalty although we believe that our private brand products offer value to our customers and typically provide us with higher gross margins than comparable national brand products we sell the expansion of our private brand offerings also subjects us to additional risks such as potential product liability risks and mandatory or voluntary product recalls our ability to successfully protect our proprietary rights and successfully navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties our ability to successfully administer and comply with applicable contractual obligations and regulatory requirements and other risks generally encountered by entities that source sell and market exclusive branded offerings for retail an increase in sales of our private brands may also adversely affect sales of our vendors’ products which in turn could adversely affect our relationship with certain of our vendors any failure to adequately address some or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business operations results of operations and financial condition 

we face significant competition in attracting and retaining talented employees further managing succession for and retention of key executives is critical to our success and our failure to do so could have an adverse impact on our future performance 

  

our ability to attract and retain qualified and experienced employees is essential to meet current and future goals and objectives and there is no guarantee we will be able to attract and retain such employees or that competition among potential employers will not result in increased salaries or other benefits an inability to retain existing employees or attract additional employees or an unexpected loss of leadership could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

  

in addition our failure to adequately plan for succession of senior management and other key management roles or the failure of key employees to successfully transition into new roles could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations while we have succession plans in place and employment arrangements with certain key executives these do not guarantee the services of these executives will continue to be available to us 

we may experience a significant disruption in our computer systems 

we rely extensively on our computer systems to manage our ordering pricing pointofsale pharmacy fulfillment inventory replenishment customer loyalty programs finance and other processes our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages facility damage computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches including credit card or personally identifiable information breaches vandalism natural disasters catastrophic events human error and potential cyber threats including malicious codes worms phishing attacks denial of service attacks ransomware and other sophisticated cyber attacks and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities if any of our systems are damaged fail to function properly or otherwise become unavailable we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience loss or corruption of critical data and interruptions or disruptions and delays in our ability to perform critical functions which could materially and adversely affect our businesses and results of operations in addition we are currently making and expect to continue to make substantial investments in our information technology systems and infrastructure some of which are significant upgrades involve replacing existing systems with successor systems making changes to existing systems or costeffectively acquiring new systems with new functionality implementing new systems carries significant potential risks including failure to operate as designed potential loss or corruption of data or information cost overruns implementation delays disruption of operations and the potential inability to meet business and reporting requirements while we are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems and believe we are taking reasonable action to mitigate known risks there can be no assurance that we will not experience significant issues with our existing systems prior to implementation that our technology initiatives will be successfully deployed as planned or that they will be timely implemented without significant disruption to our operations we also could be adversely affected by any significant disruption in the systems of third parties we interact with including key payers and vendors 

 17   

if we or the businesses we interact with do not maintain the privacy and security of sensitive customer and business information it could damage our reputation and we could suffer a loss of revenue incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation and regulatory scrutiny 

the protection of customer employee and company data is critical to our businesses cybersecurity and other information technology security risks such as a significant breach of customer employee or company data could attract a substantial amount of media attention damage our customer relationships and reputation and result in lost sales fines or lawsuits throughout our operations we receive retain and transmit certain personal information that our customers and others provide to purchase products or services fill prescriptions enroll in promotional programs participate in our customer loyalty programs register on our websites or otherwise communicate and interact with us in addition aspects of our operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks like other global companies we and businesses we interact with have experienced threats to data and systems including by perpetrators of random or targeted malicious cyberattacks computer viruses worms bot attacks or other destructive or disruptive software and attempts to misappropriate customer information including credit card information and cause system failures and disruptions although we deploy a layered approach to address information security threats and vulnerabilities designed to protect confidential information against data security breaches a compromise of our data security systems or of those of businesses with whom we interact which results in confidential information being accessed obtained damaged or used by unauthorized or improper persons could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions customer attrition remediation expenses and claims from customers financial institutions payment card associations and other persons any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations financial condition and results of operations because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures in addition a security breach could require that we expend substantial additional resources related to the security of information systems and disrupt our businesses 

we depend on and interact with the information technology networks and systems of thirdparties for many aspects of our business operations including payers strategic partners and cloud service providers these third parties may have access to information we maintain about our company operations customers employees and vendors or operating systems that are critical to or can significantly impact our business operations like us these thirdparties are subject to risks imposed by data breaches and cyberattacks and other events or actions that could damage disrupt or close down their networks or systems security processes protocols and standards that we have implemented and contractual provisions requiring security measures that we may have sought to impose on such thirdparties may not be sufficient or effective at preventing such events which could result in unauthorized access to or disruptions or denials of access to or misuse of information or systems that are important to our business including proprietary information sensitive or confidential data and other information about our operations customers employees and suppliers including personal information 

the regulatory environment surrounding data security and privacy is increasingly demanding with the frequent imposition of new and changing requirements across businesses and geographic areas we are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing data security and privacy regulations in the united states and in other jurisdictions in which we operate that regulate the collection use and transfer of personal data including the transfer of personal data between or among countries in the united states for example hipaa imposes extensive privacy and security requirements governing the transmission use and disclosure of health information by all participants in the health care industry some foreign data privacy regulations are more stringent than those in the united states and continue to change for example the european union’s general data protection regulation which greatly increased the jurisdictional reach of european union data protection laws and added a broad array of requirements for handling personal data including the public disclosure of significant data breaches and provides for greater penalties for noncompliance became effective in may 2018 other countries have enacted or are considering enacting data localization laws that require certain data to stay within their borders complying with changing regulatory requirements requires us to incur substantial costs and may require changes to our business practices in certain jurisdictions any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations and operating results we may also face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations compliance with changes in privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes if we or those with whom we share information fail to comply with these laws and regulations or experience a data security breach our reputation could be damaged and we could be subject to additional litigation and regulatory risks our security measures may be undermined due to the actions of outside parties employee error malfeasance or otherwise and as a result an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate business and personal information any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure damage to our reputation and potentially have a material adverse effect on our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

 18   

we are subject to paymentrelated risks that could increase our operating costs expose us to fraud or theft subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business operations 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including cash checks credit and debit cards gift cards and mobile payment technologies such as apple pay™ and we may offer new payment options over time acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules regulations contractual obligations and compliance requirements including payment network rules and operating guidelines data security standards and certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers these requirements and related interpretations may change over time which could make compliance more difficult or costly for certain payment methods including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which could increase over time and raise our operating costs we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards and other forms of electronic payment if these companies become unable to provide these services to us or if their systems are compromised it could disrupt our business the payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by persons who seek to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit any weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems if we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements or if data is compromised due to a breach or misuse of data relating to our payment systems we may be liable for costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments could be impaired in addition our reputation could suffer and our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types which could result in higher costs andor reduced sales and materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in healthcare regulatory environments may adversely affect our businesses 

political economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to significant changes that could adversely affect our results of operations in recent years the healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to reduce costs and government spending these changes include an increased reliance on managed care cuts in certain medicare and medicaid funding in the united states and the funding of governmental payers in foreign jurisdictions consolidation of competitors suppliers and other market participants and the development of large sophisticated purchasing groups we expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future some of these potential changes such as a reduction in governmental funding for certain healthcare services or adverse changes in legislation or regulations governing prescription drug pricing healthcare services or mandated benefits may cause customers to reduce the amount of our products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services we expect continued governmental and private payer pressure to reduce pharmaceutical pricing changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers’ pricing or distribution policies could also significantly reduce our profitability 

in the united states electoral results and changes in political leadership have generated uncertainty with respect to and could result in significant changes in legislation regulation and government policy that could significantly impact our businesses and the health care and retail industries there have been multiple attempts to repeal modify or otherwise invalidate all or certain provisions of the aca which was enacted in 2010 to provide health insurance coverage to millions of previously uninsured americans through a combination of insurance market reforms an expansion of medicaid subsidies and health insurance mandates we cannot predict whether current or future efforts to modify these laws andor adopt new healthcare legislation will be successful nor can we predict the impact that such a development would have on our business and operating results future legislation or rulemaking or other regulatory actions or developments under the aca or otherwise could adversely impact the number of americans with health insurance and consequently prescription drug coverage increase regulation of pharmacy services result in changes to pharmacy reimbursement rates and otherwise change the way we do business we cannot predict the timing or impact of any future legislative rulemaking or other regulatory actions but any such actions could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

a significant change in or noncompliance with governmental regulations and other legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and profitability 

we operate in complex highly regulated environments around the world and could be materially and adversely affected by changes to applicable legal requirements including the related interpretations and enforcement practices new legal requirements andor any failure to comply with applicable regulations businesses in our pharmaceutical wholesale division are subject to a range of regulations relating to such things as product margins product traceability and the conditions under which products must be stored our retail pharmacy and health and wellness services businesses are subject to numerous country state and local regulations including licensing and other requirements for pharmacies and reimbursement arrangements the regulations to which we are subject include but are not limited to country and state registration and regulation of pharmacies and drug discount card programs dispensing and sale of controlled substances and products containing pseudoephedrine applicable governmental payer regulations including medicare and medicaid data privacy and security laws and regulations including hipaa the aca or any successor thereto laws and regulations relating to the 

 19   

protection of the environment and health and safety matters including those governing exposure to and the management and disposal of hazardous substances regulations regarding food and drug safety including those of the us food and drug administration “fda” and drug enforcement administration “dea” trade regulations including those of the us federal trade commission and consumer protection and safety regulations including those of the consumer product safety commission as well as state regulatory authorities governing the availability sale advertisement and promotion of products we sell as well as our loyalty and drug discount card programs antikickback laws false claims laws laws against the corporate practice of medicine and foreign national and state laws governing health care fraud and abuse and the practice of the profession of pharmacy for example in the united states the dea fda and various other regulatory authorities regulate the distribution and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances we are required to hold valid dea and statelevel licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with the federal and various state controlled substance acts and related regulations governing the sale dispensing disposal holding and distribution of controlled substances the dea fda and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations we are also governed by foreign national and state laws of general applicability including laws regulating matters of working conditions health and safety and equal employment opportunity and other labor and employment matters as well as employee benefit competition and antitrust matters in addition we could have significant exposure if we are found to have infringed another party’s intellectual property rights 

changes in laws regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may alter the landscape in which we do business and may significantly affect our cost of doing business the impact of new laws regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices generally cannot be predicted and changes in applicable laws regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may require extensive system and operational changes be difficult to implement increase our operating costs and require significant capital expenditures untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties that could adversely affect the continued operation of our businesses including suspension of payments from government programs loss of required government certifications loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government programs including the medicare and medicaid programs in the united states and the national health service in the united kingdom loss of licenses and significant fines or monetary penalties any failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements in the united states or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in significant legal and financial exposure damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

we could be adversely affected by product liability product recall personal injury or other health and safety issues 

we could be adversely impacted by the supply of defective or expired products including the infiltration of counterfeit products into the supply chain errors in relabeling of products product tampering product recall and contamination or product mishandling issues through our pharmacies and specialist packaging sites we are also exposed to risks relating to the services we provide errors in the dispensing and packaging of pharmaceuticals including related counseling and in the provision of other healthcare services could lead to serious injury or death product liability or personal injury claims may be asserted against us with respect to any of the products or pharmaceuticals we sell or services we provide our healthcare clinics also increase our exposure to professional liability claims related to medical care should a product or other liability issue arise the coverage limits under our insurance programs and the indemnification amounts available to us may not be adequate to protect us against claims and judgments we also may not be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms in the future we could suffer significant reputational damage and financial liability if we or any affiliated entities experience any of the foregoing health and safety issues or incidents which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

we have significant outstanding debt our debt and associated payment obligations could significantly increase in the future if we incur additional debt and do not retire existing debt 

we have outstanding debt and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity as of august 31 2018 we had approximately 14 billion  of outstanding indebtedness including shortterm debt our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including 

 

 20   

 

 

 

 

we may incur or assume significantly more debt in the future including in connection with acquisitions strategic investments or joint ventures if we add new debt and do not retire existing debt the risks described above could increase we also could be adversely impacted by any failure to renew or replace on terms acceptable to us or at all existing funding arrangements when they expire and any failure to satisfy applicable covenants 

our longterm debt obligations include covenants that may adversely affect our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur certain secured indebtedness or engage in certain types of transactions in addition our existing credit agreements require us to maintain as of the last day of each fiscal quarter a ratio of consolidated debt to total capitalization not to exceed a certain level our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants may be affected by events beyond our control if we breach any of these restrictions or covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable this could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition 

we could be adversely affected by downgrades to our credit ratings or disruptions in our ability to access wellfunctioning capital markets 

historically we have relied on the public debt capital markets to fund portions of our capital investments and access to the commercial paper market and bank credit facilities as part of our working capital management strategy our continued access to these markets and the terms of such access depend on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets our operating performance and our credit ratings the major credit rating agencies have assigned us and our corporate debt investment grade credit ratings these ratings are based on a number of factors which include their assessment of our financial strength and financial policies we benefit from investment grade ratings as they serve to lower our borrowing costs and facilitate our access to a variety of lenders and other creditors including landlords for our leased stores on terms that we consider advantageous to our businesses however there can be no assurance that any particular rating assigned to us will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency if in that rating agency’s judgment future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating so warrant incurrence of additional debt by us could adversely affect our credit ratings we depend on banks and other financial institutions to provide credit to our business and perform under our agreements with them defaults by one or more of these counterparties on their obligations to us could materially and adversely affect us any disruptions or turmoil in the capital markets or any downgrade of our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets and increase the cost of and counterparty risks associated with existing facilities which could materially and adversely affect our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

we may be unable to keep existing store locations or open new locations in desirable places on favorable terms which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores local land use and zoning regulations environmental regulations and other regulatory requirements may impact our ability to find suitable locations and influence the cost of constructing renovating and operating our stores in addition real estate zoning construction and other delays may adversely affect store openings and renovations and increase our costs further changing local demographics at existing store locations may adversely affect revenue and profitability levels at those stores the termination or expiration of leases at existing store locations may adversely affect us if the renewal terms of those leases are unacceptable to us and we are forced to close or relocate stores if we determine to close or relocate a store subject to a lease we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for the balance of the lease term if we are unable to maintain our existing store locations or open new locations in desirable places and on favorable terms our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

as a holding company walgreens boots alliance is dependent on funding from its operating subsidiaries to pay dividends and other obligations 

 21   

walgreens boots alliance is a holding company with no business operations of its own its assets primarily consist of direct and indirect ownership interests in and its business is conducted through subsidiaries which are separate legal entities as a result it is dependent on funding from its subsidiaries including walgreens and alliance boots to meet its obligations additionally walgreens boots alliance’s subsidiaries may be restricted in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions to walgreens boots alliance which may limit the payment of cash dividends or other distributions to the holders of walgreens boots alliance common stock credit facilities and other debt obligations of walgreens boots alliance as well as statutory provisions may further limit the ability of walgreens boots alliance and its subsidiaries to pay dividends payments to walgreens boots alliance by its subsidiaries are also contingent upon its subsidiaries’ earnings and business considerations future walgreens boots alliance dividends will be determined based on earnings capital requirements financial condition and other factors considered relevant by its board of directors 

our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly 

our operating results have historically varied on a quarterly basis and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future factors that may affect our quarterly operating results some of which are beyond the control of management include but are not limited to the timing of the introduction of new generic and brand name prescription drugs inflation including with respect to generic drug procurement costs the timing and severity of the cough cold and flu season changes in payer reimbursement rates and terms fluctuations in inventory energy transportation labor healthcare and other costs significant acquisitions dispositions joint ventures and other strategic initiatives asset impairment charges the relative magnitude of our lifo provision in any particular quarter foreign currency fluctuations seasonality prolonged severe weather in key markets and many of the other risk factors discussed herein accordingly we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and investors should not rely on the results of any particular quarter as an indication of our future performance 

our businesses are seasonal in nature and adverse events during the holiday and cough cold and flu seasons could adversely impact our operating results 

our businesses are seasonal in nature with the second fiscal quarter december january and february typically generating a higher proportion of retail sales and earnings than other fiscal quarters we purchase significant amounts of seasonal inventory in anticipation of the holiday season adverse events such as deteriorating economic conditions higher unemployment higher gas prices public transportation disruptions or unanticipated adverse weather could result in lowerthanplanned sales during key selling seasons for example frequent or unusually heavy snowfall ice storms rainstorms windstorms or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period could make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and increase our snow removal and other costs this could lead to lower sales or to unanticipated markdowns negatively impacting our financial condition and results of operations in addition both prescription and nonprescription drug sales are affected by the timing and severity of the cough cold and flu season which can vary considerably from year to year 

we could be adversely impacted by changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters 

generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our businesses including but not limited to revenue recognition asset impairment impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets inventories equity method investments vendor rebates and other vendor consideration lease obligations selfinsurance liabilities pension and postretirement benefits tax matters unclaimed property laws and litigation and other contingent liabilities are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition for example changes in accounting standards and the application of existing accounting standards particularly related to the measurement of fair value as compared to carrying value for the company’s reporting units including goodwill intangible assets and investments in equity interests including investments held by our equity method investees may have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include significant adverse changes in the business climate and declines in the financial condition of a reporting unit factors that could lead to impairment of investments in equity interests of the companies in which we invested or the investments held by those companies include a prolonged period of decline in their operating performance or adverse changes in the economic regulatory and legal environments of the countries in which they operate in 

new accounting guidance also may require changes to our processes accounting systems and internal controls that could increase our operating costs andor significantly change our financial statements for example in february 2016 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu” 201602 leases topic 842 which 

 22   

supersedes topic 840 leases this asu which is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2018 fiscal 2020 seeks to increase the transparency and comparability of organizations by recognizing operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements see “new accounting pronouncements” within note 1  summary of major accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements implementing this asu as well as other new accounting guidance may require us to make significant upgrades to and investments in our lease administration systems and other accounting systems and could result in significant adverse changes to our financial statements 

we have a substantial amount of goodwill and other intangible assets which could in the future become impaired and result in material noncash charges to our results of operations 

as of august 31 2018 we had 287 billion  of goodwill and other intangible assets on the consolidated balance sheets we evaluate this goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value as part of this impairment analysis we determine fair value for each reporting unit using both the income and market approaches definitelived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable estimated fair values could change if for example there are changes in the business climate changes in the competitive environment adverse legal or regulatory actions or developments changes in capital structure cost of debt interest rates capital expenditure levels operating cash flows or market capitalization because of the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets any future impairment of these assets could require material noncash charges to our results of operations which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

we are exposed to risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings 

we operate in a highly regulated and litigious environment we are involved in legal proceedings including litigation arbitration and other claims and investigations inspections audits claims inquiries and similar actions by pharmacy healthcare tax and other governmental authorities including those contained in note 10  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this form 10k legal proceedings in general and securities class action and multidistrict litigation in particular can be expensive and disruptive some of these suits may purport or may be determined to be class actions andor involve parties seeking large andor indeterminate amounts including punitive or exemplary damages and may remain unresolved for several years in addition under the  qui tam  or “whistleblower” provisions of the federal and various state false claims acts persons may bring lawsuits alleging that a violation of the federal antikickback statute or similar laws has resulted in the submission of “false” claims to federal andor state healthcare programs including medicare and medicaid after a private party has filed a qui tam action the government must investigate the private partys claim and determine whether to intervene in and take control over the litigation these actions may remain under seal while the government makes this determination from time to time the company is also involved in legal proceedings as a plaintiff involving antitrust tax contract intellectual property and other matters we cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies and the costs incurred in litigation can be substantial regardless of the outcome substantial unanticipated verdicts fines and rulings do sometimes occur as a result we could from time to time incur judgments enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters and such developments could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued andor our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid the outcome of some of these legal proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could negatively affect our operations additionally defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management’s attention and resources 

we could be adversely affected by violations of antibribery anticorruption andor international trade laws 

we are subject to laws concerning our business operations and marketing activities in foreign countries where we conduct business for example we are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” us export control antimoney laundering and trade sanction laws and similar anticorruption and international trade laws in certain foreign countries such as the uk bribery act any violation of which could create substantial liability for us and also harm our reputation the fcpa generally prohibits us companies and their officers directors employees and intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment the fcpa also requires that us public companies maintain books and records that fairly and accurately reflect transactions and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls if we are found to have violated the fcpa or any other antibribery anticorruption or international trade laws we may face sanctions including civil and criminal fines disgorgement of profits and suspension or debarment of our ability to contract with governmental agencies or receive export 

 23   

licenses in addition new initiatives may be proposed from time to time that impact the trading conditions in certain countries or regions and may include retaliatory duties or trade sanctions which if enacted could adversely impact our trading relationships with vendors or other parties in such locations and have a material adverse effect on our operations from time to time we may face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign governmental agencies relating to our international business activities compliance with which could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations an adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could damage our reputation and subject us to fines or other penalties which could materially and adversely affect our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

we could be subject to adverse changes in tax laws regulations and interpretations or challenges to our tax positions 

we are a large corporation with operations in the us and numerous other jurisdictions around the world as such we are subject to tax laws and regulations of the us federal state and local governments as well as various foreign jurisdictions we compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate as the tax rates vary among jurisdictions a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision 

from time to time changes in tax laws or regulations may be proposed or enacted that could adversely affect our overall tax liability for example the us tax legislation enacted on december 22 2017 represents a significant overhaul of the us federal tax code this tax legislation significantly reduced the us statutory corporate tax rate and made other changes that could have a favorable impact on our overall us federal tax liability in a given period however the tax legislation also included a number of provisions including but not limited to the limitation or elimination of various deductions or credits including for interest expense and for performancebased compensation under section 162m the imposition of taxes on certain crossborder payments or transfers the changing of the timing of the recognition of certain income and deductions or their character and the limitation of asset basis under certain circumstances that could significantly and adversely affect our us federal income tax position the legislation also made significant changes to the tax rules applicable to insurance companies and other entities with which we do business we are continuing to evaluate the overall impact of this tax legislation on our operations and us federal income tax position there can be no assurance that changes in tax laws or regulations both within the us and the other jurisdictions in which we operate will not materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate tax payments financial condition and results of operations similarly changes in tax laws and regulations that impact our customers and counterparties or the economy generally may also impact our financial condition and results of operations 

tax laws and regulations are complex and subject to varying interpretations and we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative impact on our effective tax rate tax payments financial condition and results of operations in addition the determination of our income tax provision and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain although we believe our estimates are reasonable the ultimate tax determination may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our results of operations in the period or periods for which such determination is made any significant failure to comply with applicable tax laws and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions could give rise to substantial penalties and liabilities any changes in enacted tax laws such as the recent us tax legislation rules or regulatory or judicial interpretations or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could materially and adversely impact our effective tax rate tax payments financial condition and results of operations 

our insurance strategies may expose us to unexpected costs 

we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance to provide for potential liability for workers’ compensation automobile and general liability property director and officers’ liability and employee healthcare benefits provisions for losses related to selfinsured risks generally are based upon actuarially determined estimates any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability substantial unanticipated losses or liabilities including those due to natural disasters or otherwise as well as changes in legal claims trends and interpretations variability in inflation rates changes in the nature and method of claims settlement benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws insolvency of insurance carriers and changes in discount rates could all materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we could be adversely impacted by changes in assumptions used in calculating pension assets and liabilities 

we operate certain defined benefit pension plans in the united kingdom which were closed to new entrants in 2010 as well as smaller plans in other jurisdictions the valuation of the pension plan’s assets and liabilities depends in part on assumptions which are primarily based on the financial markets as well as longevity and employee retention rates this valuation is 

 24   

particularly sensitive to material changes in the value of equity bond and other investments held by the pension plans changes in the corporate bond yields which are used in the measurement of the liabilities changes in market expectations for longterm price inflation and new evidence on projected longevity rates funding requirements and the impact on the statement of earnings relating to these pension plans are also influenced by these factors adverse changes in the assumptions used to calculate the value of pension assets and liabilities including lower than expected pension fund investment returns andor increased life expectancy of plan participants or regulatory change could require us to increase the funding of its defined benefit pension plans or incur higher expenses which would adversely impact our results of operations and financial position 

certain stockholders may have significant voting influence over matters requiring stockholder approval 

as of september 30 2018 affiliates of stefano pessina our executive vice chairman and chief executive officer the “sp investors” had sole or shared voting power directly or indirectly over an aggregate of approximately 153 of our outstanding common stock the sp investors have agreed to for so long as they have the right to designate a nominee for election to the board to vote all of their shares of common stock in accordance with the board’s recommendation on matters submitted to a vote of the company’s stockholders including with respect to the election of directors the sp investors’ significant interest in our common stock potentially could determine the outcome of matters submitted to a vote by our stockholders the influence of the sp investors could result in the company taking actions that other stockholders do not support or failing to take actions that other stockholders support as a result the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected 

shares issued to former alliance boots stockholders in connection with our strategic combination with alliance boots are eligible for future sale 

the shares issued to the sp investors and certain other former alliance boots stockholders in connection with our strategic combination with alliance boots generally may now be sold pursuant to rule 144 under the securities act of 1933 as amended the “securities act” subject to restrictions in the case of shares held by persons deemed to be our affiliates and to certain obligations pursuant to a shareholders agreement as amended the “company shareholders agreement” with certain of the sp investors in addition the company shareholders agreement also contains registration rights that would obligate us in certain instances to file future registration statements under the securities act covering resales of shares issued to former alliance boots stockholders or to permit a “piggyback” on a future registration statement a sale or the perception that a sale may occur of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could adversely impact the market price of our common stock 

conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest may arise because certain of our directors and officers are also owners or directors of companies we may have dealings with 

conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest could arise between our interests and the interests of the other entities and business activities in which our directors or officers are involved for example potential conflicts of interest could arise if a dispute were to arise between the company and other parties to the company shareholders agreement including the sp investors mr pessina our executive vice chairman and chief executive officer indirectly controls alliance santé participations sa “asp” a privatelyheld company which is a party to the company shareholders agreement and he and his partner ornella barra our cochief operating officer serve as directors of asp there are other arrangements between affiliates of mr pessina and the company with required disclosures included in the company’s annual proxy statement conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest or similar issues could arise in connection with these or other transactions in the future while our contractual arrangements place restrictions on the parties’ conduct in certain situations and related party transactions are subject to independent review and approval in accordance with our related party transaction approval procedures and applicable law the potential for a conflict of interest exists and such persons may have conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting both companies 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws delaware law andor our agreements with certain stockholders may impede the ability of our stockholders to make changes to our board or impede a takeover 

certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as provisions of the delaware general corporation law the “dgcl” could make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the board or discourage delay or prevent a merger consolidation or acquisitions that stockholders may otherwise consider favorable these provisions include the authorization of the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that could be issued by the board limitations on the ability of stockholders to call special meetings and advance notice requirements for nomination for election to the board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings we are also subject to the provisions of section 203 of the dgcl which prohibits us except under specified circumstances from engaging in any mergers significant 

 25   

sales of stock or assets or business combinations with any stockholder or group of stockholders who own 15 or more of our common stock 

under the company shareholders agreement the sp investors are entitled to designate one nominee to the board currently stefano pessina for so long as the sp investors continue to meet certain beneficial ownership thresholds and subject to certain other conditions pursuant to the company shareholders agreement the sp investors have agreed that for so long as they have the right to designate a nominee to the board they will vote all of their shares of common stock in accordance with the board’s recommendation on matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders including with respect to the election of directors 

while these provisions do not make us immune from takeovers or changes in the composition of the board and are intended to protect our stockholders from among other things coercive or otherwise unfair tactics these provisions could have the effect of making it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the board or discouraging delaying or preventing a merger consolidation or acquisitions that stockholders may otherwise consider favorable see also the risk factor captioned “certain stockholders may have significant voting influence over matters requiring stockholder approval” above 

we cannot guarantee that our stock repurchase program will be fully implemented or that it will enhance longterm stockholder value 

in june 2018 our board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to 10 billion of our common stock the repurchase program does not have an expiration date and we are not obligated to repurchase a specified number or dollar value of shares on any particular timetable or at all there can be no assurance that we will repurchase stock at favorable prices the repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time and even if fully implemented may not enhance longterm stockholder value

see note 5  equity method investments  to the consolidated financial statements included herein for further information 

commitments and contingencies 

the information set forth in note 10  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this form 10k is incorporated herein by reference 

critical accounting policies 

the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and include amounts based on management’s prudent judgments and estimates actual results may differ from these estimates management believes that any reasonable deviation from those judgments and estimates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations to the extent that the estimates used differ from actual results however adjustments to the consolidated statements of earnings and corresponding consolidated balance sheets accounts would be necessary these adjustments would be made in future periods some of the more significant estimates include business combinations goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment cost of sales and inventory equity method investments pension and postretirement benefits and income taxes we use the following methods to determine our estimates 

  

business combinations   –  we account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that once control is obtained all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition the determination of fair values of assets and liabilities acquired requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available 

for intangible assets we generally use the income approach to determine fair value the income approach requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions primarily include but are not limited to discount rates terminal growth rates royalty rates forecasts of revenue operating income depreciation amortization and capital expenditures the discount rates applied to the projections reflect the risk factors associated with those projections 

although we believe our estimates of fair value are reasonable actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on the determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired 

 52   

judgment is also required in determining the intangible asset’s useful life 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment  – goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or intangible asset below its carrying value as part of our impairment analysis for each reporting unit we determine fair value for each reporting unit this determination includes estimating the fair value using both the income and market approaches the income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit including projected future operating results economic projections anticipated future cash flows and discount rates the market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping 

the determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions primarily include but are not limited to the selection of appropriate peer group companies control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we compete discount rates terminal growth rates forecasts of revenue operating income depreciation amortization and capital expenditures although we believe our estimates of fair value are reasonable actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units the amount of any goodwill impairment charge or both 

we also compared the sum of the estimated fair values of the reporting units to the company’s fair value as implied by the market value of the company’s equity securities this comparison indicated that in total our assumptions and estimates were reasonable however future declines in the overall market value of the company’s equity securities may indicate that the fair value of one or more reporting units has declined below its carrying value 

the fair values of the company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts ranging from approximately 11  to approximately 312  the fair value of our boots reporting unit within our retail pharmacy international division is in excess of its carrying value by approximately 11  we will continue to monitor the uk industry and market trends and the impact it may have on the boots reporting unit see note 6  goodwill and other intangible assets  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

  

indefinitelived intangible assets are tested by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 

our indefinitelived intangible assets fair values are estimated using the relief from royalty method and excess earnings method of the income approach these estimates can be affected by a number of factors including but not limited to general economic conditions availability of market information as well as our profitability 

cost of sales and inventory  – cost of sales includes the purchase price of goods and cost of services rendered store and warehouse inventory loss inventory obsolescence manufacturing costs and supplier rebates in addition to product costs cost of sales includes warehousing costs for retail operations purchasing costs freight costs cash discounts and vendor allowances cost of sales for our retail pharmacy usa segment is derived based upon pointofsale scanning information with an estimate for shrinkage and is adjusted based on periodic inventory counts inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market determined by the lastin firstout “lifo” method for the retail pharmacy usa segment and primarily on a firstin firstout “fifo” basis for inventory in the retail pharmacy international and pharmaceutical wholesale segments 

  

equity method investments   – we use the equity method of accounting for equity investments in companies if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence but not control over operating and financial policies of the investee our proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies is included in consolidated net earnings judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as our ownership interest representation on the board of directors participation in policymaking decisions and material purchase and sale transactions 

we evaluate equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable factors considered when reviewing an equity method investment for impairment include the length of time duration and the extent severity to which the fair value of the equity method investment has been less than cost the investee’s financial condition and nearterm prospects and the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery an impairment that is otherthantemporary is recognized in the period identified

pension and postretirement benefits  – we have various defined benefit pension plans that cover some of our nonus employees we also have a postretirement healthcare plan that covers qualifying us employees eligibility and the level of benefits for these plans vary depending on participants’ status date of hire and or length of service our pension and postretirement plan expenses and valuations are dependent on assumptions used by thirdparty actuaries in calculating those amounts these assumptions include discount rates healthcare cost trends longterm rate of return on plan assets retirement rates mortality rates and other factors in determining our longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption we consider both the historical performance of the investment portfolio as well as the longterm market return expectations based on the investment mix of the portfolio a change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on our projected benefit obligation and pension expense a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in a decline of 354 million to our pension benefit obligation a 25 basis point decrease on the expected return on plan assets assumption would increase our pension expense by 21 million 

our policy is to fund our pension plans in accordance with applicable regulations our postretirement healthcare plan is not funded 

  

income taxes  – we are subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business us federal state local and foreign tax authorities raise questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions in evaluating the tax benefits associated with our various tax filing positions we record a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized adjustments are made to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which we determine the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities the statute of limitations expires for the return containing the tax position or when more information becomes available our liability for unrecognized tax benefits including accrued penalties and interest is primarily included in other noncurrent liabilities and current income taxes on our consolidated balance sheets and in income tax provision in our consolidated statements of earnings 

  

in determining our provision for income taxes we use income permanent differences between book and tax income and enacted statutory income tax rates the provision for income taxes rate also reflects our assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits in addition to any foreignbased income deemed to be taxable in the united states discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

interest rate risk 

the company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to existing debt issuances primary exposures include libor and commercial paper rates from time to time the company uses interest rate swaps and forwardstarting interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to the impact of interest rate changes on existing debt and future debt issuances respectively to reduce the volatility of financing costs and based on current and projected market conditions achieve a desired proportion of fixed versus floatingrate debt generally under these swaps the company agrees with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixedrate and floatingrate interest amounts based on an agreed upon notional principal amount 

information regarding our transactions are set forth in note 8  financial instruments  to the consolidated financial statements these financial instruments are sensitive to changes in interest rates on august 31 2018  the company had no material longterm debt obligations that had floating interest rates the amounts exclude the impact of any associated derivative contracts

the company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily with respect to the british pound sterling and euro   and certain other foreign currencies which may affect its net investment in foreign subsidiaries and may cause fluctuations in cash flows related to foreign denominated transactions the company is also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the us dollar the company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on nonfunctional currency cash flows these transactions are almost exclusively less than 12 months in maturity in addition the company enters into foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated in hedging relationships to offset in part the impacts of certain intercompany activities primarily associated with intercompany financing transactions 

the company’s foreign currency derivative instruments are sensitive to changes in exchange rates a hypothetical 1 change in foreign currency exchange rates versus the us dollar would change the fair value of the foreign currency derivative held as of august 31 2018  by approximately 21 million the foreign currency derivatives are intended to partially hedge anticipated transactions foreign currency trade payables and receivables and net investments in foreign subsidiaries

industry overview 

the retail pharmacy and pharmaceutical wholesale industries across the globe are highly competitive and have been experiencing consolidation in recent years prescription drugs play a significant role in healthcare and constitute a first line of treatment for many medical conditions we believe the longterm outlook for prescription drug utilization is strong due in part to aging populations increases in life expectancy increases in the availability and utilization of generic drugs the continued development of innovative drugs that improve quality of life and control healthcare costs and increases in the number of persons with insurance coverage for prescription drugs including in the united states “baby boomers” increasingly becoming eligible for the federally funded medicare part d prescription program pharmaceutical wholesalers act as a vital link between drug manufacturers and pharmacies and healthcare providers in supplying pharmaceuticals to patients 

the retail pharmacy industry across the globe relies significantly on private and governmental third party payers many private organizations throughout the healthcare industry including pharmacy benefit management “pbm” companies and health insurance companies have consolidated in recent years to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater bargaining power third party payers including the medicare part d plans and the statesponsored medicaid and related managed care medicaid agencies in the united states can change eligibility requirements or reduce certain reimbursement rates in addition in many european countries the government provides or subsidizes healthcare to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices patient eligibility and reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored healthcare system changes in law or regulation also can impact reimbursement rates and terms for example the patient protection and affordable care act the 

 3   

“aca” was enacted to help control federal healthcare spending including for prescription drugs in the united states and the uk department of health plans to implement funding cuts to reduce costs within the national health service by reducing drug reimbursement rates these changes generally are expected to reduce medicaid reimbursements in the united states and pharmacy reimbursements in the uk state medicaid programs are also expected to continue to seek reductions in reimbursements when third party payers or governmental authorities take actions that restrict eligibility or reduce prices or reimbursement rates sales and margins in the retail pharmacy industry could be reduced which would adversely affect industry profitability in some cases these possible adverse effects may be partially or entirely offset by controlling inventory costs and other expenses dispensing more higher margin generics finding new revenue streams through pharmacy services or other offerings andor dispensing a greater volume of prescriptions 

generic prescription drugs have continued to help lower overall costs for customers and third party payers we expect the utilization of generic pharmaceuticals to continue to increase in general in the united states generic versions of drugs generate lower sales dollars per prescription but higher gross profit dollars as compared with patentprotected brand name drugs the impact on retail pharmacy gross profit dollars can be significant in the first several months after a generic version of a drug is first allowed to compete with the branded version which is generally referred to as a “generic conversion” in any given year the number of major brand name drugs that undergo a conversion from branded to generic status can vary and the timing of generic conversions can be difficult to predict which can have a significant impact on retail pharmacy sales and gross profit dollars 

we expect that market demand government regulation thirdparty reimbursement policies government contracting requirements and other pressures will continue to cause the industries in which we compete to evolve pharmacists are on the frontlines of the healthcare delivery system and we believe rising healthcare costs and the limited supply of primary care physicians present new opportunities for pharmacists and retail pharmacies to play an even greater role in driving positive outcomes for patients and payers through expanded service offerings such as immunizations and other preventive care healthcare clinics pharmacistled medication therapy management and chronic condition management

we filled 7644 million  prescriptions including immunizations in the division in fiscal 2017  adjusted to 30day equivalents prescriptions filled were 9897 million  in fiscal 2017  sales where reimbursement is received from managed care organizations governmental agencies pbm companies and private insurance were approximately 98  of the division’s fiscal 2017  pharmacy sales 

we fill prescriptions for many state medicaid public assistance programs sales from all such medicaid plans were approximately 4  of the division’s fiscal 2017  sales sales from medicare part d plans were approximately 19  of the division’s fiscal 2017  sales 

our us loyalty program balance® rewards is designed to reward our most valuable customers and encourage shopping in stores and online balance® rewards members receive special pricing on select products and earn everyday rewards points for purchasing most merchandise that can be instantly redeemed at our stores or through walgreenscom as of august 31 2017  the number of active balance® rewards members totaled 882 million  for this purpose we define an active member as someone who has used their card in the last six months 

amerisourcebergen supplies and distributes a significant amount of generic and branded pharmaceutical products to the division’s pharmacies we purchase our nonpharmaceutical merchandise from numerous manufacturers and wholesalers 

the division’s sales gross profit margin and gross profit are impacted by among other things both the percentage of prescriptions that we fill that are generic and the rate at which new generic drugs are introduced to the market because any number of factors outside of our control can affect timing for a generic conversion we face substantial uncertainty in predicting when such conversions will occur and what effect they will have on particular future periods 

the current environment of our pharmacy business also includes ongoing reimbursement pressure and a shift in pharmacy mix towards 90day at retail one prescription that is the equivalent of three 30day prescriptions and medicare part d prescriptions further consolidation among generic manufacturers coupled with changes in the number of major brand name drugs anticipated to undergo a conversion from branded to generic status may also result in gross margin pressures within the industry 

we continuously face reimbursement pressure from pbm companies health maintenance organizations managed care organizations and other commercial third party payers our agreements with these payers are regularly subject to expiration termination or renegotiation in addition plan changes with rate adjustments often occur in january and our reimbursement arrangements may provide for rate adjustments at prescribed intervals during their term we experienced lower reimbursement rates in fiscal 2017  as compared to the same period in the prior year we expect these pressures to continue 

we also have worked to develop and expand our relationships with commercial third party payers to enable new andor improved market access via participation in pharmacy provider networks they offer the prescription volume impact of new agreements and relationships typically is incremental over time 

our 90day at retail prescription drug offering is typically at a lower margin than comparable 30day prescriptions but provides us with the opportunity to increase business with patients with chronic prescription needs while offering increased convenience helping facilitate improved prescription adherence and resulting in a lower cost to fill the 90day prescription

retail pharmacy international 

our retail pharmacy international division excluding equity method investments has pharmacyled health and beauty retail businesses in eight  countries each focused on helping people look and feel their best we operated 4722  retail stores in the division as of august 31 2017  see properties in part i item 2 below for information regarding geographic coverage and have grown our online presence significantly in recent years our principal retail pharmacy brands are boots in the united kingdom thailand norway the republic of ireland and the netherlands benavides in mexico and ahumada in chile in europe we are a market leader and our retail stores are conveniently located and our pharmacists are well placed to provide a significant role in the provision of healthcare services working closely with other primary healthcare providers in the communities we serve 

the boots omnichannel offering is differentiated from that of competitors due to the product brands we own such as no7 boots pharmaceuticals soap  glory liz earle sleek makeup botanics and ‘only at boots’ exclusive products together with our long established reputation for trust and customer care our brands portfolio is enhanced by our inhouse product research and development capabilities 

our retail store networks are typically complemented by online platforms in the united kingdom through the bootscom website and integrated mobile application our ‘order and collect’ service allows customers to order from a range of over 35000  products by 800 pm and collect from noon the following day from approximately 99  of the united kingdom’s retail stores as of august 31 2017  

the boots advantage card loyalty program where customers earn points on purchases for redemption at a later date continues to be a key element of the boots offering as of august 31 2017  the number of active boots advantage card members totaled 155 million  for this purpose we define an active member as someone who has used their card in the last six months 

in addition boots in the united kingdom is one of the leaders in the optical market with 637  practices of which 178  operated on a franchise basis as of august 31 2017  approximately 30  of these optical practices are located in boots stores with the balance being standalone optical practices 

the components of the division’s sales are pharmacy typically the sale of prescription drugs and provision of pharmacyrelated services subject to variation in particular jurisdictions depending upon regulatory and other factors and retail primarily the sale of health and beauty products including beauty toiletries and lifestyle merchandising nonprescription drugs and in the united kingdom the provision of optical services 

the division’s sales are subject to the influence of seasonality with the second fiscal quarter typically the strongest as a result of the winter holiday period this seasonality affects the division’s proportion of sales between retail and pharmacy during certain periods the components of the division’s fiscal year sales were as follows 



1 fiscal 2015 includes periods subsequent to the second step transaction january through august 2015 

the division’s retail sales gross profit margin and gross profit dollars are impacted by among other things the highly competitive nature of the health and beauty category specifically our and our competitors pricing actions promotional offers and events and our customer’s desire for value and convenience 

the division’s pharmacy sales gross margin and gross profit dollars are impacted by governmental agencies and other third party payers seeking to minimize increases in the costs of healthcare including pharmaceutical drug reimbursement rates in the united kingdom which is the division’s largest market for pharmacy sales the amount of government funding available for pharmacy services is typically reviewed and agreed with the pharmacy industry on an annual basis in fiscal 2018  the uk department of health has indicated that they plan to implement funding cuts to reduce costs within the national health service the publiclyfunded healthcare system 

in addition performance as measured in us dollars is impacted by the exchange rates used to translate these amounts into us dollars the exchange rate of british pound sterling being the most significant

pharmaceutical wholesale 

our pharmaceutical wholesale division excluding equity method investments which mainly operates under the alliance healthcare brand supplies medicines other healthcare products and related services to more than 110000  pharmacies doctors health centers and hospitals each year from 289  distribution centers in 11  countries primarily in europe as of august 31   2017  

the distribution of prescription medicines to pharmacists comprises the vast majority of the division’s sales our wholesale businesses seek to provide high core service levels to pharmacists in terms of frequency of delivery product availability delivery accuracy timeliness and reliability at competitive prices we also offer customers innovative addedvalue services to help pharmacists develop their own businesses this includes membership of alphega pharmacy our paneuropean network for independent pharmacies which as of august 31 2017  had over 6300  members 

in addition to the wholesale of medicines and other healthcare products our businesses provide services to pharmaceutical manufacturers which are increasingly seeking to gain greater control over their product distribution while at the same time outsourcing noncore activities these services include prewholesale and contract logistics mainly under the alloga brand direct deliveries to pharmacies and innovative and specialized healthcare services covering clinical homecare medicine support dispensing services medicine preparation and clinical trial support mainly under the alcura brand 

combined with local engagement scale is important in pharmaceutical wholesaling we are one of the largest pharmaceutical wholesalers and distributors in europe and we rank as one of the top three in market share in many of the individual countries in which we operate 

the division’s sales gross profit margin and gross profit dollars are impacted by among other things government actions which typically seek to reduce the growth in prescription drug consumption reduce reimbursement rates and increase generic drug utilization a greater proportion of generic drugs whether as a result of government actions generic conversions or other factors typically has an adverse effect on our revenues however in the wholesale division we typically earn equal or better gross margins on generic drugs than on branded drugs although there are exceptions 

changes in manufacturers’ product distribution business models can also impact the division’s sales and gross margin for example when pharmaceutical drug manufacturers introduce feeforservice contracts it reduces our sales even if we are successful in winning these contracts as we only recognize sales for the amount of the fees charged other manufacturer services including our prewholesale and contract logistics operations are typically on a feeforservice basis 

in addition performance as measured in us dollars is impacted by the exchange rates used to translate these amounts into us dollars the exchange rate of british pounds sterling and the euro being the most significant the division’s sales are subject to less seasonality than our other divisions 

intellectual property and licenses 

we market products and services under various trademarks trade dress and trade names and rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark service mark and trade secret laws as well as contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights we own numerous domain names hold numerous patents have registered numerous trademarks and have filed applications for the registration of a number of our other trademarks and service marks in various jurisdictions we hold assorted business licenses such as pharmacy occupational liquor and cigarette having various lives within multiple legal jurisdictions which are necessary for the normal operation of our business 

seasonal variations in business 

our business is affected by a number of factors including among others our sales performance during holiday periods including particularly the winter holiday season and during the cough cold and flu season the timing and severity of which is difficult to predict significant weather conditions the timing of our own or competitor discount programs and pricing actions and the timing of changes in levels of reimbursement from governmental agencies and other third party payers see summary of quarterly results unaudited in note 19 supplementary financial information to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 below 

sources and availability of raw materials 

inventories are purchased from numerous domestic and foreign suppliers we do not believe that the loss of any one supplier or group of suppliers under common control would have a material adverse effect on our business or that of any of our divisions 

 7   

working capital practices 

effective inventory management is important to our operations we use various inventory management techniques including demand forecasting and planning and various forms of replenishment management our working capital needs typically are greater in the months leading up to the winter holiday season we generally finance our inventory and expansion needs with internally generated funds and shortterm borrowings for additional information see the liquidity and capital resources section in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii item 7 below 

customers 

we sell to numerous retail and wholesale customers no single customer accounted for more than 10 of the company’s consolidated sales for any of the periods presented two payers accounted for approximately 25  of the retail pharmacy usa division’s sales in fiscal 2017  one payer in the retail pharmacy international division accounted for approximately 18  of the division’s sales in fiscal 2017  

regulation 

in the countries in which we do business we are subject to national state and local laws regulations and administrative practices concerning retail and wholesale pharmacy operations including regulations relating to our participation in medicare medicaid and other publicly financed health benefit plans regulations prohibiting kickbacks beneficiary inducement and the submission of false claims the health insurance portability and accountability act “hipaa” the aca licensure and registration requirements concerning the operation of pharmacies and the practice of pharmacy and regulations of the us food and drug administration the us federal trade commission the us drug enforcement administration and the us consumer product safety commission as well as regulations promulgated by comparable foreign state and local governmental authorities concerning the operation of our businesses we are also subject to laws and regulations relating to licensing tax foreign trade intellectual property privacy and data protection currency political and other business restrictions

competitive conditions 

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive as a leader in the retail pharmacy industry and as a retailer of general merchandise we compete with various local regional national and global retailers including chain and independent pharmacies mail order prescription providers grocery stores convenience stores mass merchants online and omnichannel pharmacies and retailers warehouse clubs dollar stores and other discount merchandisers our pharmaceutical wholesale businesses compete with other pharmaceutical wholesalers as well as alternative supply sources such as importers and manufacturers who supply directly to pharmacies we compete primarily on the basis of service convenience variety and price our geographic dispersion helps mitigate the impact of temporary localized economic and competitive conditions in individual markets see “properties” in part i item 2 below for further information regarding our geographic dispersion 

employees 

as of august 31 2017  we employed approximately 345000  persons approximately 110000  of whom were parttime employees working less than 30 hours per week the foregoing does not include employees of unconsolidated partiallyowned entities

available information 

we file with the securities and exchange commission the “sec” our annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and any amendments to those reports as well as proxy statements and registration statements you may read and copy any material we file with the sec at the sec’s public reference room at 100 f street ne washington dc 20549 you may also obtain information on the operation of the public reference room by calling the sec at 1800sec0330 in addition the sec maintains a website at httpwwwsecgov that contains reports proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers including us that file electronically we make available free of charge on or through our website at httpinvestorwalgreensbootsalliancecom our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a or 15d of the exchange act as soon as reasonably practicable after we file or furnish them to the sec the contents of our website are not however a part of this form 10k or our other sec filings 




 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information in this report and our other filings with the sec you should carefully consider the risks described below which could materially and adversely affect our business operations financial condition and results of operations these risks are not the only risks that we face our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial 

reductions in third party reimbursement levels from private or governmental agency plans and potential changes in industry pricing benchmarks for prescription drugs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

the substantial majority of the prescriptions we fill are reimbursed by third party payers including private and governmental agency payers the continued efforts of health maintenance organizations managed care organizations pbm companies governmental agencies and other third party payers to reduce prescription drug costs and pharmacy reimbursement rates as well as litigation and other legal proceedings relating to how drugs are priced may adversely impact our results of operations in the united states plan changes with rate adjustments often occur in january and our reimbursement arrangements may provide for rate adjustments at prescribed intervals during their term in addition in an environment where some pbm clients utilize narrow or restricted pharmacy provider networks some of these entities may offer pricing terms that we may not be willing to accept or otherwise restrict our participation in their networks of pharmacy providers 

changes in political economic and regulatory influences also may significantly affect healthcare financing and prescription drug reimbursement practices in the united states for example there have been multiple attempts through legislative action and legal challenges to repeal or amend the aca in whole and in part we cannot predict whether current or future efforts to repeal or amend these laws will be successful nor can we predict the impact that such a repeal or amendment and any subsequent legislation would have on our business and reimbursement levels there have also been a number of other proposals and enactments by the federal government and various states to reduce medicare part d and medicaid reimbursement levels in response to budget deficits and we expect additional proposals in the future there can be no assurance that recent or future changes in prescription drug reimbursement policies and practices will not materially and adversely affect our results of operations in many countries where we have operations the government provides or subsidizes healthcare to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices patient eligibility and reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored healthcare system efforts to control healthcare costs including prescription drug costs are continuous and reductions in third party reimbursement levels could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

in addition many payers in the united states are increasingly considering new metrics as the basis for reimbursement rates such as average sales price average manufacturer price and actual acquisition cost it is possible that the pharmaceutical industry or regulators may evaluate andor develop an alternative pricing reference to replace average wholesale price which is the pricing reference used for many of our contracts in addition many state medicaid feeforservice programs moved to establish pharmacy network payments on the basis of actual acquisition cost by april 1 2017 which potentially could have an impact on reimbursement practices in other commercial and government arrangements future changes to the pricing benchmarks used to establish pharmaceutical pricing including changes in the basis for calculating reimbursement by third party payers could adversely affect us 

a shift in pharmacy mix toward lower margin plans and programs could adversely affect our results of operations 

our retail pharmacy usa division seeks to grow prescription volume while operating in a marketplace with continuous reimbursement pressure a shift in the mix of pharmacy prescription volume towards programs offering lower reimbursement rates could adversely affect our results of operations for example our retail pharmacy usa division has experienced a shift in pharmacy mix towards 90day at retail in recent years our 90day at retail offering for patients with chronic prescription 

 9   

needs typically is at a lower margin than comparable 30day prescriptions our retail pharmacy usa division also experienced a shift in pharmacy mix towards medicare part d prescriptions in fiscal 2017 and that trend may continue preferred medicare part d networks have increased in number in recent years however we do not participate in all such networks we have accepted lower reimbursement rates in order to secure preferred relationships with medicare part d plans serving senior patients with significant pharmacy needs we also have worked to develop and expand our relationships with commercial third party payers to enable new andor improved market access via participation in the pharmacy provider networks they offer if we are not able to generate additional prescription volume and other business from patients participating in these programs that is sufficient to offset the impact of lower reimbursement or if the degree or terms of our participation in such preferred networks declines from current levels in future years our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we could be adversely affected by a decrease in the introduction of new brand name and generic prescription drugs as well as increases in the cost to procure prescription drugs 

the profitability of our pharmacy businesses depends upon the utilization of prescription drugs utilization trends are affected by among other factors the introduction of new and successful prescription drugs as well as lowerpriced generic alternatives to existing brand name drugs inflation in the price of drugs also can adversely affect utilization particularly given the increased prevalence of highdeductible health insurance plans and related plan design changes new brand name drugs can result in increased drug utilization and associated sales while the introduction of lower priced generic alternatives typically results in relatively lower sales but relatively higher gross profit margins accordingly a decrease in the number or magnitude of significant new brand name drugs or generics successfully introduced delays in their introduction or a decrease in the utilization of previously introduced prescription drugs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

in addition if we experience an increase in the amounts we pay to procure pharmaceutical drugs including generic drugs it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations our gross profit margins would be adversely affected to the extent we are not able to offset such cost increases any failure to fully offset any such increased prices and costs or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations additionally any future changes in drug prices could be significantly different than our expectations 

we derive a significant portion of our sales in the united states from prescription drug sales reimbursed by a limited number of pharmacy benefit management companies 

we derive a significant portion of our sales in the united states from prescription drug sales reimbursed through prescription drug plans administered by a limited number of pbm companies pbm companies typically administer multiple prescription drug plans that expire at various times and provide for varying reimbursement rates and often limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list known as a formulary which might not include all of the approved drugs for a particular indication there can be no assurance that we will continue to participate in any particular pbm company’s pharmacy provider network in any particular future time period if our participation in the pharmacy provider network for a prescription drug plan administered by one or more of the large pbm companies is restricted or terminated we expect that our sales would be adversely affected at least in the shortterm if we are unable to replace any such lost sales either through an increase in other sales or through a resumption of participation in those plans our operating results could be materially and adversely affected if we exit a pharmacy provider network and later resume participation there can be no assurance that we will achieve any particular level of business on any particular pace or that all clients of the pbm company will choose to include us again in the pharmacy network for their plans initially or at all in addition in such circumstances we may incur increased marketing and other costs in connection with initiatives to regain former patients and attract new patients covered by such plans 

consolidation and strategic alliances in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business operations competitive positioning financial condition and results of operations 

many organizations in the healthcare industry including pbm companies have consolidated in recent years to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater bargaining power which has resulted in greater pricing pressures if this consolidation trend continues it could give the resulting enterprises even greater bargaining power which may lead to further pressure on the prices for our products and services if these pressures result in reductions in our prices our businesses would become less profitable unless we are able to achieve corresponding reductions in costs or develop profitable new revenue streams 

new partnerships and strategic alliances in the healthcare industry also can alter market dynamics and impact our businesses and competitive positioning for example following the entry into our strategic relationship with amerisourcebergen providing for among other things generic drug purchasing through our global sourcing enterprise some of our retail pharmacy competitors subsequently established relationships with other pharmaceutical drug wholesalers and others relating to generic drug procurement changes in the participants in such global sourcing enterprises whether as a result of mergers acquisitions 

 10   

or other transactions can have a similar effect in addition further consolidation among generic drug manufacturers could lead to generic drug inflation in the future we expect that market demand government regulation thirdparty reimbursement policies government contracting requirements and other pressures will continue to cause the healthcare industry to evolve potentially resulting in further business consolidations and alliances and increased vertical integration among the industry participants we engage with and which could if we are not able to successfully anticipate and respond to evolving industry conditions in a timely and effective manner materially and adversely impact our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

our growth strategy is partially dependent upon our ability to identify and successfully complete acquisitions joint ventures and other strategic alliances 

a significant element of our growth strategy is to identify pursue and successfully complete acquisitions joint ventures and other strategic alliances that either expand or complement our existing operations we have grown significantly through acquisitions in recent years and expect to continue to acquire partner with or invest in businesses that build on or are deemed complementary to our existing businesses or further our strategic objectives due in part to consolidation in the industries in which we compete there is significant competition for attractive targets and opportunities when available there can be no assurance that attractive acquisition or other strategic relationship opportunities will be available that we will be successful in identifying negotiating and consummating favorable transaction opportunities or that any such transactions we complete will be successful and justify our investment of financial and other resources therein 

acquisitions and other strategic transactions involve numerous risks including difficulties in successfully integrating the operations and personnel distraction of management from overseeing and disruption of our existing operations difficulties in entering markets or lines of business in which we have no or limited direct prior experience the possible loss of key employees and customers and difficulties in achieving the synergies we anticipated any failure to select suitable opportunities at fair prices conduct appropriate due diligence and successfully integrate the acquired company including particularly when acquired businesses operate in new geographic markets or areas of business could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations these transactions may also cause us to significantly increase our interest expense leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition or investment issue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders’ percentage ownership or incur asset writeoffs and restructuring costs and other related expenses that could have a material adverse impact on our operating results acquisitions joint ventures and strategic investments also involve numerous other risks including potential exposure to assumed litigation and unknown environmental and other liabilities as well as undetected internal control regulatory or other issues or additional costs not anticipated at the time the transaction was completed no assurance can be given that our acquisitions joint ventures and other strategic alliances will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business operations financial condition or results of operations if we are unable to successfully identify complete and integrate acquisitions joint ventures and strategic investments in a timely and effective manner our business operations and growth strategies could be negatively affected 

our strategic relationships include outsourcing and similar relationships we outsource certain business and administrative functions and rely on third parties to perform certain services on our behalf for example in july 2017 we announced a binding offer from fareva for a 10year global agreement for the manufacture and supply of own beauty brands and private label products under the terms of the proposed agreement fareva will take ownership of bcm walgreens boots alliance’s contract manufacturing business which operates factories in the united kingdom france and germany the proposed agreement which is subject to certain closing conditions is expected to be completed by the end of calendar year 2017 we rely on these third parties to meet our quality and performance requirements and to timely perform as expected we periodically negotiate provisions and renewals of these relationships and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to us or such third parties if our continuing relationship with certain thirdparty providers is interrupted or if such thirdparty providers experience disruptions or do not perform as anticipated or we experience problems with any transition we may experience operational difficulties reputational harm and increased costs that could materially and adversely affect our business operations and results of operations 

we may not be able to successfully or timely complete the acquisition of certain rite aid assets 

risks and uncertainties related to our acquisition of 1932 stores three distribution centers and related inventory from rite aid pursuant to the amended and restated asset purchase agreement include among others the occurrence of any event change or other circumstance that could impact our ability to complete the closing conditions set forth in the amended and restated asset purchase agreement including that litigation may be filed which could prevent or delay completion of the transaction and that uncertainty regarding the transaction may adversely affect relationships with suppliers payers customers and other third parties while we have completed the acquisition of the first few rite aid stores pursuant to the amended and restated asset purchase agreement as of the date of this report ownership of stores is expected to be transferred in phases with the 

 11   

goal being to complete the store transfers in spring 2018 completion of the remaining asset acquisition transactions is subject to the satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in the amended and restated asset purchase agreement we will be unable to complete the acquisition of these rite aid assets until each of the conditions to closing is either satisfied or waived we have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the transaction as well as the diversion of management resources for which we will receive little or no benefit if the closing of the remaining asset acquisitions do not occur 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of certain rite aid assets pursuant to the amended and restated asset purchase agreement which could adversely impact our results of operations 

we entered into the amended and restated asset purchase agreement to acquire certain rite aid stores and distribution centers with the expectation that the transaction will result in various benefits including among other things cost savings and operating efficiencies the achievement of the anticipated benefits of the transaction is subject to a number of uncertainties including whether the acquired assets can be integrated into our business in an efficient and effective manner the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding potential synergies and the integration process unforeseen expenses or delays and competitive factors in the marketplace we can provide no assurance that the anticipated benefits of the transaction including cost savings and synergies will be fully realized in the time frame anticipated or at all the costs or difficulties related to the integration of the acquired assets into our business and operations will not be greater than expected unanticipated costs charges and expenses will not result from the transaction litigation relating to the transaction will not be filed and the transaction will not cause disruption to the parties’ business and operations and relationships with employees and suppliers payers customers and other third parties if one or more of these risks are realized it could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 

we could also encounter unforeseen transaction and integrationrelated costs or other circumstances such as unforeseen liabilities or other issues resulting from the transaction many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs decreased revenue decreased synergies and the diversion of management time and attention which could adversely impact our agility to respond to market opportunities and our ability to timely identify and implement other strategic actions if we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame or at all the expected benefits may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations financial condition and results of operations in addition we have incurred significant transaction costs related to the transaction and expect to continue to incur significant integration and related costs as we integrate the acquired rite aid assets these integration and acquisitionrelated costs including legal accounting financial and tax advisory and other fees and costs may be higher than expected and some of these costs may be material 

our substantial international business operations subject us to a number of operating economic political regulatory and other international business risks 

our substantial international business operations are important to our growth and prospects including particularly those of our retail pharmacy international and pharmaceutical wholesale divisions and are subject to a number of risks including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 12   

 

 

 

 

these factors can also adversely affect our payers vendors and customers in international markets which in turn can negatively impact our businesses we cannot assure you that one or more of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations results of operation and financial condition 

many of these factors are subject to change based on changes in political economic and regulatory influences for example 

 

 

there can be no assurance that any or all of these developments will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations results of operations and financial condition 

we are exposed to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

our significant operations outside of the united states expose us to currency exchange rate fluctuations and related risks including transaction currency exposures relating to the import and export of goods in currencies other than businesses’ functional currencies as well as currency translation exposures relating to profits and net assets denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we present our financial statements in us dollars and have a significant proportion of net assets and income in nonus dollar currencies primarily the british pound sterling and the euro as well as a range of other foreign currencies our results of operations and capital ratios can therefore be sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future results of operations in addition fluctuations in currencies relative to the us dollar may make it more difficult to perform periodtoperiod comparisons of our reported results of operations a depreciation of nonus dollar currencies relative to the us dollar could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations 

 13   

we may from time to time in some instances enter into foreign currency contracts or other derivative instruments intended to hedge a portion of our foreign currency fluctuation risks which subjects us to additional risks such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations to us that could materially and adversely affect us additionally we may and currently do use foreign currency borrowings to hedge some of our foreign currency fluctuation risks the periodic use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place we cannot assure you that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates including particularly the strengthening of the us dollar against major currencies or the currencies of large developing countries will not materially affect our consolidated financial results 

our business results depend on our ability to successfully manage ongoing organizational change and business transformation and achieve cost savings and operating efficiency initiatives 

our board of directors approved the plan to implement the store optimization program described in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii item 7 below as part of an initiative to reduce costs and increase operating efficiencies there can be no assurance that we will realize in full or in part the anticipated benefits of this program our financial goals assume a level of productivity improvement including those reflected in the store optimization program and other business optimization initiatives if we are unable to deliver these expected productivity improvements while continuing to invest in business growth or if the volume and nature of change overwhelms available resources our business operations and financial results could be materially and adversely impacted our ability to successfully manage and execute these initiatives and realize expected savings and benefits in the amounts and at the times anticipated is important to our business success any failure to do so which could result from our inability to successfully execute organizational change and business transformation plans changes in global or regional economic conditions competition changes in the industries in which we compete unanticipated costs or charges loss of key personnel and other factors described herein could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition and results of operations 

disruption in our global supply chain could negatively impact our businesses 

the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors and any future disruption in our supply chain or inability to find qualified vendors and access products that meet requisite quality and safety standards in a timely and efficient manner could adversely impact our businesses the loss or disruption of such supply arrangements for any reason including for issues such as labor disputes loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites inability to procure sufficient raw materials quality control issues ethical sourcing issues a supplier’s financial distress natural disasters civil unrest or acts of war or terrorism trade sanctions or other external factors over which we have no control could interrupt product supply and if not effectively managed and remedied have a material adverse impact on our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

we use a single wholesaler of branded and generic pharmaceutical drugs as our primary source of such products for our retail pharmacy usa division 

in march 2013 walgreens alliance boots and amerisourcebergen announced various agreements and arrangements including a tenyear pharmaceutical distribution agreement between walgreens and amerisourcebergen pursuant to which we source branded and generic pharmaceutical products from amerisourcebergen in the us and an agreement which provides amerisourcebergen the ability to access generics pharmaceutical products through our global sourcing enterprise in may 2016 certain of these agreements were extended for three years to now expire in 2026 in addition in march 2013 walgreens alliance boots and amerisourcebergen entered into agreements and arrangements pursuant to which we have the right but not the obligation to purchase a minority equity position in amerisourcebergen and gain associated representation on amerisourcebergen’s board of directors in certain circumstances as of the date of this report amerisourcebergen distributes for our retail pharmacy usa division substantially all branded and generic pharmaceutical products consequently our business in the united states may be adversely affected by any operational financial or regulatory difficulties that amerisourcebergen experiences for example if amerisourcebergen’s operations are seriously disrupted for any reason whether due to a natural disaster labor disruption regulatory action computer or operational systems or otherwise it could adversely affect our business in the united states and our results of operations 

our distribution agreement with amerisourcebergen is subject to early termination in certain circumstances and upon the expiration or termination of the agreement there can be no assurance that we or amerisourcebergen will be willing to renew the agreement or enter into a new agreement on terms favorable to us or at all if such expiration or termination occurred we believe that alternative sources of supply for most generic and brandname pharmaceuticals are readily available and that we could obtain and qualify alternative sources which may include selfdistribution in some cases for substantially all of the prescription drugs we sell on an acceptable basis such that the impact of any such expiration or termination would be 

 14   

temporary however there can be no assurance we would be able to engage alternative supply sources or implement selfdistribution processes on a timely basis or on terms favorable to us or effectively manage these transitions any of which could adversely affect our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

the anticipated strategic and financial benefits of our relationship with amerisourcebergen may not be realized 

we entered into the arrangement with amerisourcebergen with the expectation that the transactions contemplated thereby would result in various benefits including among other things procurement cost savings and operating efficiencies innovation and sharing of best practices the processes and initiatives needed to achieve these potential benefits are complex costly and timeconsuming many of the anticipated synergies and expenses that will be incurred by their nature are difficult to estimate accurately at the present time achieving the anticipated benefits from the arrangement is subject to a number of significant challenges and uncertainties including the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations processes or initiatives or the inability to realize andor delays in realizing potential benefits and synergies whether unique corporate cultures of separate organizations will work collaboratively in an efficient and effective manner unforeseen expenses or delays and competitive factors in the marketplace 

as of august 31 2017 we beneficially owned approximately 26 of the outstanding amerisourcebergen common stock and had designated one member of amerisourcebergen’s board of directors in addition we have the right but not the obligation under the transactions contemplated by the framework agreement dated as of march 18 2013 by and among the company alliance boots and amerisourcebergen the “framework agreement” to acquire up to an additional 8398752 amerisourcebergen shares in the open market and thereafter designate another member of amerisourcebergen’s board of directors subject in each case to applicable legal and contractual requirements there can be no assurance that we will complete any specific level of such potential equity investments in amerisourcebergen or that our existing investment or any future investment if completed will ultimately be profitable if the price of amerisourcebergen common stock subsequently declines substantially we could experience a loss on or impairment of such investment which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations further our ability to transact in amerisourcebergen securities is subject to certain restrictions set forth in our agreements with amerisourcebergen and arising under applicable laws and regulations which in some circumstances could adversely our ability to transact in amerisourcebergen securities in amounts and at the times desired we could also encounter unforeseen costs circumstances or issues existing or arising with respect to the transactions and collaboration we anticipate resulting from the framework agreement many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs decreased revenue decreased synergies and the diversion of management time and attention if we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame or at all the expected benefits may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we make investments in companies over which we do not have sole control some of these companies may operate in sectors that differ from our current operations and have different risks 

from time to time we make debt or equity investments in companies that we may not control or over which we may not have sole control for example while we have a significant equity investment in amerisourcebergen and have a designee serving on the board of directors of amerisourcebergen as of the date of this report we do not have the ability to control daytoday operations of that company although the businesses in which we have made noncontrolling investments often have a significant health and daily living or prescription drug component some of them operate in businesses that are different from our primary lines of business andor operate in different geographic markets than we do investments in these businesses among other risks subject us to the operating and financial risks of the businesses we invest in and to the risk that we do not have sole control over the operations of these businesses we rely on the internal controls and financial reporting controls of these entities and their failure to maintain effectiveness or comply with applicable standards may materially and adversely affect us investments in entities over which we do not have sole control including joint ventures and strategic alliances present additional risks such as having differing objectives from our partners or the entities in which we are invested becoming involved in disputes or competing with those persons from time to time we may make additional investments in or acquire other entities that may subject us to similar risks 

changes in economic conditions could adversely affect consumer buying practices 

our performance has been and may continue to be adversely impacted by changes in global national regional or local economic conditions and consumer confidence these conditions can also adversely affect our key vendors and customers external factors that affect consumer confidence and over which we exercise no influence include unemployment rates inflation levels of personal disposable income levels of taxes and interest and global national regional or local economic conditions as well as acts of war or terrorism changes in economic conditions and consumer confidence could adversely 

 15   

affect consumer preferences purchasing power and spending patterns which could lead to a decrease in overall consumer spending as well as in prescription drug and health services utilization and which could be exacerbated by the increasing prevalence of highdeductible health insurance plans and related plan design changes in addition reduced or flat consumer spending may drive us and our competitors to offer additional products at promotional prices all of these factors could materially and adversely impact our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

economic conditions in europe and certain emerging market countries together with austerity measures being taken by certain governments could adversely affect us 

we have significant assets and operations within europe and certain emerging market countries in our retail pharmacy international and pharmaceutical wholesale divisions an economic slowdown within any such markets could adversely affect our businesses in affected regions by reducing the prices our customers may be able or willing to pay for our products and services or by reducing the demand for our products and services either of which could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations in recent years in response to the economic environment a number of governments including the government in the united kingdom have announced or implemented austerity measures to reduce healthcare spending for the governmentsponsored healthcare systems and constrain overall government expenditures these measures which include efforts aimed at reforming healthcare coverage and reducing healthcare costs continue to exert pressure on the pricing of and reimbursement timelines for pharmaceutical drugs countries with existing austerity measures may impose additional laws regulations or requirements on the healthcare industry in addition governments that have not yet imposed austerity measures may impose them in the future any new austerity measures may be similar to or vary in scope and nature from existing austerity measures and could have a material adverse effect on our international business operations and results of operations 

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and constantly evolving new entrants to the market existing competitor actions or other changes in market dynamics could adversely impact us 

the level of competition in the retail pharmacy and pharmaceutical wholesale industries is high changes in market dynamics or actions of competitors or manufacturers including industry consolidation and the emergence of new competitors and strategic alliances could materially and adversely impact us disruptive innovation by existing or new competitors could alter the competitive landscape in the future and require us to accurately identify and assess such changes and make timely and effective changes to our strategies and business model to compete effectively our retail pharmacy businesses face intense competition from local regional national and global companies including other drugstore and pharmacy chains independent drugstores and pharmacies mailorder pharmacies and various other retailers such as grocery stores convenience stores mass merchants online and omnichannel pharmacies and retailers warehouse clubs dollar stores and other discount merchandisers some of which are aggressively expanding in markets we serve businesses in our pharmaceutical wholesale division face intense competition from direct competitors including national and regional cooperative wholesalers and alternative supply sources such as importers and manufacturers who supply directly to pharmacies competition may also come from other sources in the future as competition increases in the markets in which we operate a significant increase in general pricing pressures could occur which could require us to reevaluate our pricing structures to remain competitive for example if we are not able to anticipate and successfully respond to changes in market conditions in our pharmaceutical wholesale division including changes driven by competitors suppliers or manufacturers and increased competition from national and regional cooperative wholesalers it could result in a loss of customers or renewal of contracts or arrangements on less favorable terms 

we also could be adversely affected if we fail to identify or effectively respond to changes in market dynamics for example specialty pharmacy represents a significant and growing proportion of prescription drug spending in the united states a significant portion of which is dispensed outside of traditional retail pharmacies because our specialty pharmacy business focuses on complex and highcost medications many of which are made available by manufacturers to a limited number of pharmacies socalled limited distribution drugs that serve a relatively limited universe of patients the future growth of this business depends to a significant extent upon expanding our ability to access key drugs and successfully penetrate key treatment categories to better serve this evolving market on march 31 2017 we and prime therapeutics llc a pbm closed a transaction to form a combined central specialty pharmacy and mail services company alliancerx walgreens prime using an innovative model that seeks to align pharmacy pbm and health plans to coordinate patient care improve health outcomes and deliver cost of care opportunities if this joint venture does not successfully implement its model or is not able to compete effectively in this evolving market our business operations financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

if we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant omnichannel experience for our customers our businesses and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

 16   

our business has evolved from an instore experience to interaction with customers across numerous channels including instore online mobile and social media among others omnichannel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing customer expectations and new developments by our competitors our customers are increasingly using computers tablets mobile phones and other devices to comparison shop determine product availability and complete purchases as well as to provide immediate public reactions regarding various facets of our operations we must compete by offering a consistent and convenient shopping experience for our customers regardless of the ultimate sales channel and by investing in providing and maintaining digital tools for our customers that have the right features and are reliable and easy to use if we are unable to make improve or develop relevant customerfacing technology in a timely manner that keeps pace with technological developments and dynamic customer expectations our ability to compete and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected in addition if our online activities or our other customerfacing technology systems do not function as designed we may experience a loss of customer confidence data security breaches lost sales or be exposed to fraudulent purchases any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations reputation and results of operations 

if the merchandise and services that we offer fail to meet customer needs our sales may be adversely affected 

we could be adversely affected by changes in consumer spending levels and shopping habits and preferences including attitudes towards our retail and product brands the success of our retail pharmacy businesses depends on our ability to offer a superior shopping experience engaging customer service and a quality assortment of available merchandise that differentiates us from other retailers including enhanced health and beauty product offerings we must identify obtain supplies of and offer to our customers attractive innovative and highquality merchandise on a continuous basis our products and services must satisfy the needs and desires of our customers whose preferences may change in the future it is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand if we misjudge either the demand for products and services we sell or our customers’ purchasing habits and tastes we may be faced with excess inventories of some products and missed opportunities for products and services we chose not to offer in addition our sales may decline or we may be required to sell the merchandise we have obtained at lower prices failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences and spending patterns and evolving demographic mixes in the markets we serve could negatively affect our relationship with our customers and the demand for our products and services which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations 

our private brand offerings expose us to various additional risks 

in addition to brand name products we offer our customers private brand products that are not available from other retailers we seek to continue to grow our exclusive private brand offerings as part of our growth strategy including through the expanded offering of no7 and other brands owned or licensed on an exclusive basis as well as through selective acquisitions maintaining consistent product quality competitive pricing and availability of our private brand offerings for our customers as well as the timely development and introduction of new products is important in differentiating us from other retailers and developing and maintaining customer loyalty although we believe that our private brand products offer value to our customers and typically provide us with higher gross margins than comparable national brand products we sell the expansion of our private brand offerings also subjects us to additional risks such as potential product liability risks and mandatory or voluntary product recalls our ability to successfully protect our proprietary rights and successfully navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties our ability to successfully administer and comply with applicable contractual obligations and regulatory requirements and other risks generally encountered by entities that source sell and market exclusive branded offerings for retail an increase in sales of our private brands may also adversely affect sales of our vendors’ products which in turn could adversely affect our relationship with certain of our vendors any failure to adequately address some or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business operations results of operations and financial condition 

we may experience a significant disruption in our computer systems 

we rely extensively on our computer systems to manage our ordering pricing pointofsale pharmacy fulfillment inventory replenishment customer loyalty programs finance and other processes our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages facility damage computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches including credit card or personally identifiable information breaches vandalism natural disasters catastrophic events human error and potential cyber threats including malicious codes worms phishing attacks denial of service attacks ransomware and other sophisticated cyber attacks and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities if any of our systems are damaged fail to function properly or otherwise become unavailable we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience loss or corruption of critical data and interruptions or disruptions and delays in our ability to perform critical functions which could materially and adversely affect our businesses and results of operations in addition we are currently making and expect to continue to make substantial investments in our information technology systems and 

 17   

infrastructure some of which are significant upgrades involve replacing existing systems with successor systems making changes to existing systems or costeffectively acquiring new systems with new functionality implementing new systems carries significant potential risks including failure to operate as designed potential loss or corruption of data or information cost overruns implementation delays disruption of operations and the potential inability to meet business and reporting requirements while we are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems and believe we are taking reasonable action to mitigate known risks there can be no assurance that we will not experience significant issues with our existing systems prior to implementation that our technology initiatives will be successfully deployed as planned or that they will be timely implemented without significant disruption to our operations we also could be adversely affected by any significant disruption in the systems of third parties we interact with including key payers and vendors 

if we or the businesses we interact with do not maintain the privacy and security of sensitive customer and business information it could damage our reputation and we could suffer a loss of revenue incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation and regulatory scrutiny 

the protection of customer employee and company data is critical to our businesses cybersecurity and other information technology security risks such as a significant breach of customer employee or company data could attract a substantial amount of media attention damage our customer relationships and reputation and result in lost sales fines or lawsuits throughout our operations we receive retain and transmit certain personal information that our customers and others provide to purchase products or services fill prescriptions enroll in promotional programs participate in our customer loyalty programs register on our websites or otherwise communicate and interact with us in addition aspects of our operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks although we deploy a layered approach to address information security threats and vulnerabilities designed to protect confidential information against data security breaches a compromise of our data security systems or of those of businesses with whom we interact which results in confidential information being accessed obtained damaged or used by unauthorized or improper persons could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions and claims from customers financial institutions payment card associations and other persons any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations financial condition and results of operations because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures in addition a security breach could require that we expend substantial additional resources related to the security of information systems and disrupt our businesses 

the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding with the frequent imposition of new and changing requirements across businesses we are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing data privacy regulations in the united states and in other countries in which we operate that regulate the collection use and transfer of personal data including the transfer of personal data between or among countries some foreign data privacy regulations are more stringent than those in the united states and continue to change for example in may 2018 the general data protection regulation will supersede current european union data protection legislation impose more stringent european union data protection requirements and provide for greater penalties for noncompliance complying with these and other changing requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs and require us to change our business practices in certain jurisdictions any of which could materially adversely affect our business operations and operating results we may also face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations compliance with changes in privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes if we or those with whom we share information fail to comply with these laws and regulations or experience a data security breach our reputation could be damaged and we could be subject to additional litigation and regulatory risks our security measures may be undermined due to the actions of outside parties employee error malfeasance or otherwise and as a result an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate business and personal information any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure damage to our reputation and potentially have a material adverse effect on our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to paymentrelated risks that could increase our operating costs expose us to fraud or theft subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business operations 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including cash checks credit and debit cards gift cards and mobile payment technologies such as apple pay™ and we may offer new payment options over time acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules regulations contractual obligations and compliance requirements including payment network rules and operating guidelines data security standards and certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers these requirements and related interpretations may change over time which could make compliance more difficult or costly for certain payment methods including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which could increase over 

 18   

time and raise our operating costs we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards and other forms of electronic payment if these companies become unable to provide these services to us or if their systems are compromised it could disrupt our business the payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by persons who seek to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit any weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems if we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements or if data is compromised due to a breach or misuse of data relating to our payment systems we may be liable for costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments could be impaired in addition our reputation could suffer and our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types which could result in higher costs andor reduced sales and materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in healthcare regulatory environments may adversely affect our businesses 

political economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to significant changes that could adversely affect our results of operations in recent years the healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to reduce costs and government spending these changes include an increased reliance on managed care cuts in certain medicare and medicaid funding in the united states and the funding of governmental payers in foreign jurisdictions consolidation of competitors suppliers and other market participants and the development of large sophisticated purchasing groups we expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future some of these potential changes such as a reduction in governmental funding for certain healthcare services or adverse changes in legislation or regulations governing prescription drug pricing healthcare services or mandated benefits may cause customers to reduce the amount of our products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services we expect continued governmental and private payer pressure to reduce pharmaceutical pricing changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers’ pricing or distribution policies could also significantly reduce our profitability 

in the united states the results of the november 2016 elections have generated uncertainty with respect to and could result in significant changes in legislation regulation and government policy that could significantly impact our businesses and the health care and retail industries there have been multiple attempts to repeal amend or otherwise invalidate all or certain provisions of the aca which was enacted in 2010 to provide health insurance coverage to millions of previously uninsured americans through a combination of insurance market reforms an expansion of medicaid subsidies and health insurance mandates even if the aca remains in effect significant provisions of aca have not yet been finalized eg nondiscrimination in health programs and activities and the excise tax on highcost employersponsored health coverage and it is uncertain whether or in what form these provisions will be finalized we cannot predict whether current or future efforts to repeal amend or otherwise invalidate these laws and adopt new healthcare legislation will be successful nor can we predict the impact that such a development would have on our business and operating results future legislation or rulemaking or other regulatory actions or developments under the aca or otherwise could adversely impact the number of americans with health insurance and consequently prescription drug coverage increase regulation of pharmacy services result in changes to pharmacy reimbursement rates and otherwise change the way we do business we cannot predict the timing or impact of any future legislative rulemaking or other regulatory actions but any such actions could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

a significant change in or noncompliance with governmental regulations and other legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and profitability 

we operate in complex highly regulated environments in the united states and in the other countries in which we operate and could be adversely affected by changes to existing legal requirements including the related interpretations and enforcement practices new legal requirements andor any failure to comply with applicable regulations businesses in our pharmaceutical wholesale division are subject to a range of regulations relating to such things as product margins product traceability and the conditions under which products must be stored our retail pharmacy and health and wellness services businesses are subject to numerous country state and local regulations including licensing and other requirements for pharmacies and reimbursement arrangements the regulations to which we are subject include but are not limited to country and state registration and regulation of pharmacies and drug discount card programs dispensing and sale of controlled substances and products containing pseudoephedrine applicable governmental payer regulations including medicare and medicaid data privacy and security laws and regulations including hipaa the aca or any successor thereto laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters including those governing exposure to and the management and disposal of hazardous substances regulations regarding food and drug safety including those of the us food and drug administration “fda” and drug enforcement administration “dea” trade regulations including those of the us federal trade commission and consumer protection and safety regulations including those of the consumer product safety commission as well as state regulatory authorities governing the availability sale advertisement and promotion of products we sell as well as our loyalty and drug discount card programs antikickback laws false claims laws laws against the 

 19   

corporate practice of medicine and foreign national and state laws governing health care fraud and abuse and the practice of the profession of pharmacy for example in the united states the dea fda and various other regulatory authorities regulate the distribution and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances we are required to hold valid dea and statelevel licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with the federal and various state controlled substance acts and related regulations governing the sale dispensing disposal holding and distribution of controlled substances the dea fda and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations we are also governed by foreign national and state laws of general applicability including laws regulating matters of working conditions health and safety and equal employment opportunity and other labor and employment matters as well as employee benefit competition and antitrust matters in addition we could have significant exposure if we are found to have infringed another party’s intellectual property rights 

changes in laws regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may alter the landscape in which we do business and may significantly affect our cost of doing business the impact of new laws regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices generally cannot be predicted and changes in applicable laws regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may require extensive system and operational changes be difficult to implement increase our operating costs and require significant capital expenditures untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties that could adversely affect the continued operation of our businesses including suspension of payments from government programs loss of required government certifications loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government programs including the medicare and medicaid programs in the united states and the national health service in the united kingdom loss of licenses and significant fines or monetary penalties any failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements in the united states or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in significant legal and financial exposure damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

we could be adversely affected by product liability product recall personal injury or other health and safety issues 

we could be adversely impacted by the supply of defective or expired products including the infiltration of counterfeit products into the supply chain errors in relabelling of products product tampering product recall and contamination or product mishandling issues through our pharmacies and specialist packaging sites we are also exposed to risks relating to the services we provide errors in the dispensing and packaging of pharmaceuticals including related counseling and in the provision of other healthcare services could lead to serious injury or death product liability or personal injury claims may be asserted against us with respect to any of the products or pharmaceuticals we sell or services we provide our healthcare clinics also increase our exposure to professional liability claims related to medical care should a product or other liability issue arise the coverage limits under our insurance programs and the indemnification amounts available to us may not be adequate to protect us against claims and judgments we also may not be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms in the future we could suffer significant reputational damage and financial liability if we or any affiliated entities experience any of the foregoing health and safety issues or incidents which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

we have significant outstanding debt our debt and associated payment obligations could significantly increase in the future if we incur additional debt and do not retire existing debt 

we have outstanding debt and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity as of august 31 2017 we had approximately 13 billion  of outstanding indebtedness including shortterm borrowings our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including 

 

 

 

 

 20   

 

we may incur or assume significantly more debt in the future including in connection with acquisitions strategic investments or joint ventures if we add new debt and do not retire existing debt the risks described above could increase we also could be adversely impacted by any failure to renew or replace on terms acceptable to us or at all existing funding arrangements when they expire and any failure to satisfy applicable covenants 

our longterm debt obligations include covenants that may adversely affect our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur certain secured indebtedness or engage in certain types of transactions in addition our existing credit agreements require us to maintain as of the last day of each fiscal quarter a ratio of consolidated debt to total capitalization not to exceed a certain level our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants may be affected by events beyond our control if we breach any of these restrictions or covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable this could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition 

we could be adversely affected by downgrades to our credit ratings or disruptions in our ability to access wellfunctioning capital markets 

historically we have relied on the public debt capital markets to fund portions of our capital investments and access to the commercial paper market and bank credit facilities as part of our working capital management strategy our continued access to these markets and the terms of such access depend on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets our operating performance and our credit ratings the major credit rating agencies have assigned us and our corporate debt investment grade credit ratings these ratings are based on a number of factors which include their assessment of our financial strength and financial policies we benefit from investment grade ratings as they serve to lower our borrowing costs and facilitate our access to a variety of lenders and other creditors including landlords for our leased stores on terms that we consider advantageous to our businesses however there can be no assurance that any particular rating assigned to us will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency if in that rating agency’s judgment future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating so warrant incurrence of additional debt by us could adversely affect our credit ratings we depend on banks and other financial institutions to provide credit to our business and perform under our agreements with them defaults by one or more of these counterparties on their obligations to us could materially and adversely affect us any disruptions or turmoil in the capital markets or any downgrade of our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets and increase the cost of and counterparty risks associated with existing facilities which could materially and adversely affect our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

we may be unable to keep existing store locations or open new locations in desirable places on favorable terms which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores local land use and zoning regulations environmental regulations and other regulatory requirements may impact our ability to find suitable locations and influence the cost of constructing renovating and operating our stores in addition real estate zoning construction and other delays may adversely affect store openings and renovations and increase our costs further changing local demographics at existing store locations may adversely affect revenue and profitability levels at those stores the termination or expiration of leases at existing store locations may adversely affect us if the renewal terms of those leases are unacceptable to us and we are forced to close or relocate stores if we determine to close or relocate a store subject to a lease we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for the balance of the lease term if we are unable to maintain our existing store locations or open new locations in desirable places and on favorable terms our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

as a holding company walgreens boots alliance is dependent on funding from its operating subsidiaries to pay dividends and other obligations 

walgreens boots alliance is a holding company with no business operations of its own its assets primarily consist of direct and indirect ownership interests in and its business is conducted through subsidiaries which are separate legal entities as a result it is dependent on funding from its subsidiaries including walgreens and alliance boots to meet its obligations additionally walgreens boots alliance’s subsidiaries may be restricted in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions to walgreens boots alliance which may limit the payment of cash dividends or other distributions to the holders of walgreens boots alliance common stock credit facilities and other debt obligations of walgreens boots alliance as well as statutory provisions may further limit the ability of walgreens boots alliance and its subsidiaries to pay dividends payments to walgreens boots alliance by its subsidiaries are also contingent upon its subsidiaries’ earnings and business considerations 

 21   

our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly 

our operating results have historically varied on a quarterly basis and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future factors that may affect our quarterly operating results some of which are beyond the control of management include but are not limited to the timing of the introduction of new generic and brand name prescription drugs inflation including with respect to generic drug procurement costs the timing and severity of the cough cold and flu season changes in payer reimbursement rates and terms fluctuations in inventory energy transportation labor healthcare and other costs significant acquisitions dispositions joint ventures and other strategic initiatives asset impairment charges the relative magnitude of our lifo provision in any particular quarter foreign currency fluctuations seasonality prolonged severe weather in key markets and many of the other risk factors discussed herein accordingly we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and investors should not rely on the results of any particular quarter as an indication of our future performance 

our businesses are seasonal in nature and adverse events during the holiday and cough cold and flu seasons could adversely impact our operating results 

our businesses are seasonal in nature with the second fiscal quarter december january and february typically generating a higher proportion of retail sales and earnings than other fiscal quarters we purchase significant amounts of seasonal inventory in anticipation of the holiday season adverse events such as deteriorating economic conditions higher unemployment higher gas prices public transportation disruptions or unanticipated adverse weather could result in lowerthanplanned sales during key selling seasons for example frequent or unusually heavy snowfall ice storms rainstorms windstorms or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period could make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and increase our snow removal and other costs this could lead to lower sales or to unanticipated markdowns negatively impacting our financial condition and results of operations in addition both prescription and nonprescription drug sales are affected by the timing and severity of the cough cold and flu season which can vary considerably from year to year 

we could be adversely impacted by changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters 

generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our businesses including but not limited to revenue recognition asset impairment impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets inventories equity method investments vendor rebates and other vendor consideration lease obligations selfinsurance liabilities pension and postretirement benefits tax matters unclaimed property laws and litigation and other contingent liabilities are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition for example changes in accounting standards and the application of existing accounting standards particularly related to the measurement of fair value as compared to carrying value for the company’s reporting units including goodwill intangible assets and investments in equity interests including investments held by our equity method investees may have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include significant adverse changes in the business climate and declines in the financial condition of a reporting unit factors that could lead to impairment of investments in equity interests of the companies in which we invested or the investments held by those companies include a prolonged period of decline in their operating performance or adverse changes in the economic regulatory and legal environments of the countries in which they operate in 

new accounting guidance also may require systems and other changes that could increase our operating costs andor significantly change our financial statements for example in february 2016 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu” 201602 leases topic 842 which supersedes topic 840 leases this asu which is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2018 fiscal 2020 seeks to increase the transparency and comparability of organizations by recognizing operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements see “new accounting pronouncements” within note 2 summary of major accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements implementing this asu as well as other new accounting guidance may require us to make significant upgrades to and investments in our lease administration systems and other accounting systems and could result in significant adverse changes to our financial statements 

we have a substantial amount of goodwill and other intangible assets which could in the future become impaired and result in material noncash charges to our results of operations 

 22

we are exposed to risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings 

we operate in a highly regulated and litigious environment we are involved in litigation arbitration and other legal proceedings and subject to investigations inspections audits inquiries and similar actions by governmental authorities arising in the course of our businesses including those contained in note 11 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this form 10k legal proceedings in general and securities and class action litigation in particular can be expensive and disruptive some of these suits may purport or may be determined to be class actions andor involve parties seeking large andor indeterminate amounts including punitive or exemplary damages and may remain unresolved for several years in addition under the  qui tam  or “whistleblower” provisions of the federal and various state false claims acts persons may bring lawsuits alleging that a violation of the federal antikickback statute or similar laws has resulted in the submission of “false” claims to federal andor state healthcare programs including medicare and medicaid from time to time we are also involved in legal proceedings as a plaintiff involving antitrust tax contract intellectual property and other matters we cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies and the costs incurred in litigation can be substantial regardless of the outcome substantial unanticipated verdicts fines and rulings do sometimes occur as a result we could from time to time incur judgments enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters and such developments could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued andor our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid the outcome of some of these legal proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could negatively affect our operations additionally defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management’s attention and resources 

we could be adversely affected by violations of antibribery anticorruption andor international trade laws 

we are subject to laws concerning our business operations and marketing activities in foreign countries where we conduct business for example we are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” us export control antimoney laundering and trade sanction laws and similar anticorruption and international trade laws in certain foreign countries such as the uk bribery act any violation of which could create substantial liability for us and also harm our reputation the fcpa generally prohibits us companies and their officers directors employees and intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment the fcpa also requires that us public companies maintain books and records that fairly and accurately reflect transactions and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls if we are found to have violated the fcpa or any other antibribery anticorruption or international trade laws we may face sanctions including civil and criminal fines disgorgement of profits and suspension or debarment of our ability to contract with governmental agencies or receive export licenses in addition new initiatives may be proposed from time to time that impact the trading conditions in certain countries or regions and may include retaliatory duties or trade sanctions which if enacted could adversely impact our trading relationships with vendors or other parties in such locations and have a material adverse effect on our operations from time to time we may face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign governmental agencies relating to our international business activities compliance with which could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations an adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could damage our reputation and subject us to fines or other penalties which could materially and adversely affect our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

we could be subject to adverse changes in tax laws regulations and interpretations or challenges to our tax positions 

we are a large corporation with operations in the united states and numerous other jurisdictions around the world as such we are subject to tax laws and regulations of the united states federal state and local governments as well as various foreign jurisdictions we compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate as the 

 23   

tax rates vary among jurisdictions a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision any changes in corporate income tax laws or any implementation of tax laws relating to corporate tax reform could significantly impact our overall tax liability from time to time legislative and regulatory initiatives are proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions effective tax rate tax payments or financial condition in addition tax laws and regulations are complex and subject to varying interpretations and any significant failure to comply with applicable tax laws and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions could give rise to substantial penalties and liabilities any change in enacted tax laws rules or regulatory or judicial interpretations any adverse outcome in connection with tax audits in any jurisdiction or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate tax payments and results of operations 

our insurance strategies may expose us to unexpected costs 

we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance to provide for potential liability for workers’ compensation automobile and general liability property director and officers’ liability and employee healthcare benefits provisions for losses related to selfinsured risks generally are based upon actuarially determined estimates any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability substantial unanticipated losses or liabilities including those due to natural disasters or otherwise as well as changes in legal claims trends and interpretations variability in inflation rates changes in the nature and method of claims settlement benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws insolvency of insurance carriers and changes in discount rates could all materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we could be adversely impacted by changes in assumptions used in calculating pension assets and liabilities 

we operate certain defined benefit pension plans in the united kingdom which were closed to new entrants in 2010 as well as smaller plans in other jurisdictions the valuation of the pension plan’s assets and liabilities depends in part on assumptions which are primarily based on the financial markets as well as longevity and employee retention rates this valuation is particularly sensitive to material changes in the value of equity bond and other investments held by the pension plans changes in the corporate bond yields which are used in the measurement of the liabilities changes in market expectations for longterm price inflation and new evidence on projected longevity rates funding requirements and the impact on the statement of earnings relating to these pension plans are also influenced by these factors adverse changes in the assumptions used to calculate the value of pension assets and liabilities including lower than expected pension fund investment returns andor increased life expectancy of plan participants or regulatory change could require us to increase the funding of its defined benefit pension plans or incur higher expenses which would adversely impact our results of operations and financial position 

certain stockholders may have significant voting influence over matters requiring stockholder approval 

as of august 31 2017 affiliates of stefano pessina our executive vice chairman and chief executive officer the “sp investors” had sole or shared voting power directly or indirectly over an aggregate of approximately 14 of our outstanding common stock the sp investors have agreed to for so long as they have the right to designate a nominee for election to the board to vote all of their shares of common stock in accordance with the board’s recommendation on matters submitted to a vote of the company’s stockholders including with respect to the election of directors the sp investors’ significant interest in our common stock potentially could determine the outcome of matters submitted to a vote by our stockholders the influence of the sp investors could result in the company taking actions that other stockholders do not support or failing to take actions that other stockholders support as a result the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected 

shares issued to former alliance boots stockholders in connection with our strategic combination with alliance boots are eligible for future sale 

the shares issued to the sp investors and certain other former alliance boots stockholders in connection with our strategic combination with alliance boots generally may now be sold pursuant to rule 144 under the securities act of 1933 as amended the “securities act” subject to restrictions in the case of shares held by persons deemed to be our affiliates and to certain obligations pursuant to a shareholders agreement as amended the “company shareholders agreement” with certain of the sp investors in addition the company shareholders agreement also contains registration rights that would obligate us in certain instances to file future registration statements under the securities act covering resales of shares issued to former alliance boots stockholders or to permit a “piggyback” on a future registration statement a sale or the perception that a sale may occur of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could adversely impact the market price of our common stock 

conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest may arise because certain of our directors and officers are also owners or directors of companies we may have dealings with 

 24   

conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest could arise between our interests and the interests of the other entities and business activities in which our directors or officers are involved for example potential conflicts of interest could arise if a dispute were to arise between the company and other parties to the company shareholders agreement including the sp investors mr pessina our executive vice chairman and chief executive officer indirectly controls alliance santé participations sa “asp” a privatelyheld company which is a party to the company shareholders agreement and he and his partner ornella barra our cochief operating officer serve as directors of asp similar issues could arise in connection with other transactions in the future while our contractual arrangements place restrictions on the parties’ conduct in certain situations and related party transactions are subject to independent review and approval in accordance with our related party transaction approval procedures and applicable law the potential for a conflict of interest exists and such persons may have conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting both companies 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws delaware law andor our agreements with certain stockholders may impede the ability of our stockholders to make changes to our board or impede a takeover 

certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as provisions of the delaware general corporation law the “dgcl” could make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the board or discourage delay or prevent a merger consolidation or acquisitions that stockholders may otherwise consider favorable these provisions include the authorization of the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that could be issued by the board limitations on the ability of stockholders to call special meetings and advance notice requirements for nomination for election to the board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings we are also subject to the provisions of section 203 of the dgcl which prohibits us except under specified circumstances from engaging in any mergers significant sales of stock or assets or business combinations with any stockholder or group of stockholders who own 15 or more of our common stock 

under the company shareholders agreement the sp investors are entitled to designate one nominee to the board currently stefano pessina for so long as the sp investors continue to meet certain beneficial ownership thresholds and subject to certain other conditions pursuant to the company shareholders agreement the sp investors have agreed that for so long as they have the right to designate a nominee to the board they will vote all of their shares of common stock in accordance with the board’s recommendation on matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders including with respect to the election of directors 

while these provisions do not make us immune from takeovers or changes in the composition of the board and are intended to protect our stockholders from among other things coercive or otherwise unfair tactics these provisions could have the effect of making it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the board or discouraging delaying or preventing a merger consolidation or acquisitions that stockholders may otherwise consider favorable see also the risk factor captioned “certain stockholders may have significant voting influence over matters requiring stockholder approval” above

comparability 

as a result of the completion of the second step transaction on december 31 2014 there are a number of items that affect comparability of reported results prior to december 31 2014 our operations were within one reportable segment that included the results of the retail pharmacy usa division and corporate costs along with the fully consolidated results of walgreens boots alliance development gmbh “wbad” a global sourcing enterprise formed by walgreens and alliance boots and equity earnings from alliance boots following the completion of the reorganization and the second step transaction on december 31 2014 we report results in three segments segmental reporting includes the allocation of procurement benefits including wbad’s results and the combined corporate costs for periods subsequent to december 31 2014 we have determined that it is impracticable to allocate historical results to the current segmental presentation accordingly our retail pharmacy usa segment results for fiscal 2015 for months prior to december 31 2014 include all corporate costs of walgreens the full consolidated results of wbad and equity income from walgreens’ premerger 45 interest in alliance boots 

the completion of the second step transaction on december 31 2014 also means that results for the twelve month periods ended august 31   2017  and 2016  include the results of alliance boots on a fully consolidated basis while the twelve month period ended august 31 2015 includes the results of alliance boots for eight months january through august 2015 on a fully consolidated basis and as equity income from walgreens’ premerger 45 interest in alliance boots for four months september through december 2014

walgreens boots alliance results of operations 

fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016   

fiscal 2017  net earnings attributable to walgreens boots alliance decrease d 23  percent to 41 billion  while diluted net earnings per share decrease d 10  percent to 378  compared with the prior year the decreases reflect rite aid related costs the phasing of the company’s cost transformation program and the impact in the prior year of the change in accounting method for our investment in amerisourcebergen largely offset by the reduction in the fair value of the company’s amerisourcebergen warrants improvements in selling general and administration expenses before cost transformation expenses and a lower effective tax rate 

other expense for fiscal 2017  and fiscal 2016  was 11 million  and 261 million  respectively in fiscal 2016  the change in fair value of our amerisourcebergen warrants resulted in a loss of 517 million and additionally we recognized income of 268 million related to the change in accounting method for our investment in amerisourcebergen 

  

interest was a net expense of 693 million  and 596 million  in fiscal 2017  and 2016  respectively the increase mainly reflects the prefunded acquisition financing costs relating to the rite aid transaction 

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2017  and 2016  was 157  and 194  respectively the net decrease  in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to changes in the geographic mix of our pretax earnings favorable changes in permanent differences between our financial statement earnings and taxable profits as well as incremental discrete tax benefits our mix of pretax earnings was notably impacted by our cost transformation program and costs associated with the termination of the rite aid merger agreement both of which reduced our us pretax earnings for fiscal 2017 net discrete tax benefits resulted primarily from deferred tax benefits related to a change in the uk tax rate adopting asu 201609 and net tax benefits associated with prior tax years 

adjusted diluted net earnings per share nongaap measure fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016   

adjusted net earnings attributable to walgreens boots alliance in fiscal 2017   increase d 99  percent to 55 billion  compared with the prior year adjusted diluted net earnings per share in fiscal 2017   increase d 111  percent to 510  compared with the prior year adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share were negatively  impacted by 17  percentage points and 18  percentage points respectively as a result of currency translation 

excluding the impact of currency translation the increase in adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted net earnings per share for fiscal 2017  was primarily due to an increase in equity earnings from amerisourcebergen and a lower effective tax rate see “nongaap measures” below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measure 

 37   

fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015   

fiscal 2016 net earnings attributable to walgreens boots alliance decreased 11 percent to 42 billion while diluted net earnings per share decreased 45 percent to 382 compared with the prior year the decreases reflect fluctuations in the fair value adjustments of the company’s amerisourcebergen warrants and the prior year gain on the previously held equity interest in alliance boots which was largely offset by the inclusion of alliance boots consolidated results for the entire period and an increase in operating income at retail pharmacy usa 

other income expense for fiscal 2016 was an expense of 261 million as compared to income of 685 million in fiscal 2015 the change in fair value of our amerisourcebergen warrants excluding deferred income amortization resulted in a loss of 546 million for fiscal 2016 as compared to income of 759 million for fiscal 2015 additionally we recognized income of 268 million for fiscal 2016 related to the change in accounting method for our investment in amerisourcebergen 

  

interest was a net expense of 596 million and 605 million in fiscal 2016 and 2015 respectively fiscal 2016 included interest expense on notes issued during june 2016 fiscal 2015 included interest expense of 99 million related to the repayment of a portion of our longterm debt in advance of its maturity 

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 and 2015 was 194 and 199 respectively the net decrease in the effective tax rate is attributable to several factors first our fiscal 2016 effective tax rate benefited from having a fullyear of foreign sourced pretax earnings taxed at lower rates as compared to fiscal 2015 when the company had only eight months of those earnings after the second step transaction further in fiscal 2016 our domestic pretax earnings were reduced as a result of the amerisourcebergen warrants then held by the company in addition during fiscal 2016 the company benefited from enacted tax law changes tax rate reductions in multiple foreign tax jurisdictions most notably the united kingdom which generated a 178 million tax benefit the company also had fewer nondeductible expenses in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 these items were partly offset by the facts that in fiscal 2015 the company had a nontaxable gain on its previously held equity investment in alliance boots and recognized the benefit of a capital loss deferred tax asset neither of which recurred in fiscal 2016 

adjusted diluted net earnings per share nongaap measure fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015   

adjusted net earnings attributable to walgreens boots alliance in fiscal 2016 increased 226 percent to 50 billion compared with the prior year adjusted diluted net earnings per share in the fiscal year increased 183 percent to 459 compared with the prior year the increase in adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted net earnings per share for fiscal 2016 was primarily attributable to inclusion of alliance boots consolidated results for the entire period and an increase in operating income at retail pharmacy usa see “nongaap measures” below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measure

critical accounting policies 

the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and include amounts based on management’s prudent judgments and estimates actual results may differ from these estimates management believes that any reasonable deviation from those judgments and estimates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations to the extent that the estimates used differ from actual results however adjustments to the statement of earnings and corresponding balance sheet accounts would be necessary these adjustments would be made in future periods some of the more significant estimates include business combinations goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment cost of sales and inventory equity method investments pension and postretirement benefits and income taxes we use the following methods to determine our estimates 

  

business combinations   –  we account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that once control is obtained all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition the determination of fair values of assets and liabilities acquired requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available 

for intangible assets we generally use the income approach to determine fair value the income approach requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions primarily include but are not limited to discount rates terminal growth rates royalty rates forecasts of revenue operating income depreciation amortization and capital expenditures the discount rates applied to the projections reflect the risk factors associated with those projections 

although we believe our estimates of fair value are reasonable actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on the determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired 

judgment is also required in determining the intangible asset’s useful life 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment  – goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value as part of our impairment analysis for each reporting unit we determine fair value for each reporting unit this determination includes estimating the fair value using both the income and market approaches the income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit including projected future operating results economic projections anticipated future cash flows and discount rates the market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping 

 51   

the determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions primarily include but are not limited to the selection of appropriate peer group companies control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we compete discount rates terminal growth rates forecasts of revenue operating income depreciation amortization and capital expenditures although we believe our estimates of fair value are reasonable actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units the amount of any goodwill impairment charge or both 

we also compared the sum of the estimated fair values of the reporting units to the company’s fair value as implied by the market value of the company’s equity and debt securities this comparison indicated that in total our assumptions and estimates were reasonable however future declines in the overall market value of the company’s equity securities may indicate that the fair value of one or more reporting units has declined below its carrying value 

our reporting units’ fair values exceeded their carrying amounts ranging from approximately 9  to more than 400  due to the negative impact of reductions in pharmacy funding in the united kingdom the fair value of our boots reporting unit within our retail pharmacy international division was impacted and is in excess of its carrying value by approximately 9 the goodwill of the boots reporting unit is not currently impaired and we will continue to monitor the uk industry trends and the impact it may have on the business see note 7 goodwill and other intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

  

indefinitelived intangible assets are tested by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 

our indefinitelived intangible asset fair value is estimated using the relief from royalty method and excess earnings method of the income approach these estimates can be affected by a number of factors including but not limited to general economic conditions availability of market information as well as our profitability 

cost of sales and inventory  – cost of sales includes the purchase price of goods and services sold store and warehouse inventory loss inventory obsolescence manufacturing costs certain direct product design and development costs and supplier rebates in addition to product costs cost of sales includes manufacturing costs warehousing costs for retail operations purchasing costs freight costs cash discounts and vendor allowances cost of sales for our retail pharmacy usa segment is derived based upon pointofsale scanning information with an estimate for shrinkage and is adjusted based on periodic inventory counts inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market determined by the lastin firstout “lifo” method for the retail pharmacy usa segment and primarily on a firstin firstout “fifo” basis for inventory in the retail pharmacy international and pharmaceutical wholesale segments 

  

equity method investments     – we use the equity method to account for investments in companies if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence but not control over operating and financial policies of the investee our proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies is included in consolidated net earnings judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as our ownership interest representation on the board of directors participation in policymaking decisions and material purchase and sale transactions 

we evaluate equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable factors considered when reviewing an equity method investment for impairment include the length of time duration and the extent severity to which the fair value of the equity method investment has been less than cost the investee’s financial condition and nearterm prospects and the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery an impairment that is otherthantemporary is recognized in the period identified 

  

pension and postretirement benefits  – we have various defined benefit pension plans that cover some of our foreign employees we also have postretirement healthcare plans that cover qualifying domestic employees eligibility and the level of benefits for these plans varies depending on participants’ status date of hire and or length of service our pension and postretirement expenses and valuations are dependent on assumptions used by our actuaries in calculating those amounts these assumptions include discount rates healthcare cost trends longterm rate of return on plan assets retirement rates mortality rates and other factors in determining our longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption we consider both the historical performance of the investment portfolio as well as the longterm market return expectations based on the investment mix of the portfolio a change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on our projected benefit obligation and pension expense a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in a decline of 389 million to our pension benefit 

 52   

obligation a 25 basis point decrease on the expected return on plan assets assumption would increase our pension expense by 22 million 

our policy is to fund our pension plans in accordance with applicable regulations our postretirement healthcare plans are not funded 

  

income taxes  – we are subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business us federal state local and foreign tax authorities raise questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions in evaluating the tax benefits associated with our various tax filing positions we record a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized adjustments are made to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which we determine the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities the statute of limitations expires for the return containing the tax position or when more information becomes available our liability for unrecognized tax benefits including accrued penalties and interest is primarily included in other longterm liabilities and current income taxes on our consolidated balance sheets and in income tax provision in our consolidated statements of earnings 

  

in determining our provision for income taxes we use income permanent differences between book and tax income and enacted statutory income tax rates the provision for income taxes rate also reflects our assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits in addition to any foreignbased income deemed to be taxable in the united states discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur

offbalance sheet arrangements

the company currently estimates that it will recognize cumulative pretax charges to its gaap financial results of approximately 450 million including costs associated with lease obligations and other real estate costs employee severance and other exit costs the company expects to incur pretax charges of approximately 270 million for lease obligations and other real estate costs and approximately 180 million for employee severance and other exit costs the company estimates that substantially all of these cumulative pretax charges will result in future cash expenditures 

as the store optimization program is implemented charges will be recognized as the costs are incurred over time in accordance with gaap the company intends to treat charges related to the store optimization program as special items impacting comparability of results in its quarterly earnings disclosures

the amounts and timing of all estimates are subject to change until finalized the actual amounts and timing may vary materially based on various factors see “cautionary note regarding forwardlooking statements” above because this report is being filed within four business days from the date of the reportable event we have made the foregoing disclosure in this report instead of in a form 8k under item 205 costs associated with exit or disposal activities

industry overview 

the retail pharmacy and pharmaceutical wholesale industries across the globe are highly competitive and have been experiencing consolidation in recent years prescription drugs play a significant role in healthcare and constitute a first line of treatment for many medical conditions we believe the longterm outlook for prescription drug utilization is strong due in part to aging populations increases in life expectancy increases in the availability and utilization of generic drugs the continued development of innovative drugs that improve quality of life and control healthcare costs and increases in the number of persons with insurance coverage for prescription drugs including in the united states the expansion of healthcare insurance coverage under the patient protection and affordable care act the “aca” and “baby boomers” increasingly becoming eligible for the federally funded medicare part d prescription program pharmaceutical wholesalers act as a vital link between drug manufacturers and pharmacies and healthcare providers in supplying pharmaceuticals to patients 

 

 2  

the retail pharmacy industry across the globe relies significantly on private and governmental third party payers many private organizations throughout the healthcare industry including pharmacy benefit management “pbm” companies and health insurance companies have consolidated in recent years to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater bargaining power third party payers including the medicare part d plans and the statesponsored medicaid and related managed care medicaid agencies in the united states can change eligibility requirements or reduce certain reimbursement rates in addition in many european countries the government provides or subsidizes healthcare to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices patient eligibility and reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored healthcare system changes in law or regulation also can impact reimbursement rates and terms for example the aca seeks to reduce federal spending by altering the medicaid reimbursement formula “amp” for multisource drugs in the united states and the uk department of health plans to implement funding cuts to reduce costs within the national health service by reducing drug reimbursement rates these changes generally are expected to reduce medicaid reimbursements in the united states and pharmacy reimbursements in the uk  state medicaid programs are also expected to continue to seek reductions in reimbursements independent of amp when third party payers or governmental authorities take actions that restrict eligibility or reduce prices or reimbursement rates sales and margins in the retail pharmacy industry could be reduced which would adversely affect industry profitability in some cases these possible adverse effects may be partially or entirely offset by controlling inventory costs and other expenses dispensing more higher margin generics finding new revenue streams through pharmacy services or other offerings andor dispensing a greater volume of prescriptions

generic prescription drugs have continued to help lower overall costs for customers and third party payers we expect the utilization of generic pharmaceuticals to continue to increase in general in the united states generic versions of drugs generate lower sales dollars per prescription but higher gross profit dollars as compared with patentprotected brand name drugs the positive impact on retail pharmacy gross profit dollars can be significant in the first several months after a generic version of a drug is first allowed to compete with the branded version which is generally referred to as a “generic conversion” in any given year the number of major brand name drugs that undergo a conversion from branded to generic status can vary and the timing of generic conversions can be difficult to predict which can have a significant impact on retail pharmacy sales and gross profit dollars 

we expect that market demand government regulation thirdparty reimbursement policies government contracting requirements and other pressures will continue to cause the industries in which we compete to evolve pharmacists are on the frontlines of the healthcare delivery system and we believe rising healthcare costs and the limited supply of primary care physicians present new opportunities for pharmacists and retail pharmacies to play an even greater role in driving positive outcomes for patients and payers through expanded service offerings such as immunizations and other preventive care healthcare clinics pharmacistled medication therapy management and chronic condition management

segments 

our operations are organized into three divisions which are also our reportable segments 

 

 

 

 

 

for fiscal 2016 our segment sales were retail pharmacy usa 838 billion retail pharmacy international 133 billion and pharmaceutical wholesale 226 billion additional information relating to our segments is included in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii item 7 below and in note 18 segment reporting to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 below which information is incorporated herein by reference

retail pharmacy usa

our retail pharmacy usa division excluding equity method investments has pharmacyled health and beauty retail offerings in 50 states the district of columbia puerto rico and the us virgin islands each focused on helping people feel happy and healthy we operated 8175 retail stores in the division as of august 31 2016 our principal retail pharmacy brands in the division are walgreens and duane reade we are a market leader in the united states and as of august 31 2016 approximately 76 of the population of the united states lived within five miles of a walgreens or duane reade retail pharmacy

we provide customers with convenient omnichannel access to consumer goods and services including own branded general merchandise such as nice delish tm and well at walgreens as well as pharmacy and health and wellness services in communities across america our walgreens com website receives an average of 58 million visits per month integrated with our ecommerce platform the walgreens mobile application allows customers to refill prescriptions through scan technology receive text messages alerting when a refill is due and other retail functionality such as photo and shopping features

 

 3  

our services help improve health outcomes for patients and manage costs for payers including employers managed care organizations health systems pbm companies and the public sector we utilize our retail network as a channel to provide health and wellness services to our customers and patients as illustrated by our ability to play a significant role in providing flu vaccines and other immunizations we also provide specialty pharmacy services  as of august 31 2016 we had approximately 400 instore clinic locations throughout the united states some of which are operated by the company and some of which are operated by health system partners we have more than 76000 healthcare service providers including pharmacists pharmacy technicians nurse practitioners and other health related professionals

the components of the division’s sales are pharmacy the sale of prescription drugs and provision of pharmacyrelated services and retail the sale of healthcare and retail products including nonprescription drugs beauty toiletries and general merchandise the division’s sales are subject to the influence of seasonality particularly the winter holiday and cough cold and flu seasons this seasonality also can affect the division’s proportion of sales between retail and pharmacy during certain periods the components of the division’s fiscal year sales were as follows

 

we filled 7401 million prescriptions including immunizations in the division in fiscal 2016 adjusted to 30day equivalents prescriptions filled were 9285 million in fiscal 2016 sales where reimbursement is received from managed care organizations governmental agencies pbm companies and private insurance were approximately 97 of the division’s fiscal 2016 pharmacy sales

we fill prescriptions for many state medicaid public assistance programs sales from all such medicaid plans were approximately 4  of the division’s fiscal 2016 sales  sales from medicare part d plans were approximately 17  of the division’s fiscal 2016 sales 

our us loyalty program balance® rewards is designed to reward our most valuable customers and encourage shopping in stores and online balance® rewards members receive special pricing on select products and earn everyday rewards points for purchasing most merchandise that can be instantly redeemed at our stores or through walgreenscom as of august 31 2016 the number of active balance® rewards members totaled 874 million for this purpose we define an active member as someone who has used their card in the last six months

amerisourcebergen supplies and distributes a significant amount of generic and branded pharmaceutical products to the division’s pharmacies we purchase our nonpharmaceutical merchandise from numerous manufacturers and wholesalers

our sales and gross profit are impacted by among other things both the percentage of prescriptions that we fill that are generic and the rate at which new generic drugs are introduced to the market because any number of factors outside of our control can affect timing for a generic conversion we face substantial uncertainty in predicting when such conversions will occur and what effect they will have on particular future periods

the current environment of our   pharmacy business also includes ongoing reimbursement pressure and a shift in pharmacy mix towards 90day at retail one prescription that is the equivalent of three 30day prescriptions  and medicare part d prescriptions further consolidation among generic manufacturers coupled with changes in the number of major brand name drugs anticipated to undergo a conversion from branded to generic status may also result in gross margin pressures within the industry

we continuously face reimbursement pressure from pbm companies health maintenance organizations managed care organizations and other commercial third party payers our agreements with these payers are regularly subject to expiration termination or renegotiation in addition plan changes with rate adjustments often occur in january and our reimbursement arrangements may provide for rate adjustments at prescribed intervals during their term we experienced lower reimbursement rates in fiscal 2016 as compared to the same period in the prior year further we accepted lower medicare part d reimbursement rates for calendar 2016 compared to calendar 2015 in order to secure preferred relationships with medicare part d plans serving senior patients with significant pharmacy needswe expect this trend to continue 

 

 4  

we also have worked to develop and expand our relationships with commercial third party payers to enable new andor improved market access via participation in pharmacy provider networks they offer the prescription volume impact of new agreements and relationships typically is incremental over time in fiscal 2017 we anticipate prescription growth to be relatively stronger in the second half of the fiscal year reflecting the timing and development of these strategic relationships  

our 90day at retail prescription drug offering is typically at a lower margin than comparable 30day prescriptions but provides us with the opportunity to increase business with patients with chronic prescription needs while offering increased convenience helping facilitate improved prescription adherence and resulting in a lower cost to fill the 90day prescription 

retail pharmacy international

our retail pharmacy international division excluding equity method investments has pharmacyled health and beauty retail businesses in eight countries each focused on helping people look and feel their best we operated 4673 retail stores in the division as of august 31 2016 see “properties” in part i item 2 below for information regarding geographic coverage and have grown our online presence significantly in recent years our principal retail pharmacy brands are boots in the united kingdom thailand norway the republic of ireland and the netherlands benavides in mexico and ahumada in chile in europe we are a market leader and our retail stores are conveniently located and our pharmacists are well placed to provide a significant role in the provision of healthcare services working closely with other primary healthcare providers in the communities we serve

the boots omnichannel offering is differentiated from that of competitors due to the product brands we own such as no7 boots pharmaceuticals botanics liz earle soap  glory and ‘only at boots’ exclusive products together with our long established reputation for trust and customer care our brands portfolio is enhanced by our inhouse product research and development and manufacturing capabilities

our retail store networks are typically complemented by online platforms in the united kingdom our transactional website bootscom receives on average approximately 20 million visits monthly through the bootscom website and integrated mobile application our ‘order and collect’ service allows customers to order from a range of over 35000 products by 800 pm and collect from noon the following day from approximately 95  of the united kingdom’s retail stores as of august 31 2016

the boots advantage card loyalty program where customers earn points on purchases for redemption at a later date continues to be a key element of the boots offering as of august 31 2016 the number of active boots advantage card members totaled 155 million for this purpose we define an active member as someone who has used their card in the last six months

in addition boots in the united kingdom is one of the leaders in the optical market with 636 practices of which 182 operated on a franchise basis as of august 31 2016 approximately 30 of these optical practices are located in boots stores with the balance being standalone optical practices

the components of the division’s sales are pharmacy typically the sale of prescription drugs and provision of pharmacyrelated services subject to variation in particular jurisdictions depending upon regulatory and other factors and retail primarily the sale of health and beauty products including beauty toiletries and lifestyle merchandising nonprescription drugs and in the united kingdom the provision of optical services

the division’s sales are subject to the influence of seasonality with the second fiscal quarter typically the strongest as a result of the winter holiday period this seasonality affects the division’s proportion of sales between retail and pharmacy during certain periods the components of the division’s fiscal year sales were as follows

 

 

 

 5  

the division’s retail sales gross profit margin and gross profit dollars are impacted by among other things the highly competitive nature of the health and beauty category specifically our and our competitors pricing actions promotional offers and events and our customer’s desire for value and convenience

the division’s pharmacy sales gross margin and gross profit dollars are impacted by governmental agencies and other third party payers seeking to minimize increases in the costs of healthcare including pharmaceutical drug reimbursement rates in the united kingdom which is the division’s largest market for pharmacy sales the amount of government funding available for pharmacy services is typically reviewed and agreed with the pharmacy industry on an annual basis  in fiscal 2017 the uk department of health has indicated that they plan to implement funding cuts to reduce costs within the national health service the publiclyfunded healthcare system  

in addition performance as measured in us dollars is impacted by the exchange rates used to translate these amounts into us dollars the exchange rate of british pounds sterling being the most significant

pharmaceutical wholesale

our pharmaceutical wholesale division excluding equity method investments which mainly operates under the alliance healthcare brand supplies medicines other healthcare products and related services to more than 110000 pharmacies doctors health centers and hospitals each year from 288 distribution centers in 11 countries primarily in europe as of august 31 2016

the distribution of prescription medicines to pharmacists comprises the vast majority of the division’s sales our wholesale businesses seek to provide high core service levels to pharmacists in terms of frequency of delivery product availability delivery accuracy timeliness and reliability at competitive prices we also offer customers innovative addedvalue services to help pharmacists develop their own businesses this includes membership of alphega pharmacy our paneuropean network for independent pharmacies which as of august 31 2016 had over 5700 members

in addition to the wholesale of medicines and other healthcare products our businesses provide services to pharmaceutical manufacturers who are increasingly seeking to gain greater control over their product distribution while at the same time outsourcing noncore activities these services include prewholesale and contract logistics mainly under the alloga brand direct deliveries to pharmacies and innovative and specialized healthcare services covering clinical homecare medicine support dispensing services medicine preparation and clinical trial support mainly under the alcura brand

combined with local engagement scale is important in pharmaceutical wholesaling we are one of the largest pharmaceutical wholesalers and distributors in europe and we rank as one of the top three in market share in many of the individual countries in which we operate

our sales gross profit margin and gross profit dollars are impacted by among other things government actions which typically seek to reduce the growth in prescription drug consumption reduce reimbursement rates and increase generic drug utilization a greater proportion of generic drugs whether as a result of government actions generic conversions or other factors typically has an adverse effect on our revenues however in the wholesale division we typically earn equal or better gross margins on generic drugs than on branded drugs although there are exceptions

changes in manufacturers’ product distribution business models also can impact the division’s sales and gross margin for example when pharmaceutical drug manufacturers introduce feeforservice contracts it reduces our sales even if we are successful in winning these contracts as we only recognize sales for the amount of the fees charged other manufacturer services including our prewholesale and contract logistics operations are typically on a feeforservice basis

in addition performance as measured in us dollars is impacted by the exchange rates used to translate these amounts into us dollars the exchange rate of british pounds sterling and the euro being the most significant the division’s sales are subject to less seasonality than our other divisions

intellectual property and licenses 

we market products and services under various trademarks trade dress and trade names and rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark service mark and trade secret laws as well as contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights we own numerous domain names hold numerous patents have registered numerous trademarks and have filed applications for the registration of a number of our other trademarks and service marks in various jurisdictions we hold assorted business licenses such as pharmacy occupational liquor and cigarette having various lives within multiple legal jurisdictions which are necessary for the normal operation of our business

seasonal variations in business 

our business is affected by a number of factors including among others our sales performance during holiday periods including particularly the winter holiday season and during the cough cold and flu season the timing and severity of which is difficult to predict significant weather conditions the timing of our own or competitor discount programs and pricing actions and the timing of changes in levels of reimbursement from governmental agencies and other third party payers see “summary of quarterly results unaudited” in the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 below

sources and availability of raw materials 

inventories are purchased from numerous domestic and foreign suppliers we do not believe that the loss of any one supplier or group of suppliers under common control would have a material adverse effect on our business or that of any of our divisions

working capital practices 

effective inventory management is important to our operations we use various inventory management techniques including demand forecasting and planning and various forms of replenishment management our working capital needs typically are greater in the months leading up to the winter holiday season we generally finance our inventory and expansion needs with internally generated funds and shortterm borrowings for additional information see the liquidity and capital resources section in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii item 7 below

customers 

we sell to numerous retail and wholesale customers no single customer accounted for more than 10 of the company’s consolidated sales for any of the periods presented two payers   accounted for approximately 22  of the retail pharmacy usa division’s sales in fiscal 2016 one payer in the retail pharmacy international division accounted for approximately 18 of the division’s sales in fiscal 2016

regulation 

in the countries in which we do business we are subject to national state and local laws regulations and administrative practices concerning retail and wholesale pharmacy operations including regulations relating to our participation in medicare medicaid and other publicly financed health benefit plans regulations prohibiting kickbacks beneficiary inducement and the submission of false claims the health insurance portability and accountability act “hipaa” the aca licensure and registration requirements concerning the operation of pharmacies and the practice of pharmacy and regulations of the us food and drug administration the us federal trade commission the us drug enforcement administration and the us consumer product safety commission as well as regulations promulgated by comparable foreign state and local governmental authorities concerning the operation of our businesses we are also subject to laws and regulations relating to licensing tax foreign trade intellectual property privacy and data protection currency political and other business restrictions

competitive conditions 

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive as a leader in the retail pharmacy industry and as a retailer of general merchandise we compete with various local regional national and global retailers including chain and independent pharmacies mail order prescription providers grocery stores convenience stores mass merchants online and omnichannel pharmacies and retailers warehouse clubs dollar stores and other discount merchandisers our pharmaceutical wholesale businesses compete with other pharmaceutical wholesalers as well as alternative supply sources such as importers and manufacturers who supply directly to pharmacies we compete primarily on the basis of service convenience variety and price our geographic dispersion helps mitigate the impact of temporary localized economic and competitive conditions in individual markets see “properties” in part i item 2 below for further information regarding our geographic dispersion

 

 7  

employees 

as of august 31 2016 we employed approximately 360000 persons approximately 120000 of whom were parttime employees working less than 30 hours per week the foregoing does not include employees of unconsolidated partiallyowned entities

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information in this report and our other filings with the sec you should carefully consider the risks described below which could materially and adversely affect our business operations financial condition and results of operations these risks are not the only risks that we face our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial

reductions in third party reimbursement levels from private or governmental agency plans and potential changes in industry pricing benchmarks for prescription drugs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations

the substantial majority of the prescriptions we fill are reimbursed by third party payers including private and governmental agency payers the continued efforts of health maintenance organizations managed care organizations pharmacy benefit management companies governmental agencies and other third party payers to reduce prescription drug costs and pharmacy reimbursement rates as well as litigation and other legal proceedings relating to how drugs are priced may adversely impact our results of operations changes in political economic and regulatory influences also may significantly affect healthcare financing and prescription drug reimbursement practices in the united states plan changes with rate adjustments often occur in january and our reimbursement arrangements may provide for rate adjustments at prescribed intervals during their term in addition some of these entities may offer pricing terms that we may not be willing to accept or otherwise restrict our participation in their networks of pharmacy providers

in the united states for example certain provisions of the aca which was signed into law on march 23 2010 enacted subject to rulemaking a modified average manufacturer price used in the medicaid rebate and reimbursement formula for multisource drugs and in january 2016 the centers for medicare and medicaid services finalized a rule implementing the modified amp as well as a requirement that medicaid reimburse pharmacies at actual acquisition cost rather than estimated acquisition cost these changes which states had until may 2016 to implement generally are expected to reduce medicaid reimbursements and adversely affect our operating results there have also been a number of other proposals and enactments by the federal government and various states to reduce medicare part d and medicaid reimbursement levels in response to budget deficits and we expect additional proposals in the future in addition many payers in the united states are increasingly considering new metrics as the basis for reimbursement rates such as average sales price average manufacturer price and actual acquisition cost it is possible that the pharmaceutical industry or regulators may evaluate andor develop an alternative pricing reference to replace average wholesale price which is the pricing reference used for many of our contracts future changes to the pricing benchmarks used to establish pharmaceutical pricing including changes in the basis for calculating reimbursement by third party payers could adversely affect us there can be no assurance that recent or future changes in prescription drug reimbursement policies and practices will not materially and adversely affect our results of operations

 

in many countries in europe and elsewhere the government provides or subsidizes healthcare to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices patient eligibility and reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored healthcare system efforts to control healthcare costs including prescription drug costs are continuous 

a shift in pharmacy mix toward lower margin plans and programs could adversely affect our results of operations

 

a shift in the mix of pharmacy prescription volume towards programs offering lower reimbursement rates could adversely affect our results of operations our retail pharmacy usa division continued to experience a shift in pharmacy mix towards 90day at retail in fiscal 2016 and that trend may continue in fiscal 2017 our 90day at retail offering for patients with chronic prescription needs typically is at a lower margin than comparable 30day prescriptions our retail pharmacy usa division also experienced a shift in pharmacy mix towards medicare part d prescriptions in fiscal 2016 and we expect that trend to continue in fiscal 2017 preferred medicare part d networks have increased in number in recent years  however we do not participate in all such networks we have accepted lower reimbursement rates in order to secure preferred relationships with medicare part d plans serving senior patients with significant pharmacy needs we also have worked to develop and expand our relationships with commercial third party payers to enable new andor improved market access via participation in the pharmacy provider networks they offer if we are not able to generate additional prescription volume and other business from patients participating in these programs that is sufficient to offset the impact of lower reimbursement or if the degree or terms of our participation in such preferred networks declines from current levels in future years our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected

we could be adversely affected by a decrease in the introduction of new brand name and generic prescription drugs as well as increases in the cost to procure prescription drugs

 

new brand name drugs can result in increased drug utilization and associated sales while the introduction of lower priced generic alternatives typically results in relatively lower sales but relatively higher gross profit margins accordingly a decrease in the number or magnitude of significant new brand name drugs or generics successfully introduced or delays in their introduction could materially and adversely affect our results of operations

in addition if we experience an increase in the amounts we pay to procure pharmaceutical drugs including generic drugs it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations our gross profit margins would be adversely affected to the extent we are not able to offset such cost increases any failure to fully offset any such increased prices and costs or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations additionally any future changes in drug prices could be significantly different than our projections

we derive a significant portion of our sales in the united states from prescription drug sales reimbursed by pharmacy benefit management companies

 

we derive a significant portion of our sales in the united states from prescription drug sales reimbursed through prescription drug plans administered by pbm companies pbm companies typically administer multiple prescription drug plans that expire at various times and provide for varying reimbursement rates and often limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list known as a formulary which might not include all of the approved drugs for a particular indication there can be no assurance that we will continue to participate in any particular pbm company’s pharmacy provider network in any particular future time period if our participation in the pharmacy provider network for a prescription drug plan administered by one or more of the large pbm companies is restricted or terminated we expect that our sales would be adversely affected at least in the shortterm if we are unable to replace any such lost sales either through an increase in other sales or through a resumption of participation in those plans our operating results could be materially and adversely affected if we exit a pharmacy provider network and later resume participation there can be no assurance that we will achieve any particular level of business on any particular pace or that all clients of the pbm company will choose to include us again in the pharmacy network for their plans initially or at all in addition in such circumstances we may incur increased marketing and other costs in connection with initiatives to regain former patients and attract new patients covered by such plans

consolidation and strategic alliances in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business operations competitive positioning financial condition and results of operations

many organizations in the healthcare industry including pbm companies and health insurance companies have consolidated in recent years to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater bargaining power which has resulted in greater pricing pressures for example in july 2015 optumrx unitedhealth group’s pharmacy care services business completed its combination with catamaran corporation with the combined businesses becoming the third largest pbm company in the united states in addition significant business combinations within the health insurance industry are currently pending including the transactions contemplated by anthem inc’s agreement to acquire cigna corporation and aetna inc’s agreement to acquire humana inc if these pending transactions are completed the resulting enterprises are expected to be two of the three largest health insurers in the united states if this consolidation trend continues it could give the resulting enterprises even greater bargaining power which may lead to further pressure on the prices for our products and services if these pressures result in reductions in our prices our businesses would become less profitable unless we are able to achieve corresponding reductions in costs

new partnerships and strategic alliances in the healthcare industry also can alter market dynamics and impact our businesses and competitive positioning for example following the announcement of our agreement with amerisourcebergen providing for among other things generic drug purchasing through wbad our global sourcing enterprise some of our retail pharmacy competitors subsequently established relationships with other pharmaceutical drug wholesalers relating to generic drug procurement in addition further consolidation among generic drug manufacturers could lead to generic drug inflation in the future we expect that market demand government regulation thirdparty reimbursement policies government contracting requirements and other pressures will continue to cause the healthcare industry to evolve potentially resulting in further business consolidations and alliances and increased vertical integration among the industry participants we engage with and which could if we are not able to successfully anticipate and respond to evolving industry conditions in a timely and effective manner materially and adversely impact our business operations financial condition and results of operations

our growth strategy is partially dependent upon our ability to identify and successfully complete acquisitions joint ventures and other strategic alliances

a significant element of our growth strategy is to identify pursue and successfully complete acquisitions joint ventures and other strategic alliances that either expand or complement our existing operations we have grown significantly through acquisitions in recent years and expect to continue to acquire partner with or invest in businesses that build on or are deemed complementary to our existing businesses or further our strategic objectives due in part to consolidation in the industries in which we compete there is significant competition for attractive targets and opportunities when available there can be no assurance that attractive acquisition or other strategic relationship opportunities will be available that we will be successful in identifying negotiating and consummating favorable transaction opportunities or that any such transactions we complete will be successful and justify our investment of financial and other resources therein

acquisitions and other strategic transactions involve numerous risks including difficulties in successfully integrating the operations and personnel distraction of management from overseeing and disruption of our existing operations difficulties in entering markets or lines of business in which we have no or limited direct prior experience the possible loss of key employees and customers and difficulties in achieving the synergies we anticipated any failure to select suitable opportunities at fair prices conduct appropriate due diligence and successfully integrate the acquired company including particularly when acquired businesses operate in new geographic markets or areas of business could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations these transactions may also cause us to significantly increase our interest expense leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition or investment issue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders’ percentage ownership or incur asset writeoffs and restructuring costs and other related expenses that could have a material adverse impact on our operating results acquisitions joint ventures and strategic investments also involve numerous other risks including potential exposure to assumed litigation and unknown environmental and other liabilities as well as undetected internal control regulatory or other issues or additional costs not anticipated at the time the transaction was completed no assurance can be given that our acquisitions joint ventures and other strategic alliances will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business operations financial condition or results of operations if we are unable to successfully identify complete and integrate acquisitions joint ventures and strategic investments in a timely and effective manner our business operations and growth strategies could be negatively affected

we may not be able to successfully or timely complete the pending acquisition of rite aid

risks and uncertainties related to our pending acquisition of rite aid include among others the occurrence of any event change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement including that regulatory or other approvals required for the transaction are not obtained that litigation may be filed which could prevent or delay the transaction and that uncertainty regarding the transaction may adversely affect our and rite aid’s relationships with suppliers payers customers and other third parties with which we or rite aid do business

completion of the transaction is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the merger agreement including the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods and any extensions thereof under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 as amended no material adverse effect having occurred with respect to rite aid prior to the closing of the transaction and other customary conditions we will be unable to complete the pending acquisition of rite aid until each of the conditions to closing is either satisfied or waived in deciding whether or not to object to the transaction regulatory agencies have broad discretion in administering the applicable governing regulations as a condition to their approval of the transaction these agencies may impose requirements limitations or costs or require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of our business after consummation of the transaction these requirements limitations costs divestitures or restrictions may be burdensome to complete increase our costs reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction and materially and adversely affect our results of operations after the closing of the transaction we can provide no assurance that we will obtain the necessary approvals on any particular timetable or at all or that any such conditions that are imposed would not diminish the anticipated benefits of the transaction or result in the termination of the transaction in the event that the transaction is not completed due to the failure to obtain antitrust clearance we could be required to pay rite aid a termination fee of 325 million or 650 million in certain circumstances

while our acquisition of rite aid is pending it creates uncertainty that may adversely affect our and rite aid’s respective businesses and results of operations including with respect to relationships with suppliers payers customers and other third parties we have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the pending transaction as well as the diversion of management resources for which we will receive little or no benefit if the closing of the transaction does not occur further in the event that such merger is not consummated on or prior to june 1 2017 or if the merger agreement is terminated at any time on or prior to june 1 2017 then we would be required to redeem 35 billion aggregate principal amount of notes of various interest rates and maturities on the date described in the applicable note at a redemption price equal to 101 of the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the date of redemption see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – liquidity and capital resources” for additional information 

if we complete our pending acquisition of rite aid we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction which could adversely impact our results of operations

we entered into the merger agreement to acquire rite aid with the expectation that the transaction will result in various benefits including among other things cost savings and operating efficiencies the achievement of the anticipated benefits of the transaction is subject to a number of uncertainties including whether rite aid’s business can be integrated into ours in an efficient and effective manner the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding potential synergies and the integration process unforeseen expenses or delays and competitive factors in the marketplace if the rite aid transaction is completed we can provide no assurance that the anticipated benefits of the transaction including cost savings and synergies will be fully realized in the time frame anticipated or at all the costs or difficulties related to the integration of rite aid’s business and operations into ours will not be greater than expected unanticipated costs charges and expenses will not result from the transaction litigation relating to the transaction will not be filed we will be able to retain key personnel and the transaction will not cause disruption to the parties’ business and operations and relationships with employees and suppliers payers customers and other third parties if one or more of these risks are realized it could have a material adverse impact on our operating results

 

 11  

we could also encounter unforeseen transaction and integrationrelated costs or other circumstances such as unforeseen liabilities or other issues existing or arising with respect to the business of rite aid or otherwise resulting from the transaction many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs decreased revenue decreased synergies and the diversion of management time and attention which could adversely impact our agility to respond to market opportunities and our ability to timely identify and implement other strategic actions if we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame or at all the expected benefits may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations financial condition and results of operations in addition we have incurred significant transaction costs related to the acquisition and if the pending transaction is consummated we will continue to incur significant integration and related costs as we integrate the rite aid businesses these integration and acquisitionrelated costs including legal accounting financial and tax advisory and other fees and costs may be higher than expected and some of these costs may be material

our substantial operations outside of the united states subject us to a number of operating economic political regulatory and other international business risks

our substantial international business operations are important to our growth and prospects including particularly those of our retail pharmacy international and pharmaceutical wholesale divisions and are subject to a number of risks including

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these factors can also adversely affect our payers vendors and customers in international markets which in turn can negatively impact our businesses we cannot assure you that one or more of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations results of operation and financial condition

 

 12  

our retail pharmacy international and pharmaceutical wholesale divisions have substantial operations in the united kingdom and other member countries of the european union on june 23 2016 voters in the united kingdom approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the european union which proposed exit and the political economic and other uncertainties it has raised has exacerbated and may further exacerbate many of the risks and uncertainties described above negotiations on withdrawal and postexit arrangements likely will be complex and protracted and there can be no assurance regarding the terms timing or consummation of any such arrangements the proposed withdrawal could among other potential outcomes adversely affect the tax tax treaty currency operational legal and regulatory regimes to which our businesses in the region are subject the withdrawal could also among other potential outcomes disrupt the free movement of goods services and people between the united kingdom and the european union and significantly disrupt trade between the united kingdom and the european union and other parties further uncertainty around these and related issues could lead to adverse effects on the economy of the united kingdom and the other economies in which we operate there can be no assurance that any or all of these events will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations results of operations and financial condition

we are exposed to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations

our significant operations outside of the united states expose us to currency exchange rate fluctuations and related risks including transaction currency exposures relating to the import and export of goods in currencies other than businesses’ functional currencies as well as currency translation exposures relating to profits and net assets denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we present our financial statements in us dollars and have a significant proportion of net assets and income in nonus dollar currencies primarily british pounds sterling and the euro as well as a range of other foreign currencies our results of operations and capital ratios can therefore be sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future results of operations in addition fluctuations in currencies relative to the us dollar may make it more difficult to perform periodtoperiod comparisons of our reported results of operations a depreciation of nonus dollar currencies relative to the us dollar could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations

 

we may from time to time in some instances enter into foreign currency contracts or other derivative instruments intended to hedge a portion of our foreign currency fluctuation risks which subjects us to additional risks  such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations to us  that could materially and adversely affect us additionally we may and currently do use foreign currency borrowings to hedge some of our foreign currency fluctuation risks the periodic use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place we cannot assure you that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates including particularly the strengthening of the us dollar against major currencies or the currencies of large developing countries will not materially affect our consolidated financial results

our business results depend on our ability to successfully manage ongoing organizational change and achieve cost savings and operating efficiency initiatives

our board of directors approved the plan to implement the cost transformation program described in mda in part ii item 7 below as part of an initiative to reduce costs and increase operating efficiencies there can be no assurance that we will realize in full or in part the anticipated benefits of this program our financial goals assume a level of productivity improvement including those reflected in our cost transformation program and other business optimization initiatives if we are unable to deliver these expected productivity improvements while continuing to invest in business growth or if the volume and nature of change overwhelms available resources our business operations and financial results could be materially and adversely impacted our ability to successfully manage and execute these initiatives and realize expected savings and benefits in the amounts and at the times anticipated is important to our business success any failure to do so which could result from our inability to successfully execute plans changes in global or regional economic conditions competition changes in the industries in which we compete unanticipated costs or charges loss of key personnel and other factors described herein could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition and results of operations

disruption in our global supply chain could negatively impact our businesses

the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors and any future disruption in our supply chain or inability to find qualified vendors and access products that meet requisite quality and safety standards in a timely and efficient manner could adversely impact our businesses the loss or disruption of such supply arrangements for any reason including for issues such as labor disputes loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites inability to procure sufficient raw materials quality control issues ethical sourcing issues the supplier’s financial distress natural disasters civil unrest or acts of war or terrorism or other external factors over which we have no control could interrupt product supply and if not effectively managed and remedied have a material adverse impact on our business operations financial condition and results of operations

we use a single wholesaler of branded and generic pharmaceutical drugs as our primary source of such products for our retail pharmacy usa division

 

in march 2013 walgreens alliance boots and amerisourcebergen announced various agreements and arrangements including a tenyear pharmaceutical distribution agreement between walgreens and amerisourcebergen pursuant to which walgreens sources branded and generic pharmaceutical products from amerisourcebergen in the us and an agreement which provides amerisourcebergen the ability to access generics pharmaceutical products through wbad our global sourcing enterprise in may 2016 certain of these agreements were extended for three years to now expire in 2026 in addition in march 2013 walgreens alliance boots and amerisourcebergen entered into agreements and arrangements pursuant to which we have the right but not the obligation to purchase a minority equity position in amerisourcebergen and gain associated representation on amerisourcebergen’s board of directors in certain circumstances as of the date of this report amerisourcebergen distributes for our retail pharmacy usa division all branded pharmaceutical products that walgreens historically sourced from suppliers and distributors as well as substantially all generic pharmaceutical products that previously were selfdistributed consequently our business in the united states may be adversely affected by any operational financial or regulatory difficulties that amerisourcebergen experiences for example if amerisourcebergen’s operations are seriously disrupted for any reason whether due to a natural disaster labor disruption regulatory action computer or operational systems or otherwise it could adversely affect our business in the united states and our results of operations

our distribution agreement with amerisourcebergen is subject to early termination in certain circumstances and upon the expiration or termination of the agreement there can be no assurance that we or amerisourcebergen will be willing to renew the agreement or enter into a new agreement on terms favorable to us or at all if such expiration or termination occurred we believe that alternative sources of supply for most generic and brandname pharmaceuticals are readily available and that we could obtain and qualify alternative sources which may include resuming selfdistribution in some cases for substantially all of the prescription drugs we sell on an acceptable basis such that the impact of any expiration or termination would be temporary however there can be no assurance we would be able to engage alternative supply sources or implement selfdistribution processes on a timely basis or on terms favorable to us or effectively manage these transitions any of which could adversely affect our business operations financial condition and results of operations

the anticipated strategic and financial benefits of our relationship with amerisourcebergen may not be realized

we entered into the arrangement with amerisourcebergen with the expectation that the transactions contemplated thereby would result in various benefits including among other things procurement cost savings and operating efficiencies innovation and sharing of best practices the processes and initiatives needed to achieve these potential benefits are complex costly and timeconsuming many of the anticipated synergies and expenses that will be incurred by their nature are difficult to estimate accurately at the present time achieving the anticipated benefits from the arrangement is subject to a number of significant challenges and uncertainties including the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations processes or initiatives or the inability to realize andor delays in realizing potential benefits and synergies whether unique corporate cultures of separate organizations will work collaboratively in an efficient and effective manner unforeseen expenses or delays and competitive factors in the marketplace

as of august 31 2016 we beneficially owned approximately 24 of the outstanding amerisourcebergen common stock and had designated one member of amerisourcebergen’s board of directors in addition we have the right but not the obligation under the transactions contemplated by the framework agreement dated as of march 18 2013 by and among the company alliance boots and amerisourcebergen the “framework agreement” to acquire up to an additional 8398752 amerisourcebergen shares in the open market and thereafter designate another member of amerisourcebergen’s board of directors subject in each case to applicable legal and contractual requirements there can be no assurance that we will complete any specific level of such potential equity investments in amerisourcebergen or that our existing investment or any future investment if completed will ultimately be profitable if the price of amerisourcebergen common stock subsequently declines substantially we could experience a loss on or impairment of such investment which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations further our ability to transact in amerisourcebergen securities is subject to certain restrictions set forth in our agreements with amerisourcebergen and arising under applicable laws and regulations which in some circumstances could adversely our ability to transact in amerisourcebergen securities in amounts and at the times desired we could also encounter unforeseen costs circumstances or issues existing or arising with respect to the transactions and collaboration we anticipate resulting from the framework agreement many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs decreased revenue decreased synergies and the diversion of management time and attention if we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame or at all the expected benefits may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations financial condition and results of operations

 

 14  

from time to time we make investments in companies over which we do not have sole control including our investment in amerisourcebergen some of these companies may operate in sectors that differ from our current operations and have different risks

from time to time we make debt or equity investments in other companies that we may not control or over which we may not have sole control for example while we have a significant equity investment in amerisourcebergen and have a designee serving on the board of directors of amerisourcebergen as of the date of this report we do not and will not have the ability to control daytoday operations of that company although the businesses in which we have made noncontrolling investments often have a significant health and daily living or prescription drug component some of them operate in businesses that are different from our primary lines of business andor operate in different geographic markets than we do investments in these businesses among other risks subject us to the operating and financial risks of the businesses we invest in and to the risk that we do not have sole control over the operations of these businesses we rely on the internal controls and financial reporting controls of these entities and their failure to maintain effectiveness or comply with applicable standards may materially and adversely affect us investments in entities over which we do not have sole control including joint ventures and strategic alliances present additional risks such as having differing objectives from our partners or the entities in which we are invested becoming involved in disputes or competing with those persons from time to time we may make additional investments in or acquire other entities that may subject us to similar risks

changes in economic conditions could adversely affect consumer buying practices

our performance has been and may continue to be adversely impacted by changes in global national regional or local economic conditions and consumer confidence these conditions can also adversely affect our key vendors and customers external factors that affect consumer confidence and over which we exercise no influence include unemployment rates levels of personal disposable income levels of taxes and interest and global national regional or local economic conditions as well as acts of war or terrorism changes in economic conditions and consumer confidence could adversely affect consumer preferences purchasing power and spending patterns which could lead to a decrease in overall consumer spending in addition reduced or flat consumer spending may drive us and our competitors to offer additional products at promotional prices all of these factors could materially and adversely impact our business operations financial condition and results of operations

economic conditions in europe and certain emerging market countries together with austerity measures being taken by certain governments could adversely affect us

we have significant assets and operations within europe and certain emerging market countries in our retail pharmacy international and pharmaceutical wholesale divisions an economic slowdown within any such markets could adversely affect our businesses in affected regions by reducing the prices our customers may be able or willing to pay for our products and services or by reducing the demand for our products and services either of which could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations in recent years in response to the economic environment a number of governments have announced or implemented austerity measures to reduce healthcare spending for the governmentsponsored healthcare system and constrain overall government expenditures these measures which include efforts aimed at reforming healthcare coverage and reducing healthcare costs continue to exert pressure on the pricing of and reimbursement timelines for pharmaceutical drugs countries with existing austerity measures may impose additional laws regulations or requirements on the healthcare industry in addition governments that have not yet imposed austerity measures may impose them in the future any new austerity measures may be similar to or vary in scope and nature from existing austerity measures and could have a material adverse effect on our international business operations and results of operations

 

 15  

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and constantly evolving new entrants to the market existing competitor actions or other changes in market dynamics could adversely impact us

the level of competition among retail pharmacies and pharmaceutical wholesalers is high changes in market dynamics or actions of competitors or manufacturers including industry consolidation and the emergence of new competitors and strategic alliances could materially and adversely impact us disruptive innovation by existing or new competitors could alter the competitive landscape in the future and require us to accurately identify and assess such changes and make timely and effective changes to our strategies and business model to compete effectively our retail pharmacy businesses face intense competition from local regional national and global companies including other drugstore and pharmacy chains independent drugstores and pharmacies mailorder prescription providers and various other retailers such as grocery stores convenience stores mass merchants online and omnichannel pharmacies and retailers warehouse clubs dollar stores and other discount merchandisers some of which are aggressively expanding in markets we serve businesses in our pharmaceutical wholesale division face intense competition from direct competitors including national and regional cooperative wholesalers and alternative supply sources such as importers and manufacturers who supply directly to pharmacies competition may also come from other sources in the future as competition increases in the markets in which we operate a significant increase in general pricing pressures could occur which could require us to reevaluate our pricing structures to remain competitive for example if we are not able to anticipate and successfully respond to changes in market conditions in our pharmaceutical wholesale division including changes driven by competitors suppliers or manufacturers and increased competition from national and regional cooperative wholesalers it could result in a loss of customers or renewal of contracts or arrangements on less favorable terms

we also could be adversely affected if we fail to identify or effectively respond to changes in market dynamics for example specialty pharmacy represents a significant and growing proportion of prescription drug spending in the united states a significant portion of which is dispensed outside of traditional retail pharmacies because our specialty pharmacy business focuses on complex and highcost medications that serve a relatively limited universe of patients the future growth of this business depends to a significant extent upon expanding our ability to access key drugs and successfully penetrate key treatment categories if we are not able to compete effectively in this evolving market it could have an adverse effect on our business operations financial condition and results of operations

if the merchandise and services that we offer fail to meet customer needs our sales may be adversely affected

we could be adversely affected by changes in consumer spending levels and shopping habits and preferences including attitudes towards our retail and product brands the success of our retail pharmacy businesses depends on our ability to offer a superior shopping experience engaging customer service and a quality assortment of available merchandise that differentiates us from other retailers including enhanced health and beauty product offerings we must identify obtain supplies of and offer to our customers attractive innovative and highquality merchandise on a continuous basis our products and services must satisfy the needs and desires of our customers whose preferences may change in the future it is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand if we misjudge either the demand for products and services we sell or our customers’ purchasing habits and tastes we may be faced with excess inventories of some products and missed opportunities for products and services we chose not to offer in addition our sales may decline or we may be required to sell the merchandise we have obtained at lower prices failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences and spending patterns and evolving demographic mixes in the markets we serve could negatively affect our relationship with our customers and the demand for our products and services which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations

our private brand offerings expose us to various additional risks

in addition to brand name products we offer our customers private brand products that are not available from other retailers we seek to continue to grow our exclusive private brand offerings as part of our growth strategy including through the expanded offering of no7 and other brands owned or licensed on an exclusive basis as well as through selective acquisitions maintaining consistent product quality competitive pricing and availability of our private brand offerings for our customers as well as the timely development and introduction of new products is important in differentiating us from other retailers and developing and maintaining customer loyalty although we believe that our private brand products offer value to our customers and typically provide us with higher gross margins than comparable national brand products we sell the expansion of our private brand offerings also subjects us to additional risks such as potential product liability risks and mandatory or voluntary product recalls our ability to successfully protect our proprietary rights and successfully navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties our ability to successfully administer and comply with applicable contractual obligations and regulatory requirements and other risks generally encountered by entities that source sell and market exclusive branded offerings for retail an increase in sales of our private brands may also adversely affect sales of our vendors’ products which in turn could adversely affect our relationship with certain of our vendors any failure to adequately address some or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business operations results of operations and financial condition

if we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant omnichannel experience for our customers our businesses and results of operations could be adversely impacted

 

our business has evolved from an instore experience to interaction with customers across numerous channels including instore online mobile and social media among others omnichannel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing customer expectations and new developments by our competitors for example in july 2016 we announced that we would cease operations at our drugstorecom and beauty com properties in furtherance of our omnichannel strategy and initiatives to greater focus on the development of walgreens com in the united states  our customers are increasingly using computers tablets mobile phones and other devices to comparison shop determine product availability and complete purchases online we must compete by offering a consistent and convenient shopping experience for our customers regardless of the ultimate sales channel and by investing in providing and maintaining digital tools for our customers that have the right features and are reliable and easy to use if we are unable to make improve or develop relevant customerfacing technology in a timely manner our ability to compete and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected in addition if our online activities or our other customerfacing technology systems do not function as designed we may experience a loss of customer confidence data security breaches lost sales or be exposed to fraudulent purchases any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations reputation and results of operations

we may be constrained if we are unable to find suitable new store locations at acceptable prices or by the terms of our current leases

our ability to grow our retail pharmacy businesses may be constrained if suitable new store locations cannot be identified with lease terms or purchase prices that are acceptable to us we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores local land use and other regulations applicable to the types of stores we desire to construct may impact our ability to find suitable locations and influence the cost of constructing our stores the termination or expiration of leases at existing store locations may adversely affect us if the renewal terms of those leases are unacceptable to us and we are forced to close or relocate stores further changing local demographics at existing store locations may adversely affect revenue and profitability levels at those stores

we may experience a significant disruption in our computer systems

we rely extensively on our computer systems to manage our ordering pricing pointofsale pharmacy fulfillment inventory replenishment customer loyalty programs finance and other processes our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches vandalism natural disasters catastrophic events and human error and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities if any of our systems are damaged fail to function properly or otherwise become unavailable we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience loss or corruption of critical data and interruptions or disruptions and delays in our ability to perform critical functions which could materially and adversely affect our businesses and results of operations in addition we are currently making and expect to continue to make substantial investments in our information technology systems and infrastructure some of which are significant upgrades involve replacing existing systems with successor systems making changes to existing systems or costeffectively acquiring new systems with new functionality implementing new systems carries significant potential risks including failure to operate as designed potential loss or corruption of data or information cost overruns implementation delays disruption of operations and the potential inability to meet business and reporting requirements while we are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems and believe we are taking reasonable action to mitigate known risks there can be no assurance that we will not experience significant issues with our existing systems prior to implementation that our technology initiatives will be successfully deployed as planned or that they will be timely implemented without significant disruption to our operations we also could be adversely affected by any significant disruption in the systems of third parties we interact with including key payers and vendors

if we or the businesses we interact with do not maintain the privacy and security of sensitive customer and business information it could damage our reputation and we could suffer a loss of revenue incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation and regulatory scrutiny

the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding with the frequent imposition of new and changing requirements across businesses we are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing data privacy regulations in the united states and in other countries in which we operate that regulate the collection use and transfer of personal data including the transfer of personal data between or among countries some foreign data privacy regulations are more stringent than those in the united states and continue to change for example in may 2016 the general data protection regulation was formally published in the journal of the european union and comes into effect in may 2018 complying with these and other changing requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs and require us to change our business practices in certain jurisdictions any of which could materially adversely affect our business operations and operating results we may also face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations compliance with changes in privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes if we or those with whom we share information fail to comply with these laws and regulations or experience a data security breach our reputation could be damaged and we could be subject to additional litigation and regulatory risks our security measures may be undermined due to the actions of outside parties employee error malfeasance or otherwise and as a result an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate business and personal information because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure damage to our reputation and potentially have a material adverse effect on our business operations financial condition and results of operations

we are subject to paymentrelated risks that could increase our operating costs expose us to fraud or theft subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business operations

we accept payments using a variety of methods including cash checks credit and debit cards gift cards and mobile payment technologies such as apple pay™ and we may offer new payment options over time acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules regulations contractual obligations and compliance requirements including payment network rules and operating guidelines data security standards and certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers these requirements and related interpretations may change over time which could make compliance more difficult or costly for certain payment methods including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which could increase over time and raise our operating costs we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards and other forms of electronic payment if these companies become unable to provide these services to us or if their systems are compromised it could disrupt our business the payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by persons who seek to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit any weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems if we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements or if data is compromised due to a breach or misuse of data relating to our payment systems we may be liable for costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments could be impaired in addition our reputation could suffer and our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types which could result in higher costs andor reduced sales and materially and adversely affect our results of operations

changes in healthcare regulatory environments may adversely affect our businesses

political economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to significant changes that could adversely affect our results of operations in recent years the healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to reduce costs and government spending these changes include an increased reliance on managed care cuts in certain medicare and medicaid funding in the united states and the funding of governmental payers in foreign jurisdictions consolidation of competitors suppliers and other market participants and the development of large sophisticated purchasing groups we expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future some of these potential changes such as a reduction in governmental funding for certain healthcare services or adverse changes in legislation or regulations governing prescription drug pricing healthcare services or mandated benefits may cause customers to reduce the amount of our products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services we expect continued governmental and private payer pressure to reduce pharmaceutical pricing changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers’ pricing or distribution policies could also significantly reduce our profitability

the aca was enacted in 2010 to provide health insurance coverage to millions of previously uninsured americans through a combination of insurance market reforms an expansion of medicaid subsidies and health insurance mandates while certain provisions of the aca have already taken effect others have delayed effective dates or require further rulemaking action or regulatory guidance by governmental agencies to implement in addition various market participants continue to react to these regulatory changes as a result there remains uncertainty as to the full impact of aca on our business operations future rulemaking or other regulatory actions under the aca or otherwise could increase regulation of pharmacy services result in changes to pharmacy reimbursement rates and otherwise change the way we do business we cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking or other regulatory actions but any such actions could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations

a significant change in or noncompliance with governmental regulations and other legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and profitability

we operate in complex highly regulated environments in the united states and in the other countries in which we operate and could be adversely affected by changes to existing legal requirements new legal requirements andor any failure to comply with applicable regulations businesses in our pharmaceutical wholesale division are subject to a range of regulations relating to such things as product margins product traceability and the conditions under which products must be stored our retail pharmacy and health and wellness services businesses are subject to numerous country state and local regulations including licensing and other requirements for pharmacies and reimbursement arrangements the regulations to which we are subject include but are not limited to country and state registration and regulation of pharmacies and drug discount card programs dispensing and sale of controlled substances and products containing pseudoephedrine applicable governmental payer regulations including medicare and medicaid data privacy and security laws and regulations including hipaa the aca laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters including those governing exposure to and the management and disposal of hazardous substances regulations regarding food and drug safety including those of the us food and drug administration “fda” and drug enforcement administration “dea” trade regulations including those of the us federal trade commission and consumer protection and safety regulations including those of the consumer product safety commission as well as state regulatory authorities governing the availability sale advertisement and promotion of products we sell antikickback laws false claims laws laws against the corporate practice of medicine and foreign national and state laws governing the practice of the profession of pharmacy for example in the united states the dea fda and various other regulatory authorities regulate the distribution and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances we are required to hold valid dea and statelevel licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with the controlled substance act and its accompanying regulations governing the sale dispensing disposal holding and distribution of controlled substances the dea fda and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations we are also governed by foreign national and state laws of general applicability including laws regulating matters of working conditions health and safety and equal employment opportunity and other labor and employment matters as well as competition and antitrust matters in addition we could have significant exposure if we are found to have infringed another party’s intellectual property rights

changes in laws regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may alter the landscape in which we do business and may affect our costs of doing business the impact of new laws regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices generally cannot be predicted and changes in applicable laws regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may require extensive system and operational changes be difficult to implement increase our operating costs and require significant capital expenditures untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties that could adversely affect the continued operation of our businesses including suspension of payments from government programs loss of required government certifications loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government programs including the medicare and medicaid programs in the united states and the national health service in the united kingdom loss of licenses and significant fines or monetary penalties any failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements in the united states or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in significant legal and financial exposure damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business operations financial condition and results of operations

we could be adversely affected by product liability product recall personal injury or other health and safety issues

we could be adversely impacted by the supply of defective products including the infiltration of counterfeit products into the supply chain errors in relabelling of products product tampering product recall and contamination or product mishandling issues through our pharmacies and specialist packaging sites we are also exposed to risks relating to the services we provide errors in the dispensing and packaging of pharmaceuticals could lead to serious injury or death product liability or personal injury claims may be asserted against us with respect to any of the products or pharmaceuticals we sell or services we provide our healthcare clinics also increase our exposure to professional liability claims related to medical care should a product or other liability issue arise the coverage limits under our insurance programs and the indemnification amounts available to us may not be adequate to protect us against claims and judgments we also may not be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms in the future we could suffer significant reputational damage and financial liability if we or any affiliated entities experience any of the foregoing health and safety issues or incidents which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations financial condition and results of operations

we have significant outstanding debt our debt and associated payment obligations could significantly increase in the future if we incur additional debt and do not retire existing debt

we have outstanding debt and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity as of august 31 2016 we had approximately 19 billion of outstanding indebtedness including shortterm borrowings our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we may incur or assume significantly more debt in the future including in connection with acquisitions strategic investments or joint ventures for example we incurred significant additional debt in november 2014 in connection with the second step transaction and in june 2016 as part of our intended financing for the pending rite aid transaction we will incur significant additional debt upon the closing of the pending rite aid transaction including pursuant to the 2015 credit agreements see note 9 borrowings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for additional information regarding our financing plans and arrangements in addition if the pending acquisition of rite aid is completed the thenoutstanding rite aid indebtedness we acquire upon closing is expected to be substantial if we add new debt and do not retire existing debt the risks described above could increase we also could be adversely impacted by any failure to renew or replace on terms acceptable to us or at all existing funding arrangements when they expire and any failure to satisfy applicable covenants

our longterm debt obligations include covenants that may adversely affect our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur certain secured indebtedness or engage in certain types of transactions in addition our existing credit agreements require us to maintain as of the last day of each fiscal quarter a ratio of consolidated debt to total capitalization not to exceed a certain level our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants may be affected by events beyond our control if we breach any of these restrictions or covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable this could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition

 

we could be adversely affected by downgrades to our credit ratings or disruptions in our ability to access wellfunctioning capital markets

 

 20  

we could be adversely affected by downgrades to our credit ratings or disruptions in our ability to access wellfunctioning capital markets

historically we have relied on the public debt capital markets to fund portions of our capital investments and access to the commercial paper market and bank credit facilities as part of our working capital management strategy our continued access to these markets and the terms of such access depend on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets our operating performance and our credit ratings the major credit rating agencies have assigned us and our corporate debt investment grade credit ratings these ratings are based on a number of factors which include their assessment of our financial strength and financial policies we benefit from investment grade ratings as they serve to lower our borrowing costs and facilitate our access to a variety of lenders and other creditors including landlords for our leased stores on terms that we consider advantageous to our businesses however there can be no assurance that any particular rating assigned to us will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency if in that rating agency’s judgment future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating so warrant incurrence of additional debt by us including if the pending acquisition of rite aid is completed outstanding rite aid indebtedness we acquire upon closing and additional debt we incur in connection with the financing of the transaction could adversely affect our credit ratings we depend on banks and other financial institutions to provide credit to our business and perform under our agreements with them defaults by one or more of these counterparties on their obligations to us could materially and adversely affect us any disruptions or turmoil in the capital markets or any downgrade of our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets and increase the cost of and counterparty risks associated with existing facilities which could materially and adversely affect our business operations financial condition and results of operations

as a holding company walgreens boots alliance is dependent on funding from its operating subsidiaries to pay dividends and other obligations

walgreens boots alliance is a holding company with no business operations of its own its assets primarily consist of direct and indirect ownership interests in and its business is conducted through subsidiaries which are separate legal entities as a result it is dependent on funding from its subsidiaries including walgreens and alliance boots to meet its obligations additionally walgreens boots alliance’s subsidiaries may be restricted in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions to walgreens boots alliance which may limit the payment of cash dividends or other distributions to the holders of walgreens boots alliance common stock credit facilities and other debt obligations of walgreens boots alliance as well as statutory provisions may further limit the ability of walgreens boots alliance and its subsidiaries to pay dividends payments to walgreens boots alliance by its subsidiaries are also contingent upon its subsidiaries’ earnings and business considerations

our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly

our operating results have historically varied on a quarterly basis and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future factors that may affect our quarterly operating results some of which are beyond the control of management include but are not limited to the timing of the introduction of new generic and brand name prescription drugs inflation including with respect to generic drug procurement costs the timing and severity of the cough cold and flu season changes in payer reimbursement rates and terms fluctuations in inventory energy transportation labor healthcare and other costs significant acquisitions dispositions joint ventures and other strategic initiatives asset impairment charges the relative magnitude of our lifo provision in any particular quarter foreign currency fluctuations seasonality prolonged severe weather in key markets and many of the other risk factors discussed herein accordingly we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and investors should not rely on the results of any particular quarter as an indication of our future performance

our businesses are seasonal in nature and adverse events during the holiday and cough cold and flu seasons could adversely impact our operating results

our businesses are seasonal in nature with the second fiscal quarter december january and february typically generating a higher proportion of retail sales and earnings than other fiscal quarters we purchase significant amounts of seasonal inventory in anticipation of the holiday season adverse events such as deteriorating economic conditions higher unemployment higher gas prices public transportation disruptions or unanticipated adverse weather could result in lowerthanplanned sales during key selling seasons for example frequent or unusually heavy snowfall ice storms rainstorms windstorms or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period could make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and increase our snow removal and other costs this could lead to lower sales or to unanticipated markdowns negatively impacting our financial condition and results of operations in addition both prescription and nonprescription drug sales are affected by the timing and severity of the cough cold and flu season which can vary considerably from year to year

 

 21  

we could be adversely impacted by changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters

 

generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our businesses including but not limited to revenue recognition asset impairment impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets inventories vendor rebates and other vendor consideration lease obligations selfinsurance liabilities tax matters unclaimed property laws and litigation and other contingent liabilities are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition for example changes in accounting standards and the application of existing accounting standards particularly related to the measurement of fair value as compared to carrying value for the company’s reporting units including goodwill intangible assets and investments in equity interests including investments held by our equity method investees may have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include significant adverse changes in the business climate and declines in the financial condition of a reporting unit factors that could lead to impairment of investments in equity interests of the companies in which we invested or the investments held by those companies include a prolonged period of decline in their operating performance or adverse changes in the economic regulatory and legal environments of the countries in which they operate in

new accounting guidance also may require systems and other changes that could increase our operating costs andor significantly change our financial statements for example in february 2016 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “ asu ” 201602 leases topic 842 which supersedes topic 840 leases this asu which is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2018 fiscal 2020 seeks to increase the transparency and comparability of organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements see “new accounting pronouncements” within note 2 summary of major accounting policies  implementing this asu as well as other future accounting guidance such as that related to revenue and other areas impacted by the current convergence project between the fasb and the international accounting standards board could require us to make significant changes to our lease management system or other accounting systems and could result in significant adverse changes to our financial statements

we have a substantial amount of goodwill and other intangible assets which could in the future become impaired and result in material noncash charges to our results of operations

as of august 31 2016 we had 258 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets most of which relates to the acquisition of alliance boots completed on december 31 2014 we accounted for the second step transaction using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with gaap with the purchase price paid allocated to recognize the acquired assets and liabilities at their fair value at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment in the carrying value as defined by gaap we will evaluate this goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount estimated fair values could change if for example there are changes in the business climate changes in the competitive environment adverse legal or regulatory actions or developments changes in capital structure cost of debt interest rates capital expenditure levels operating cash flows or market capitalization because of the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets any future impairment of these assets could require material noncash charges to our results of operations which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

 

 22  

we are exposed to risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings

 

we operate in a highly regulated and litigious environment we are involved in litigation arbitration and other legal proceedings and subject to investigations inspections audits inquiries and similar actions by governmental authorities arising in the course of our businesses including those contained in note 12 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this form 10k legal proceedings in general and securities and class action litigation in particular can be expensive and disruptive some of these suits may purport or may be determined to be class actions andor involve parties seeking large andor indeterminate amounts including punitive or exemplary damages and may remain unresolved for several years in addition under the qui tam or “whistleblower” provisions of the federal and various state false claims acts persons may bring lawsuits alleging that a violation of the federal antikickback statute or similar laws has resulted in the submission of “false” claims to federal andor state healthcare programs including medicare and medicaid from time to time we are also involved in legal proceedings as a plaintiff involving antitrust tax contract intellectual property and other matters we cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies and the costs incurred in litigation can be substantial regardless of the outcome substantial unanticipated verdicts fines and rulings do sometimes occur as a result we could from time to time incur judgments enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters and such developments could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued andor our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid the outcome of some of these legal proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could negatively affect our operations additionally defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management’s attention and resources

we could be adversely affected by violations of antibribery anticorruption andor international trade laws

we are subject to laws concerning our business operations and marketing activities in foreign countries where we conduct business for example we are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” us export control antimoney laundering and trade sanction laws and similar anticorruption and international trade laws in certain foreign countries such as the uk bribery act any violation of which could create substantial liability for us and also harm our reputation the fcpa generally prohibits us companies and their officers directors employees and intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment the fcpa also requires that us public companies maintain books and records that fairly and accurately reflect transactions and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls if we are found to have violated the fcpa or any other antibribery anticorruption or international trade laws we may face sanctions including civil and criminal fines disgorgement of profits and suspension or debarment of our ability to contract with governmental agencies or receive export licenses in addition new initiatives may be proposed from time to time that impact the trading conditions in certain countries or regions and may include retaliatory duties or trade sanctions which if enacted could adversely impact our trading relationships with vendors or other parties in such locations and have a material adverse effect on our operations from time to time we may face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign governmental agencies relating to our international business activities compliance with which could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations an adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could damage our reputation and subject us to fines or other penalties which could materially and adversely affect our business operations financial condition and results of operations

we could be subject to adverse changes in tax laws regulations and interpretations or challenges to our tax positions

we are a large corporation with operations in the united states and numerous other jurisdictions around the world as such we are subject to tax laws and regulations of the united states federal state and local governments as well as various foreign jurisdictions we compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate as the tax rates vary among jurisdictions a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision from time to time legislative initiatives are proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions effective tax rate tax payments or financial condition in addition tax laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations and any significant failure to comply with applicable tax laws and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions could give rise to substantial penalties and liabilities any change in enacted tax laws rules or regulatory or judicial interpretations any adverse outcome in connection with tax audits in any jurisdiction or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could adversely affect our effective tax rate tax payments and results of operations

our insurance programs may expose us to unexpected costs

we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance to provide for potential liability for workers’ compensation automobile and general liability property director and officers’ liability and employee healthcare benefits provisions for losses related to selfinsured risks generally are based upon actuarially determined estimates any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability changes in legal claims trends and interpretations variability in inflation rates changes in the nature and method of claims settlement benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws insolvency of insurance carriers and changes in discount rates could all materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

 

 23  

we could be adversely impacted by changes in assumptions used in calculating pension assets and liabilities

 

we operate certain defined benefit pension plans in the united kingdom which were closed to new entrants in 2010 as well as smaller plans in other jurisdictions the valuation of the pension plan’s assets and liabilities depends in part on assumptions which are primarily based on the financial markets as well as longevity and employee retention rates this valuation is particularly sensitive to material changes in the value of equity bond and other investments held by the pension plans changes in the corporate bond yields which are used in the measurement of the liabilities changes in market expectations for longterm price inflation and new evidence on projected longevity rates funding requirements and the impact on the statement of earnings relating to these pension plans are also influenced by these factors adverse changes in the assumptions used to calculate the value of pension assets and liabilities including lower than expected pension fund investment returns andor increased life expectancy of plan participants or regulatory change could require us to increase the funding of its defined benefit pension plans or incur higher expenses which would adversely impact our results of operations and financial position

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws delaware law andor our agreements with certain stockholders may impede the ability of our stockholders to make changes to our board or impede a takeover

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere herein and the description of the company’s business and reportable segments in item 1 above this discussion contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in forwardlooking statements factors that might cause a difference include but are not limited to those discussed under “cautionary note regarding forwardlooking statements” below and in “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this form 10k references herein to the “company” “we” “us” or “our” refer to walgreens boots alliance inc and its subsidiaries from and after the effective time of the reorganization on december 31 2014 and prior to that time to its predecessor walgreen co and its subsidiaries and in each case do not include unconsolidated partiallyowned entities except as otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires

introduction 

on december 31 2014 walgreens boots alliance inc “walgreens boots alliance” became the successor to walgreen co “walgreens” pursuant to a merger to effect a reorganization of walgreens into a holding company structure the “reorganization” with walgreens boots alliance becoming the parent holding company pursuant to the reorganization walgreens became a wholly owned subsidiary of walgreens boots alliance a delaware corporation formed for the purposes of the reorganization and each issued and outstanding share of walgreens common stock converted on a onetoone basis into walgreens boots alliance common stock also on december 31 2014 following the completion of the reorganization walgreens boots alliance completed the acquisition of the remaining 55 of alliance boots gmbh “alliance boots” that walgreens did not previously own the “second step transaction” in exchange for £3133 billion in cash and 1443 million shares of walgreens boots alliance common stock alliance boots became a consolidated subsidiary and ceased being accounted for under the equity method immediately upon completion of the second step transaction for financial reporting and accounting purposes walgreens boots alliance was the acquirer of alliance boots the consolidated financial statements and other data such as prescriptions filled reflect the results of operations and financial position of walgreens and its subsidiaries for periods prior to december 31 2014 and of walgreens boots alliance and its subsidiaries for periods from and after the effective time of the reorganization on december 31 2014

on october 27 2015 walgreens boots alliance entered into an agreement and plan of merger with rite aid corporation “rite aid” and victoria merger sub inc a whollyowned subsidiary of walgreens boots alliance the “merger agreement” pursuant to which we agreed subject to the terms and conditions thereof to acquire rite aid a drugstore chain in the united states with 4550 stores in 31 states and the district of columbia as of august 27 2016 the merger agreement was approved by rite aid stockholders in february 2016 the transaction is expected to close in early calendar year 2017  subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions  

 

comparability 

as a result of the completion of the second step transaction on december 31 2014 there are a number of items that affect comparability of reported results prior to december 31 2014 our operations were within one reportable segment that included the results of the retail pharmacy usa division and corporate costs along with the full consolidated results of walgreens boots alliance development gmbh “wbad” a global sourcing enterprise formed by walgreens and alliance boots and equity earnings from alliance boots following the completion of the reorganization and the second step transaction on december 31 2014 we now report results in three segments segmental reporting includes the allocation of synergy benefits including wbad’s results and the combined corporate costs for periods subsequent to december 31 2014 we have determined that it is impracticable to allocate historical results to the current segmental presentation accordingly our retail pharmacy usa segment results for periods prior to december 31 2014 include all corporate costs of walgreens the full consolidated results of wbad and equity income from walgreens’ premerger 45 interest in alliance boots

the completion of the second step transaction on december 31 2014 also means that results for the twelve month period ended august 31 2016 include the results of alliance boots on a fully consolidated basis while the twelve month period ended august 31 2015 includes the results of alliance boots for eight months january through august 2015 on a fully consolidated basis and as equity income from walgreens’ premerger 45 interest in alliance boots for four months september through december 2014

twelve month periodoverperiod comparisons of results require consideration of the foregoing factors and are not directly comparable

in addition our sales results are affected by a number of factors including our sales performance during holiday periods and during the cough cold and flu season foreign currency fluctuations significant weather conditions timing of our own or competitor discount programs and pricing actions levels of reimbursement from governmental agencies and other third party payers and general economic conditions in the markets in which we operate

to improve comparability certain classification changes have been made to prior period sales cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses this change has no impact on operating income

amerisourcebergen corporation relationship 

in march 2013 walgreens alliance boots and amerisourcebergen announced various agreements and arrangements including a tenyear pharmaceutical distribution agreement between walgreens and amerisourcebergen pursuant to which branded and generic pharmaceutical products are sourced from amerisourcebergen in the united states and an agreement which provides amerisourcebergen the ability to access generics pharmaceutical products through wbad in may 2016 certain of these agreements were extended for three years to now expire in 2026

 

in addition in march 2013 walgreens alliance boots and amerisourcebergen entered into agreements and arrangements pursuant to which we have the right but not the obligation to purchase a minority equity position in amerisourcebergen over time through open market purchases and pursuant to warrants to acquire amerisourcebergen common stock and gain associated representation on amerisourcebergen’s board of directors in certain circumstances please refer to our form 8k filed on march 20 2013 for more detailed information regarding these agreements and arrangements 

on march 18 2016 we exercised warrants to purchase 22696912 shares of amerisourcebergen common stock at an exercise price of 5150 per share for an aggregate exercise price payment of 117 billion on august 25 2016 we exercised additional warrants to purchase 22696912 shares of amerisourcebergen common stock at an exercise price of 5250 per share for an aggregate exercise price payment of 119 billion as of august 31 2016 we owned 56854867 amerisourcebergen common shares representing approximately 24 of the outstanding amerisourcebergen common stock and had designated one member of amerisourcebergen’s board of directors as of august 31 2016 we can acquire up to an additional 8398752 amerisourcebergen shares in the open market and thereafter designate another member of amerisourcebergen’s board of directors subject in each case to applicable legal and contractual requirements the amount of permitted open market purchases is subject to increase or decrease in certain circumstances

effective march 18 2016 we account for our investment in amerisourcebergen using the equity method of accounting subject to a twomonth reporting lag with the net earnings attributable to our investment being classified within the operating income of our pharmaceutical wholesale segment see note 5 equity method investments to the consolidated financial statements included herein for further information due to the march 18 2016 effective date and the twomonth reporting lag our results for the 12 month period ended august 31 2016 include approximately three and a half months of equity method income relating to our investment in amerisourcebergen similarly due to the timing of the transaction and the two month reporting lag our results for the fiscal quarter ended november 30 2016 will include approximately five weeks of equity income reflecting our increased ownership following the exercise on august 25 2016 of the second tranche of warrants

 

restructuring programs 

on april 8 2015 the walgreens boots alliance board of directors approved a plan to implement a new restructuring program the “cost transformation program” as part of an initiative to reduce costs and increase operating efficiencies the cost transformation program implements and builds on the planned threeyear 10 billion costreduction initiative previously announced by walgreens on august 6 2014 and includes a number of elements designed to help achieve profitable growth through increased cost efficiencies we have identified additional opportunities for cost savings that increase the total expected cost savings of the cost transformation program by 500 million to a projected 15 billion by the end of fiscal 2017 significant areas of focus include plans to close approximately 200 stores across the us reorganize divisional and field operations drive operating efficiencies and streamline information technology and other functions the actions under the cost transformation program focus primarily on our retail pharmacy usa segment and are expected to be substantially completed by the end of fiscal 2017

 

 33  

as of the date of this report the company estimates that the cost transformation program will recognize cumulative pretax charges to our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america “gaap” of between 13 billion and 15 billion  which is 300 million lower than the previously estimated range of pretax charges at the time the cost transformation program was launched including costs associated with lease obligations and other real estate payments asset impairments and employee termination and other business transition and exit costs as of the date of this report we expect to incur pretax charges of between 425 million and 500 million for real estate costs including lease obligations net of estimated sublease income between 525 million and 575 million for asset impairment charges relating primarily to asset writeoffs from store closures information technology inventory and other nonoperational real estate asset writeoffs and between  350 million and  425 million for employee severance and other business transition and exit costs we estimate that approximately 60  of the cumulative pretax charges will result in cash expenditures over time  primarily related to historical and future lease and other real estate payments and employee separation costs see note 3 restructuring to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

the amounts and timing of all estimates are subject to change until finalized the actual amounts and timing may vary materially based on various factors see “cautionary note regarding forwardlooking statements” below

executive summary 

the following table presents certain key financial statistics for the company for fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014

walgreens boots alliance results of operations 

fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 

fiscal 2016 net earnings attributable to walgreens boots alliance decreased 11 percent to 42 billion while diluted net earnings per share decreased 45 percent to 382 compared with the prior year the decreases reflect fluctuations in the fair value adjustments of the company’s amerisourcebergen warrants and the prior year gain on the previously held equity interest in alliance boots which was largely offset by the inclusion of alliance boots consolidated results for the entire period and an increase in operating income at retail pharmacy usa

other income expense for fiscal 2016 was an expense of 261 million as compared to income of 685 million in fiscal 2015 the change in fair value of our amerisourcebergen warrants resulted in a loss of 546 million for fiscal 2016 as compared to income of 759 million for fiscal 2015 additionally we recognized income of 268 million for fiscal year ended 2016 related to the change in accounting method for our investment in amerisourcebergen 

 

interest was a net expense of 596 million and 605 million in fiscal 2016 and 2015 respectively fiscal 2016 included interest expense on notes issued during june 2016 fiscal 2015 included interest expense of 99 million related to the repayment of a portion of our longterm debt in advance of its maturity

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 and 2015 was 194 and 199 respectively the net decrease in the effective tax rate is attributable to several factors first our 2016 effective tax rate benefited from having a fullyear of foreign sourced pretax earnings taxed at lower rates as compared to 2015 when the company had only eight months of those earnings after the second step transaction further in 2016 our domestic pretax earnings were reduced as a result of the amerisourcebergen warrants then held by the company in addition during 2016 the company benefitted from enacted tax law changes tax rate reductions in multiple foreign tax jurisdictions most notably the united kingdom which generated a 178 million tax benefit the company also had fewer nondeductible expenses in 2016 as compared to 2015 these items were partly offset by the facts that in 2015 the company had a nontaxable gain on its previously held equity investment in alliance boots and recognized the benefit of a capital loss deferred tax asset neither of which recurred in 2016

walgreens boots alliance adjusted diluted net earnings per share nongaap measure 

adjusted net earnings attributable to walgreens boots alliance in fiscal 2016 increased 226 percent to 50 billion compared with the prior year adjusted diluted net earnings per share in the fiscal year increased 183 percent to 459 compared with the prior year the increase in adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted net earnings per share for fiscal 2016 was primarily attributable to inclusion of alliance boots consolidated results for the entire period and an increase in operating income at retail pharmacy usa see “nongaap measures” below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measure

 

fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 

our results for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 were primarily impacted by the second step transaction which resulted in the full consolidation of alliance boots results of operations beginning december 31 2014 for fiscal 2015 the full consolidation of alliance boots operations increased our sales by 294 gross profit by 229 selling general and administrative expenses by 231 and operating income by 185 each as compared to fiscal 2014 see “ comparability” above

 

 35  

net earnings attributable to walgreens boots alliance inc for fiscal 2015 were 42 billion or 400 per share on a diluted basis as compared to 19 billion or 200 per share on a diluted basis in fiscal 2014 the increase in diluted net earnings per share for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily attributable to the full consolidation of alliance boots operations from january through august 2015 a gain on our 45 previously held equity interest in alliance boots increased sales in our retail pharmacy usa division increased income from our warrants to acquire amerisourcebergen common stock and a lower effective income tax rate these increases were partially offset by lower retail pharmacy usa gross margins and a higher interest expense

as a result of acquiring the remaining 55 interest in alliance boots on december 31 2014 our previously held 45 interest was remeasured to fair value resulting in a gain of 563 million in fiscal 2015 the fair value of the previously held equity interest in alliance boots was determined using the income approach methodology the fair value measurement of the previously held equity interest is based on significant inputs not observable in the market the fair value estimates for the previously held equity interest are based on a projected discounted cash flows b historical and projected financial information and c synergies including cost savings as relevant that market participants would consider when estimating the fair value of the previously held equity interest in alliance boots see note 7 acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

other income expense for fiscal 2015 was income of 685 million as compared to expense of 481 million in fiscal 2014 the change in fair value of our amerisourcebergen warrants resulted in recording income of 759 million and 366 million in fiscal 2015 and 2014 respectively the increase in fair value was primarily attributed to the change in the price of amerisourcebergen’s common stock in addition we recorded 20 million and 19 million in fiscal 2015 and 2014 respectively of other income relating to the amortization of the deferred credit associated with the initial value of the walgreens warrants we have also recorded a loss of 94 million in fiscal 2015 on derivative contracts that were not designated as accounting hedges the losses primarily relate to foreign currency forward contracts entered into in consideration of the delivery of foreign cash consideration related to the second step transaction fiscal 2014 results also included a loss of 866 million related to the alliance boots call option upon the amendment and immediate exercise of the call option to acquire the remaining 55 ownership of alliance boots we were required to compare the fair value of the amended option with the book value of the original option the fair value of the amended option was estimated to be zero based on its valuation as a financial instrument without regard for its strategic value the reduction in value was primarily due to the shorter duration of the amended option and the appreciation since the original valuation in the price of walgreens stock used as partial consideration for the purchase of the remaining 55 ownership interest in alliance boots 

interest was a net expense of 605 million and 156 million in fiscal 2015 and 2014 respectively the increase in fiscal 2015 interest expense is primarily due to the notes we issued to fund a portion of the cash consideration payable in connection with the second step transaction and to subsequently refinance substantially all of alliance boots’ outstanding borrowings following completion of the second step transaction additionally in fiscal 2015 we repaid a portion of our longterm debt in advance of its maturity resulting in additional net interest expense of 99 million

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 and 2014 was 199 and 429 respectively the decrease in the fiscal 2015 effective tax rate as compared to fiscal 2014 is primarily attributable to recording discrete tax benefits related to previously unrecognized capital loss deferred tax assets as a result of recognizing capital gain income from fiscal 2015 and anticipated future period saleleaseback transactions in addition as a result of our acquisition of the remaining 55 interest in alliance boots that we did not previously own our annual effective tax rate decreased due to incremental foreign source income taxed at lower rates and additional favorable permanent booktax differences also as a result of the acquisition we recognized a nonrecurring tax benefit that also lowered our annual effective tax rate in addition we recognized other net discrete tax benefits in the current fiscal year

critical accounting policies 

the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and include amounts based on management’s prudent judgments and estimates actual results may differ from these estimates management believes that any reasonable deviation from those judgments and estimates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations to the extent that the estimates used differ from actual results however adjustments to the statement of earnings and corresponding balance sheet accounts would be necessary these adjustments would be made in future periods some of the more significant estimates include business combinations goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment vendor allowances liability for closed locations cost of sales and inventory equity method investments pension and postretirement benefits and income taxes we use the following methods to determine our estimates

 

business combinations – we account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that once control is obtained all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition the determination of fair values of assets and liabilities acquired requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available

for intangible assets we generally use the income approach to determine fair value the income approach requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions primarily include but are not limited to discount rates terminal growth rates royalty rates forecasts of revenue operating income depreciation amortization and capital expenditures the discount rates applied to the projections reflect the risk factors associated with those projections

 

 48  

although we believe our estimates of fair value are reasonable actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on the determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired

judgment is also required in determining the intangible asset’s useful life

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment – goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value as part of our impairment analysis for each reporting unit we determine fair value for each reporting unit this determination includes estimating the fair value using both the income and market approaches the income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit including projected future operating results economic projections anticipated future cash flows and discount rates the market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping

the determination of the fair value of the reporting units and the allocation of that value to individual assets and liabilities within those reporting units requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions primarily include but are not limited to the selection of appropriate peer group companies control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we compete discount rates terminal growth rates forecasts of revenue operating income depreciation amortization and capital expenditures the allocation requires analysis to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities including purchased prescription files customer relationships pharmacy licenses and trade names although we believe our estimates of fair value are reasonable actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units the amount of any goodwill impairment charge or both

we also compared the sum of the estimated fair values of the reporting units to the company’s fair value as implied by the market value of the company’s equity and debt securities this comparison indicated that in total our assumptions and estimates were reasonable however future declines in the overall market value of the company’s equity and debt securities may indicate that the fair value of one or more reporting units has declined below its carrying value

our reporting units’ fair values exceeded their carrying amounts ranging from approximately 17  to more than 116  see note 8 goodwill and other intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

 

indefinitelived intangible assets are tested by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value

our indefinitelived intangible asset fair value is estimated using the relief from royalty method and excess earnings method of the income approach these estimates can be affected by a number of factors including but not limited to general economic conditions availability of market information as well as our profitability

 

vendor allowances – vendor allowances are principally received as a result of purchases sales or promotion of vendors’ products allowances are generally recorded as a reduction of inventory and are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales when the related merchandise is sold those allowances received for promoting vendors’ products are offset against advertising expense and result in a reduction of selling general and administrative expenses to the extent of advertising incurred with the excess treated as a reduction of inventory costs  

liability for closed locations – the liability is based on the present value of future rent obligations and other related costs net of estimated sublease rent to the first lease option date  

 

 49  

cost of sales and inventory – cost of sales includes the purchase price of goods and services sold store and warehouse inventory loss inventory obsolescence manufacturing costs certain direct product design and development costs and supplier rebates in addition to product costs cost of sales includes manufacturing costs warehousing costs for retail operations purchasing costs freight costs cash discounts and vendor allowances cost of sales for our retail pharmacy usa segment is derived based upon pointofsale scanning information with an estimate for shrinkage and is adjusted based on periodic inventory counts inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market determined by the lastin firstout “lifo” method for the retail pharmacy usa segment and on a firstin firstout “fifo” basis for inventory in the retail pharmacy international and pharmaceutical wholesale segments except for retail inventory in the retail pharmacy international segment which is valued using the retail method 

 

equity method investments   – we use the equity method to account for investments in companies if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence but not control over operating and financial policies of the investee our proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies is included in consolidated net earnings judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as our ownership interest representation on the board of directors participation in policymaking decisions and material purchase and sale transactions  

pension and postretirement benefits – we have various defined benefit pension plans that cover some of our foreign employees we also have postretirement healthcare plans that cover qualifying domestic employees eligibility and the level of benefits for these plans varies depending on participants’ status date of hire and or length of service our pension and postretirement expenses and valuations are dependent on assumptions used by our actuaries in calculating those amounts these assumptions include discount rates healthcare cost trends longterm rate of return on plan assets retirement rates mortality rates and other factors in determining our longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption we consider both the historical performance of the investment portfolio as well as the longterm market return expectations based on the investment mix of the portfolio a change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on our projected benefit obligation and pension expense a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in a decline of 440 million to our pension benefit obligation a 25 basis point decrease on the expected return on plan assets assumption would increase our pension expense by 24 million

our policy is to fund our pension plans in accordance with applicable regulations our postretirement healthcare plans are not funded

 

income taxes – we are subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business us federal state local and foreign tax authorities raise questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions in evaluating the tax benefits associated with our various tax filing positions we record a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized adjustments are made to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which we determine the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities the statute of limitations expires for the return containing the tax position or when more information becomes available our liability for unrecognized tax benefits including accrued penalties and interest is primarily included in other longterm liabilities and current income taxes on our consolidated balance sheets and in income tax provision in our consolidated st atements of earnings  

in determining our provision for income taxes we use income permanent differences between book and tax income and enacted statutory income tax rates the provision for income taxes rate also reflects our assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits in addition to any foreignbased income deemed to be taxable in the united states discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

interest rate risk

we are exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to existing debt issuances primary exposures include libor and commercial paper rates from time to time we use interest rate derivative contracts including interest rate caps interest rate swaps and forwardstarting interest rate swaps to hedge our exposure to the impact of interest rate changes on existing debt and future debt issuances respectively to reduce the volatility of our financing costs and based on current and projected market conditions achieve a desired proportion of fixed versus floatingrate debt generally under these swaps we agree with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixedrate and floatingrate interest amounts based on an agreed upon notional principal amount

information regarding our transactions are set forth in note 10 financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements these financial instruments are sensitive to changes in interest rates on august 31 2016 we had approximately 19 billion in longterm debt obligations that had floating interest rates a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates on the various debt instruments we hold would increase or decrease the annual interest expense we recognize and the cash we pay for interest expense by approximately 19 million the amounts exclude the impact of any associated derivative contracts

walgreens boots alliance was incorporated in delaware in 2014 and as described below is the successor of walgreen co an illinois corporation “walgreens” which was formed in 1909 as a successor to a business founded in 1901 our principal executive offices are located at 108 wilmot road deerfield illinois 60015 our common stock trades on the nasdaq stock market under the symbol “wba”

recent transactions 

on august 2 2012 walgreens acquired a 45 equity interest in alliance boots gmbh “alliance boots” along with a call option to acquire the remaining 55 equity interest in alliance boots the “first step transaction” in exchange for 4025 billion in cash and approximately 834 million shares of walgreens common stock

on december 31 2014 walgreens boots alliance became the successor of walgreens pursuant to a merger to effect a reorganization of walgreens into a holding company structure the “reorganization” with walgreens boots alliance becoming the parent holding company pursuant to the reorganization walgreens became a whollyowned subsidiary of walgreens boots alliance which was formed for the purposes of the reorganization and each issued and outstanding share of walgreens common stock was converted into one share of walgreens boots alliance common stock also on december 31 2014 following the completion of the reorganization walgreens boots alliance completed the acquisition pursuant to the call option of the remaining 55 of alliance boots that walgreens did not previously own the “second step transaction” in exchange for £3133 billion 4874 billion in cash and 1443 million shares of walgreens boots alliance common stock

prior to the completion of the second step transaction we accounted for our 45 investment in alliance boots using the equity method of accounting investments accounted for under the equity method are recorded initially at cost and subsequently adjusted for our share of the net income or loss and cash contributions and distributions to or from these entities net income reported by alliance boots during this period was translated from british pounds sterling at the average rate for the period upon completion of the second step transaction alliance boots became a consolidated subsidiary and ceased being accounted for under the equity method for financial reporting and accounting purposes walgreens boots alliance was the acquirer of alliance boots the consolidated financial statements and other data such as prescriptions filled reflect the results of operations and financial position of walgreens and its subsidiaries for periods prior to december 31 2014 and of walgreens boots alliance and its subsidiaries for periods as of and after the closing of the reorganization on december 31 2014 for additional information see “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” “mda” in part ii item 7 below and note 6 equity method investments to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 below

industry overview 

the global retail pharmacy and pharmaceutical wholesale industries are highly competitive and have been experiencing consolidation in recent years prescription drugs play a significant role in healthcare and constitute a first line of treatment for many medical conditions we believe the longterm outlook for prescription drug utilization is strong due in part to aging populations increases in life expectancy increases in the availability and utilization of generic drugs the continued development of innovative drugs that improve quality of life and control healthcare costs and increases in the number of persons with insurance coverage for prescription drugs including in the united states the expansion of healthcare insurance coverage under the patient protection and affordable care act the “aca” and “baby boomers” increasingly becoming eligible for the federally funded medicare part d prescription program wholesalers in the pharmaceutical distribution business function as a vital link between drug manufacturers and pharmacies and healthcare providers in supplying pharmaceuticals to patients 

the global retail pharmacy industry relies significantly on private and governmental third party payers many private organizations throughout the healthcare industry including pharmacy benefit management “pbm” companies and health insurance companies have consolidated in recent years to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater bargaining power third party payers including the medicare part d plans and the statesponsored medicaid and related managed care medicaid agencies in the united states can change eligibility requirements or reduce certain reimbursement rates in addition in many european countries the government provides or subsidizes healthcare to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices patient eligibility and reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored healthcare system changes in law or regulation also can impact reimbursement rates and terms for example the aca seeks to reduce federal spending by altering the medicaid reimbursement formula “amp” for multisource drugs and when implemented is expected to reduce medicaid reimbursements state medicaid programs are also expected to continue to seek reductions in reimbursements independent of amp when third party payers or governmental authorities take actions that restrict eligibility or reduce prices or reimbursement rates sales and margins in the retail pharmacy industry could be reduced which would adversely affect industry profitability in some cases these possible adverse effects may be partially or entirely offset by controlling inventory costs and other expenses dispensing more higher margin generics finding new revenue streams through pharmacy services or other offerings andor dispensing a greater volume of prescriptions

generic prescription drugs have continued to help lower overall costs for customers and third party payers we expect the utilization of generic pharmaceuticals to continue to increase in general in the united states generic versions of drugs generate lower total sales dollars per prescription but higher gross profit margins and gross profit dollars as compared with patentprotected brand name drugs the positive impact on retail pharmacy gross profit margins and gross profit dollars can be significant in the first several months after a generic version of a drug is first allowed to compete with the branded version which is generally referred to as a “generic conversion” in any given year the number of major brand name drugs that undergo a conversion from branded to generic status can vary and the timing of generic conversions can be difficult to predict which can have a significant impact on retail pharmacy sales gross profit margins and gross profit dollars 

we expect that market demand government regulation thirdparty reimbursement policies government contracting requirements and other pressures will continue to cause the industries in which we compete to evolve pharmacists are on the frontlines of the healthcare delivery system and we believe rising healthcare costs and the limited supply of primary care physicians present new opportunities for pharmacists and retail pharmacies to play an even greater role in driving positive outcomes for patients and payers through expanded service offerings such as immunizations and other preventive care healthcare clinics pharmacistled medication therapy management and chronic condition management

 

 2 

segments 

prior to december 31 2014 walgreens’ operations were reported within one reportable segment following the completion of the reorganization and the second step transaction we organized our operations to reflect our new structure our operations are now organized into three divisions which are also our reportable segments

 

 

 

 

for fiscal 2015 our segment total sales were retail pharmacy usa 810 billion retail pharmacy international 88 billion and pharmaceutical wholesale 153 billion due to the timing of completion of the second step transaction retail pharmacy international and pharmaceutical wholesale total sales reflect operations for the last eight months of our fiscal year additional information relating to our segments is included in mda in part ii item 7 below and in note 19 segment reporting to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 below which information is incorporated herein by reference

 

retail pharmacy usa

our retail pharmacy usa division has pharmacyled health and beauty retail businesses in 50 states the district of colombia puerto rico and the us virgin islands each focused on helping people feel healthy and happy we operated 8173 retail stores in the division as of august 31 2015 our principal retail pharmacy brands in the division are walgreens and duane reade we are a market leader in the united states and as of august 31 2015 approximately 76 of the population of the united states lived within five miles of a walgreens or duane reade retail pharmacy

we provide customers with convenient omnichannel access to consumer goods and services including own branded general merchandise such as nice delish tm and well at walgreens as well as pharmacy and health and wellness services in communities across america our websites receive an average of approximately 68 million visits per month integrated with our ecommerce platform the walgreens mobile application allows customers to refill prescriptions through scan technology receive text messages alerting when a refill is due and other retail functionality such as photo and shopping features

our services help improve health outcomes for patients and manage costs for payers including employers managed care organizations health systems pbm companies and the public sector we utilize our retail network as a channel to provide health and wellness services to our customers and patients as illustrated by our ability to play a significant role in providing flu vaccines and other immunizations we also provide specialty pharmacy services and manage instore clinics branded as “healthcare clinic” with more than 400 locations throughout the united states as of august 31 2015 we have more than 74000 healthcare service providers including pharmacists pharmacy technicians nurse practitioners and other health related professionals

the components of the division’s sales are pharmacy the sale of prescription drugs and provision of pharmacyrelated services and retail the sale of healthcare and retail products including nonprescription drugs beauty toiletries and general merchandise the division’s sales are subject to the influence of seasonality particularly the winter holiday and cough cold and flu seasons this seasonality also can affect the division’s proportion of sales between retail and pharmacy during certain periods the components of the division’s fiscal year total sales were as follows

 

we filled approximately 723 million prescriptions including immunizations in the division in fiscal 2015 adjusted to 30day equivalents prescriptions filled were 894 million in fiscal 2015 sales where reimbursement is received from managed care organizations governmental agencies pbm companies and private insurance were 968 of the division’s fiscal 2015 pharmacy sales

we fill prescriptions for many state medicaid public assistance programs revenues from all such medicaid plans were approximately 45 of the division’s fiscal 2015 total sales revenues from medicare part d plans were approximately 159 of the division’s fiscal 2015 total sales 

 

 3 

our us loyalty program balance® rewards is designed to reward our most valuable customers and encourage shopping in stores and online balance rewards members receive special pricing on select products and earn everyday rewards points for purchasing most merchandise that can be instantly redeemed at our stores or through walgreenscom as of august 31 2015 the number of active balance rewards members totaled approximately 85 million for this purpose we define an active member as someone who has used their card in the last six months

amerisourcebergen began to supply and distribute all branded pharmaceutical products that we historically sourced from distributors and suppliers to the division’s retail stores as of september 1 2013 and during calendar 2014 it began to supply and distribute increasingly significant levels of generic pharmaceutical products that in the past we selfdistributed this transition to amerisourcebergen was substantially complete as of august 31 2014 we purchase our nonpharmaceutical merchandise from numerous manufacturers and wholesalers

our sales gross profit margin and gross profit dollars are impacted by among other things both the percentage of prescriptions that we fill that are generic and the rate at which new generic drugs are introduced to the market because any number of factors outside of our control can affect timing for a generic conversion we face substantial uncertainty in predicting when such conversions will occur and what effect they will have on particular future periods

the current environment of our pharmacy business also includes ongoing generic inflation reimbursement pressure and a shift in pharmacy mix towards 90day at retail one prescription that is the equivalent of three 30day prescriptions in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015 we experienced cost increases on a subset of generic drugs that historically experienced deflation some of which were significant we expect this generic inflation to continue into fiscal 2016

we continuously face reimbursement pressure from pbm companies health maintenance organizations managed care organizations and other commercial third party payers our agreements with these payers are regularly subject to expiration termination or renegotiation in addition plan changes with rate adjustments often occur in january and our reimbursement arrangements may provide for rate adjustments at prescribed intervals during their term we experienced lower reimbursement rates in fiscal 2015 as compared to the same period in the prior year further we accepted lower medicare part d reimbursement rates in calendar 2015 compared to calendar 2014 in order to secure preferred relationships with medicare part d plans serving senior patients with significant pharmacy needs 

our 90day at retail prescription drug offering is typically at a lower margin than comparable 30day prescriptions but provides us with the opportunity to increase business with patients with chronic prescription needs while offering increased convenience helping facilitate improved prescription adherence and resulting in a lower cost to fill the 90day prescription we expect that these factors will continue to have an adverse impact on gross profit dollar growth in our pharmacy business in fiscal 2016

retail pharmacy international

our retail pharmacy international division excluding equity method investments has pharmacyled health and beauty retail businesses in eight countries each focused on helping people look and feel their best we operated 4582 retail stores in this division as of august 31 2015 see “properties” in part i item 2 below for information regarding geographic coverage and have grown our online presence significantly in recent years our principal retail pharmacy brands are boots in the united kingdom thailand norway the republic of ireland and the netherlands and benavides in mexico and ahumada in chile in europe we are a market leader and our retail stores are conveniently located and our pharmacists are well placed to provide a significant role in the provision of healthcare services working closely with other primary healthcare providers in the communities we serve

the boots omnichannel offering is differentiated from that of competitors due to the product brands we own such as no7 boots pharmaceuticals botanics liz earle soap  glory and ‘only at boots’ exclusive products together with our long established reputation for trust and customer care our brands portfolio is enhanced by our inhouse product research and development and manufacturing capabilities

our retail store networks are typically complemented by online platforms in the united kingdom our transactional website bootscom and our consumer health and wellness portal bootswebmdcom continued to be two of the most visited health websites receiving on average approximately 19 million and 11 million visits monthly through the bootscom website and integrated mobile application our ‘order and collect’ service allows customers to order from a range of over 30000 products by 800 pm and collect by noon the following day from approximately 90 of the united kingdom’s retail stores as of august 31 2015

the boots advantage card loyalty program where customers earn points on purchases for redemption at a later date continues to be a key element of the boots offering as of august 31 2015 the number of active boots advantage card members totaled approximately 16 million for this purpose we define an active member as someone who has used their card in the last six months

in addition boots in the united kingdom is one of the leaders in the optical market with 637 practices of which 177 operated on a franchise basis as of august 31 2015 approximately 30 of these optical practices are located in boots stores with the balance being standalone optical practices

the components of the division’s sales are pharmacy typically the sale of prescription drugs and provision of pharmacyrelated services subject to variation in particular jurisdictions depending upon regulatory and other factors and retail primarily the sale of health and beauty products including beauty toiletries and lifestyle merchandising nonprescription drugs and in the united kingdom the provision of optical services

the division’s sales are subject to the influence of seasonality with the second fiscal quarter typically the strongest as a result of the winter holiday period this seasonality affects the division’s proportion of sales between retail and pharmacy during certain periods subsequent to the second step transaction for the months of january through august 2015 pharmacy and retail sales represented 37 and 63 of total division sales respectively

the division’s retail sales gross profit margin and gross profit dollars are impacted by among other things the highly competitive nature of the health and beauty category specifically our and our competitors pricing actions promotional offers and events and our customer’s desire for value and convenience

the division’s pharmacy sales gross margin and gross profit dollars are impacted by governmental agencies and other third party payers seeking to minimize increases in the costs of healthcare including pharmaceutical drug reimbursement rates in the united kingdom our largest market for pharmacy sales in the division the amount of government funding available for pharmacy services is reviewed and agreed with the pharmacy industry on an annual basis has been broadly unchanged for the last two years

in addition performance as measured in us dollars is impacted by the exchange rates used to translate these amounts into us dollars the exchange rate of british pounds sterling being the most significant

pharmaceutical wholesale

our pharmaceutical wholesale division excluding equity method investments which mainly operates under the alliance healthcare brand supplies medicines other healthcare products and related services to more than 140000 pharmacies doctors health centers and hospitals each year from 302 distribution centers in 12 countries primarily in europe as of august 31 2015

the distribution of prescription medicines to pharmacists comprises the vast majority of the division’s sales our wholesale businesses seek to provide high core service levels to pharmacists in terms of frequency of delivery product availability delivery accuracy timeliness and reliability at competitive prices we also offer customers innovative addedvalue services to help pharmacists develop their own businesses this includes membership of alphega pharmacy our paneuropean network for independent pharmacies which as of august 31 2015 had over 6500 members

in addition to the wholesale of medicines and other healthcare products our businesses provide services to pharmaceutical manufacturers who are increasingly seeking to gain greater control over their product distribution while at the same time outsourcing noncore activities these services include prewholesale and contract logistics mainly under the alloga brand direct deliveries to pharmacies and innovative and specialized healthcare services covering clinical homecare medicine support dispensing services medicine preparation and clinical trial support mainly under the alcura brand

combined with local engagement scale is important in pharmaceutical wholesaling we are one of the largest pharmaceutical wholesalers and distributors in europe and we rank as one of the top three in market share in many of the individual countries in which we operate

 

our sales gross profit margin and gross profit dollars are impacted by among other things government actions which typically seek to reduce the growth in prescription drug consumption reduce reimbursement rates and increase generic drug utilization a greater proportion of generic drugs whether as a result of government actions generic conversions or other factors typically has an adverse effect on our revenues however in the wholesale division we typically earn equal or better gross margins on generic drugs than on branded drugs although there are exceptions 

 

 5 

changes in manufacturers’ product distribution business models also can impact the division’s sales and gross margin for example when pharmaceutical drug manufacturers introduce feeforservice contracts it reduces our sales even if we are successful in winning these contracts as we only recognize sales in the amount of the fees charged other manufacturer services including our prewholesale and contract logistics operations are typically on a feeforservice basis

in addition performance as measured in us dollars is impacted by the exchange rates used to translate these amounts into us dollars the exchange rate of british pounds sterling and the euro being the most significant the division’s sales are subject to less seasonality than our other divisions

intellectual property and licenses 

we market products and services under various trademarks trade dress and trade names and rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark service mark and trade secret laws as well as contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights we own numerous domain names hold numerous patents have registered numerous trademarks and have filed applications for the registration of a number of our other trademarks and service marks in various jurisdictions we hold assorted business licenses such as pharmacy occupational liquor and cigarette having various lives within multiple legal jurisdictions which are necessary for the normal operation of our business

seasonal variations in business 

our business is affected by a number of factors including among others our sales performance during holiday periods including particularly the winter holiday season and during the cough cold and flu season the timing and severity of which is difficult to predict significant weather conditions the timing of our own or competitor discount programs and pricing actions and the timing of changes in levels of reimbursement from governmental agencies and other third party payers see “summary of quarterly results unaudited” in the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 below

sources and availability of raw materials 

inventories are purchased from numerous domestic and foreign suppliers we do not believe that the loss of any one supplier or group of suppliers under common control would have a material adverse effect on our business or that of any of our divisions

working capital practices 

effective inventory management is important to our operations we use various inventory management techniques including demand forecasting and planning and various forms of replenishment management our working capital needs typically are greater in the months leading up to the winter holiday season we generally finance our inventory and expansion needs with internally generated funds and shortterm borrowings for additional information see the liquidity and capital resources section in mda in part ii item 7 below

customers

 item 1a risk factors 

 

in addition to the other information in this report and our other filings with the sec you should carefully consider the risks described below which could materially and adversely affect our business operations financial condition and results of operations these risks are not the only risks that we face our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial

 

reductions in third party reimbursement levels from private or governmental agency plans and potential changes in industry pricing benchmarks for prescription drugs could adversely affect our results of operations

 

the substantial majority of the prescriptions we fill are reimbursed by third party payers including private and governmental agency payers the continued efforts of health maintenance organizations managed care organizations pharmacy benefit management companies governmental agencies and other third party payers to reduce prescription drug costs and pharmacy reimbursement rates as well as litigation relating to how drugs are priced may adversely impact our results of operations in the united states plan changes with rate adjustments often occur in january and our reimbursement arrangements may provide for rate adjustments at prescribed intervals during their term in addition some of these entities may offer pricing terms that we may not be willing to accept or otherwise restrict our participation in their networks of pharmacy providers

in the united states certain provisions of the deficit reduction act of 2005 sought to reduce federal spending by altering amp the medicaid reimbursement formula for multisource ie generic drugs while those reductions did not go into effect the aca which was signed into law on march 23 2010 enacted a modified amp reimbursement formula for multisource drugs that significantly affects reimbursement calculations the modified formula when implemented is expected to reduce medicaid reimbursements which could adversely affect our results of operations the centers for medicare and medicaid services “cms” is preparing to use the modified reimbursement formula to calculate a us federal ceiling on reimbursement rates for multisource drugs to pharmacies under the medicaid program and posts draft federal upper limit “ful” reimbursement files on the cms website that are calculated based on the requirements of the health reform legislation as of the date of this report these draft ful files are for review and comment only however cms has announced that it plans to publish final fuls after a period of releasing them in draft format cms has issued proposed regulations to implement the aca’s provisions regarding medicaid reimbursement to pharmacies but to date the regulations have not been finalized there have also been a number of other proposals and enactments by the federal government and various states to reduce medicare part d and medicaid reimbursement levels in response to budget deficits and we expect additional proposals in the future

 

many payers in the united states are increasingly considering new metrics as the basis for reimbursement rates such as average sales price average manufacturer price and actual acquisition cost for example cms now makes national average drug acquisition cost data which reflect retail community pharmacy invoice costs publicly available on a regular basis cms has indicated that state medicaid agencies can use this information to compare their own reimbursement and pricing methodologies and rates to those derived from the survey data there can be no assurance that recent or future changes in prescription drug reimbursement policies and practices will not materially and adversely affect our results of operations

 

a shift in pharmacy mix toward lower margin plans and programs could adversely affect our results of operations

 

a shift in the mix of pharmacy prescription volume towards programs offering lower reimbursement rates could adversely affect our results of operations our retail pharmacy usa division continued to experience a shift in pharmacy mix towards 90day at retail in fiscal 2015 and that trend is expected to continue in fiscal 2016 our 90day at retail offering for patients with chronic prescription needs typically is at a lower margin than comparable 30day prescriptions additionally we have accepted lower reimbursement rates in order to secure preferred relationships with medicare part d plans serving senior patients with significant pharmacy needs if we are not able to generate additional prescription volume and other business from patients participating in these programs that is sufficient to offset the impact of lower reimbursement our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected

 

we could be adversely affected by a decrease in the introduction of new brand name and generic prescription drugs

 

new brand name drugs can result in increased drug utilization and associated sales revenues while the introduction of lower priced generic alternatives typically results in relatively lower sales revenues but higher gross profit margins accordingly a decrease in the number of significant new brand name drugs or generics successfully introduced could materially and adversely affect our results of operations

 

generic drug inflation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the united states

 

overall increases in the amounts we pay to procure generic drugs commonly referred to as generic drug inflation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including particularly those of our retail pharmacy usa division our gross profit margins would be adversely affected by generic inflation to the extent we are not able to offset such cost increases we experienced a shift from historical patterns of deflation in generic drug costs to inflation in fiscal 2014 when we experienced cost increases on a subset of generic drugs that in some cases were significant this generic inflation continued with respect to certain generic drugs in fiscal 2015 any failure to fully offset any such increased prices and costs or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations

we derive a significant portion of our sales in the united states from prescription drug sales reimbursed by pharmacy benefit management companies

 

we derive a significant portion of our sales in the united states from prescription drug sales reimbursed through prescription drug plans administered by pbm companies pbm companies typically administer multiple prescription drug plans that expire at various times and provide for varying reimbursement rates and often limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list known as a formulary which might not include all of the approved drugs for a particular indication there can be no assurance that we will continue to participate in any particular pbm company’s pharmacy provider network in any particular future time period if our participation in the pharmacy provider network for a prescription drug plan administered by one or more of the large pbm companies is restricted or terminated we expect that our sales would be adversely affected at least in the shortterm if we are unable to replace any such lost sales either through an increase in other sales or through a resumption of participation in those plans our operating results could be materially and adversely affected if we exit a pharmacy provider network and later resume participation there can be no assurance that we will achieve any particular level of business on any particular pace or that all clients of the pbm company will choose to include us again in the pharmacy network for their plans initially or at all in addition in such circumstances we may incur increased marketing and other costs in connection with initiatives to regain former patients and attract new patients covered by such plans

 

consolidation and strategic alliances in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business operations competitive positioning financial condition and results of operations

 

many organizations in the healthcare industry including pbm companies and health insurance companies have consolidated in recent years to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater bargaining power which has resulted in greater pricing pressures for example in july 2015 optumrx unitedhealth group’s pharmacy care services business completed its combination with catamaran corporation with the combined businesses expected to fulfill over one billion prescriptions in 2015 and be the third largest pbm company in the united states in addition significant business combinations within the health insurance industry were announced in july 2015 with anthem inc announcing its agreement to acquire cigna corporation and aetna inc announcing its agreement to acquire humana inc with the resulting enterprises expected to be two of the three largest health insurers in the united states if this consolidation trend continues it could give the resulting enterprises even greater bargaining power which may lead to further pressure on the prices for our products and services if these pressures result in reductions in our prices our businesses would become less profitable unless we are able to achieve corresponding reductions in costs

 

strategic alliances in the healthcare industry also impact our businesses and competitive positioning for example following the announcement of our agreement with amerisourcebergen providing for among other things generic drug purchasing by walgreens alliance boots and amerisourcebergen through wbad our global sourcing enterprise some of our retail pharmacy competitors subsequently established relationships with other pharmaceutical drug wholesalers relating to generic drug procurement in addition further consolidation among generic drug manufacturers could lead to increased generic drug inflation in the future we expect that market demand government regulation thirdparty reimbursement policies government contracting requirements and other pressures will continue to cause the healthcare industry to evolve potentially resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among the industry participants we engage with and which may materially and adversely impact our business operations financial condition and results of operations

 

we may not be able to successfully or timely complete the pending acquisition of rite aid

risks and uncertainties related to our pending acquisition of rite aid include among others the occurrence of any event change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement including the failure of rite aid to obtain the approval of its stockholders of the transaction that regulatory or other approvals required for the transaction are not obtained that litigation may be filed which could prevent or delay the transaction and that uncertainty regarding the transaction may adversely affect our and rite aids relationships with suppliers payers customers and other third parties with which we or rite aid do business 

completion of the transaction is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the merger agreement including the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods and any extensions thereof under the hartscott rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 as amended approval of the transaction by rite aid stockholders no material adverse effect having occurred with respect to rite aid prior to the closing of the transaction and other customary conditions we will be unable to complete the pending acquisition of rite aid until each of the conditions to closing is either satisfied or waived in deciding whether or not to object to the transaction regulatory agencies have broad discretion in administering the applicable governing regulations as a condition to their approval of the transaction these agencies may impose requirements limitations or costs or require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of our business after consummation of the transaction these requirements limitations costs divestitures or restrictions may reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction or affect our results of operations after the closing of the transaction further we can provide no assurance that we will obtain the necessary approvals or that any such conditions that are imposed would not diminish the anticipated benefits of the transaction or result in the termination of the transaction in the event that the transaction is not completed due to the failure to obtain antitrust clearance we could be required to pay rite aid a termination fee of 325 million or 650 million in certain circumstances 

 

while our acquisition of rite aid is pending it creates uncertainty that may adversely affect our business and results of operations including with respect to our relationships with suppliers payers customers and other third parties with which we do business further we have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the pending transaction as well as the diversion of management resources for which we will receive little or no benefit if the closing of the transaction does not occur

if we complete our pending acquisition of rite aid we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction which could adversely impact our results of operations

we entered into the merger agreement with the expectation that the transaction will result in various benefits including among other things cost savings and operating efficiencies the achievement of the anticipated benefits of the transaction is subject to a number of uncertainties including whether rite aids business can be integrated into ours in an efficient and effective manner if the rite aid transaction is completed we can provide no assurance that the anticipated benefits of the transaction  including cost savings and synergies will be fully realized in the time frame anticipated or at all the costs or difficulties related to the integration of rite aids business and operations into ours will not be greater than expected unanticipated costs charges and expenses will not result from the transaction litigation relating to the transaction will not be filed we will be able to retain key personnel and the transaction will not cause disruption to the parties business and operations and relationships with employees and suppliers payers customers and other third parties with which we do business if one or more of these risks are realized it could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 

 

the anticipated strategic and financial benefits of our acquisition of alliance boots may not be realized

 

walgreens and alliance boots entered into the purchase and option agreement dated june 18 2012 as amended on august 5 2014 as amended the “purchase and option agreement” and consummated the first and second step transactions contemplated thereby with the expectation that the transactions would result in various benefits including among other things procurement cost savings and operating efficiencies revenue synergies increased innovation sharing of best practices and a strengthened market position that may serve as a platform for future growth the processes and initiatives needed to achieve these potential benefits are complex costly and time consuming and we have not previously completed a transaction comparable in size or scope many of the expenses that will be incurred by their nature are difficult to estimate accurately achieving the expected benefits of the alliance boots transaction is subject to a number of significant challenges and uncertainties including without limitation whether unique corporate cultures will work collaboratively in an efficient and effective manner the coordination of geographically separate organizations the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding potential synergies and the integration process unforeseen expenses or delays and competitive factors in the marketplace

 

prior to the alliance boots acquisition on december 31 2014 alliance boots was a privatelyheld company and was not subject to the information and reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended and other federal securities laws and the compliance obligations of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 compliance with these new obligations as a result of alliance boots becoming a part of a public company has required and may continue to require significant resources and management attention and any failure to comply could have a material adverse effect on us in addition some current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their roles within the combined company which may adversely affect our ability to retain or recruit key managers and other employees we could also encounter unforeseen transaction and integrationrelated costs or other circumstances such as unforeseen liabilities or other issues existing or arising with respect to the business of alliance boots or otherwise resulting from the transaction many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs decreased revenue decreased synergies and the diversion of management time and attention if we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame or at all the expected benefits may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations financial condition and results of operations in addition we have incurred significant transaction costs related to the acquisition and have incurred and will continue to incur integration and related costs as we integrate the alliance boots businesses these integration and acquisitionrelated costs including legal accounting financial and tax advisory and other fees and costs may be higher than expected and some of these costs may be material

our operations outside of the united states subject us to a number of operating economic political regulatory and other international business risks

 

together with our equity method investments we had a presence in over 25 countries as of august 31 2015 the strategic combination with alliance boots in december 2014 greatly increased the importance of international business to our operations growth and prospects as historically substantially all of walgreens’ business operations had been conducted within the united states and its territories a substantial portion of alliance boots’ revenues are generated in the european union and neighboring countries and substantially all of alliance boots’ revenues are generated outside the united states our international business operations are subject to a number of risks including

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these factors can also adversely affect our payers vendors and customers in international markets which in turn can negatively impact our businesses we cannot assure you that one or more of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations results of operation or financial condition

 

our significant operations outside of the united states also expose us to currency exchange rate fluctuations and related risks including transaction currency exposures relating to the import and export of goods in currencies other than businesses’ functional currencies as well as currency translation exposures relating to profits and net assets denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we present our financial statements in us dollars and since the completion of the strategic combination with alliance boots in december 2014 have had a significant proportion of net assets and income in nonus dollar currencies primarily british pounds sterling and the euro as well as a range of emerging market currencies our results of operations and capital ratios can therefore be sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future results of operations in addition fluctuations in currencies relative to the us dollar may make it more difficult to perform periodtoperiod comparisons of our reported results of operations a depreciation of nonus dollar currencies relative to the us dollar could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations

 

 10 

we may from time to time in some instances enter into foreign currency contracts or other derivative instruments intended to hedge a portion of our foreign currency fluctuation risks which subjects us to additional risks such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations to us additionally we may and currently do use foreign currency borrowings to hedge some of our foreign currency fluctuation risks the periodic use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place we cannot assure you that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates including particularly the strengthening of the us dollar against major currencies or the currencies of large developing countries will not materially affect our consolidated financial results

 

our business results depend on our ability to successfully manage ongoing organizational change and achieve cost savings initiatives

 

in april 2015 our board of directors approved a plan to implement the cost transformation program described in mda in part ii item 7 below as part of an initiative to reduce costs and increase operating efficiencies there can be no assurance that we will realize in full or in part the anticipated benefits of this program our financial goals assume a level of productivity improvement including those reflected in our cost transformation program and other business optimization initiatives if we are unable to deliver these expected productivity improvements while continuing to invest in business growth our financial results could be adversely impacted our ability to successfully manage and execute these initiatives and realize expected savings and benefits in the amounts and at the times anticipated is important to our business success any failure to do so which could result from our inability to successfully execute plans changes in global or regional economic conditions competition changes in the industries in which we compete unanticipated costs or charges loss of key personnel and other factors described herein could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition and results of operations

 

disruption in our global supply chain could negatively impact our businesses

 

the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors and any future disruption in our supply chain or inability to find qualified vendors and access products that meet requisite quality and safety standards in a timely and efficient manner could adversely impact our businesses the loss or disruption of such supply arrangements for any reason including for issues such as labor disputes loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites inability to procure sufficient raw materials quality control issues ethical sourcing issues the supplier’s financial distress natural disasters civil unrest or acts of war or terrorism or other external factors over which we have no control could interrupt product supply and if not effectively managed and remedied have a material adverse impact on our business operations financial condition and results of operations

 

we use a single wholesaler of branded and generic pharmaceutical drugs as our primary source of such products for our retail pharmacy usa division

 

on march 19 2013 walgreens alliance boots and amerisourcebergen announced various agreements and arrangements including a tenyear pharmaceutical distribution agreement between walgreens and amerisourcebergen pursuant to which walgreens sources branded and generic pharmaceutical products from amerisourcebergen an agreement which provides amerisourcebergen the ability to access generics and related pharmaceutical products through wbad a global sourcing enterprise established by walgreens and alliance boots and agreements and arrangements pursuant to which we have the right but not the obligation to purchase a minority equity position in amerisourcebergen and gain associated representation on amerisourcebergen’s board of directors in certain circumstances as of the date of this report amerisourcebergen distributes for our retail pharmacy usa division all branded pharmaceutical products that walgreens historically sourced from suppliers and distributors as well as substantially all generic pharmaceutical products that walgreens previously selfdistributed consequently our business in the united states may be adversely affected by any operational financial or regulatory difficulties that amerisourcebergen experiences for example if amerisourcebergen’s operations are seriously disrupted for any reason whether due to a natural disaster labor disruption regulatory action computer or operational systems or otherwise it could adversely affect our business in the united states and our results of operations

 

our distribution agreement with amerisourcebergen is subject to early termination in certain circumstances and upon the expiration or termination of the agreement there can be no assurance that we or amerisourcebergen will be willing to renew the agreement or enter into a new agreement on terms favorable to us or at all if such expiration or termination occurred we believe that alternative sources of supply for most generic and brandname pharmaceuticals are readily available and that we could obtain and qualify alternative sources which may include resuming selfdistribution in some cases for substantially all of the prescription drugs we sell on an acceptable basis such that the impact of any expiration or termination would be temporary however there can be no assurance we would be able to engage alternative supply sources or implement selfdistribution processes on a timely basis or on terms favorable to us or effectively manage these transitions any of which could adversely affect our business operations financial condition and results of operations

 

 11 

the anticipated strategic and financial benefits of our relationship with amerisourcebergen may not be realized

 

walgreens entered into the arrangement with amerisourcebergen and alliance boots with the expectation that the transactions contemplated thereby would result in various benefits including among other things procurement cost savings and operating efficiencies innovation and sharing of best practices the processes and initiatives needed to achieve these potential benefits are complex costly and timeconsuming many of the anticipated synergies and expenses that will be incurred by their nature are difficult to estimate accurately at the present time achieving the anticipated benefits from the arrangement is subject to a number of significant challenges and uncertainties including the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations processes or initiatives or the inability to realize andor delays in realizing potential benefits and synergies whether unique corporate cultures of separate organizations will work collaboratively in an efficient and effective manner unforeseen expenses or delays and competitive factors in the marketplace

 

in addition we have the right but not the obligation under the transactions contemplated by the framework agreement dated as of march 18 2013 by and among the company alliance boots and amerisourcebergen the “framework agreement” to invest in the equity of amerisourcebergen there can be no assurance that we will complete any specific level of such potential equity investments in amerisourcebergen or exercise our warrants to acquire amerisourcebergen common stock when they are exercisable or that if completed that such investments will ultimately be profitable if such investments are completed and the price of amerisourcebergen common stock subsequently declines substantially we could experience a loss on or impairment of such investment which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we could also encounter unforeseen costs circumstances or issues existing or arising with respect to the transactions and collaboration we anticipate resulting from the framework agreement many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs decreased revenue decreased synergies and the diversion of management time and attention if we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame or at all the expected benefits may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations financial condition and results of operations

 

from time to time we make investments in companies over which we do not have sole control including our investment in amerisourcebergen some of these companies may operate in sectors that differ from our current operations and have different risks

 

from time to time we make debt or equity investments in other companies that we may not control or over which we may not have sole control for example while we beneficially own approximately 5 of the outstanding common stock and have a designee serving on the board of directors of amerisourcebergen we do not and will not have the ability to control daytoday operations of that company although the businesses in which we have made noncontrolling investments often have a significant health and daily living or prescription drug component some of them operate in businesses that are different from our primary lines of business andor operate in different geographic markets than we do investments in these businesses among other risks subject us to the operating and financial risks of the businesses we invest in and to the risk that we do not have sole control over the operations of these businesses

 

from time to time we may make additional investments in or acquire other entities that may subject us to similar risks the completion of the second step transaction increased our and our stockholders’ effective interest in certain equity method investments and other investments of alliance boots over which alliance boots does not exercise control we rely on the internal controls and financial reporting controls of these entities and their failure to maintain effectiveness or comply with applicable standards may materially and adversely affect us investments in entities over which we do not have sole control including joint ventures and strategic alliances present additional risks such as having differing objectives from our partners or the entities in which we are invested becoming involved in disputes or competing with those persons

 

changes in economic conditions could adversely affect consumer buying practices

 

our performance has been and may continue to be adversely impacted by changes in global national regional or local economic conditions and consumer confidence these conditions can also adversely affect our key vendors and customers external factors that affect consumer confidence and over which we exercise no influence include unemployment rates levels of personal disposable income and global national regional or local economic conditions as well as acts of war or terrorism changes in economic conditions and consumer confidence could adversely affect consumer preferences purchasing power and spending patterns which could lead to a decrease in overall consumer spending in addition reduced or flat consumer spending may drive us and our competitors to offer additional products at promotional prices all of these factors could materially and adversely impact our business operations financial condition and results of operations

 

 12 

european economic conditions together with austerity measures being taken by certain european governments could adversely affect us

 

the acquisition of alliance boots significantly increased our assets and operations within europe and accordingly our exposure to economic conditions in europe a further slowdown within the european economy could affect our businesses in europe by reducing the prices our customers may be able or willing to pay for our products and services or by reducing the demand for our products and services either of which could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations in addition in many european countries the government provides or subsidizes healthcare to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices patient eligibility and reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored healthcare system in recent years in response to the economic environment and financial crisis in europe a number of european governments have announced or implemented austerity measures to reduce healthcare spending and constrain overall government expenditures these measures which include efforts aimed at reforming healthcare coverage and reducing healthcare costs continue to exert pressure on the pricing of and reimbursement timelines for pharmaceutical drugs countries with existing austerity measures may impose additional laws regulations or requirements on the healthcare industry in addition european governments that have not yet imposed austerity measures may impose them in the future any new austerity measures may be similar to or vary in scope and nature from existing austerity measures and could have a material adverse effect on our international business operations and results of operations

 

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive

 

the level of competition among retail pharmacies and pharmaceutical wholesalers is high changes in market dynamics or actions of competitors or manufacturers including industry consolidation and the emergence of new competitors could materially and adversely impact us our retail pharmacy businesses face intense competition from local regional national and global companies including other drugstore and pharmacy chains independent drugstores and pharmacies mailorder prescription providers and various other retailers such as grocery stores convenience stores mass merchants online and omnichannel pharmacies and retailers warehouse clubs dollar stores and other discount merchandisers some of which are aggressively expanding in markets we serve businesses in our pharmaceutical wholesale division face intense competition from direct competitors including national and regional cooperative wholesalers and alternative supply sources such as importers and manufacturers who supply directly to pharmacies competition may also come from other sources in the future as competition increases in the markets in which we operate a significant increase in general pricing pressures could occur which could require us to reevaluate our pricing structures to remain competitive for example if we are not able to anticipate and successfully respond to changes in market conditions in our pharmaceutical wholesale division including changes driven by competitors suppliers or manufacturers it could result in a loss of customers or renewal of contracts or arrangements on less favorable terms any failure to anticipate and timely and appropriately respond to evolving market conditions could result in decreased revenue and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations

 

if the merchandise and services that we offer fail to meet customer needs our sales may be adversely affected

 

we could be adversely affected by changes in consumer spending levels and shopping habits and preferences including attitudes towards our retail and product brands the success of our retail pharmacy businesses depends on our ability to offer a superior shopping experience a quality assortment of available merchandise and superior customer service we must identify obtain supplies of and offer to our customers attractive innovative and highquality merchandise on a continuous basis our products and services must satisfy the needs and desires of our customers whose preferences may change in the future it is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand if we misjudge either the demand for products and services we sell or our customers’ purchasing habits and tastes we may be faced with excess inventories of some products and missed opportunities for products and services we chose not to offer in addition our sales may decline or we may be required to sell the merchandise we have obtained at lower prices failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our customers and the demand for our products and services which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations

 

 13 

our private brand offerings expose us to various additional risks

 

in addition to brand name products we offer our customers private brand products that are not available from other retailers we seek to continue to grow our exclusive private brand offerings as part of our growth strategy including through the expanded offering of boots no7 and other brands owned or licensed on an exclusive basis as well as through selective acquisitions maintaining consistent product quality competitive pricing and availability of our private brand offerings for our customers is important in differentiating us from other retailers and developing and maintaining customer loyalty although we believe that our private brand products offer value to our customers and typically provide us with higher gross margins than comparable national brand products we sell the expansion of our private brand offerings also subjects us to additional risks such as potential product liability risks and mandatory or voluntary product recalls our ability to successfully protect our proprietary rights and successfully navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties our ability to successfully administer and comply with applicable contractual obligations and regulatory requirements and other risks generally encountered by entities that source sell and market exclusive branded offerings for retail an increase in sales of our private brands may also adversely affect sales of our vendors’ products which in turn could adversely affect our relationship with certain of our vendors any failure to adequately address some or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business operations results of operations and financial condition

 

if we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant omnichannel experience for our customers our businesses and results of operations could be adversely impacted

 

our business has evolved from an instore experience to interaction with customers across numerous channels including instore online mobile and social media among others omnichannel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing customer expectations and new developments by our competitors our customers are increasingly using computers tablets mobile phones and other devices to comparison shop determine product availability and complete purchases online we must compete by offering a consistent and convenient shopping experience for our customers regardless of the ultimate sales channel and by investing in providing and maintaining digital tools for our customers that have the right features and are reliable and easy to use if we are unable to make improve or develop relevant customerfacing technology in a timely manner our ability to compete and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected in addition if our online activities or our other customerfacing technology systems do not function as designed we may experience a loss of customer confidence data security breaches lost sales or be exposed to fraudulent purchases any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations reputation and results of operations

 

we may be constrained if we are unable to find suitable new store locations at acceptable prices or by the terms of our current leases

 

our ability to grow our retail pharmacy businesses may be constrained if suitable new store locations cannot be identified with lease terms or purchase prices that are acceptable to us we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores local land use and other regulations applicable to the types of stores we desire to construct may impact our ability to find suitable locations and influence the cost of constructing our stores the termination or expiration of leases at existing store locations may adversely affect us if the renewal terms of those leases are unacceptable to us and we are forced to close or relocate stores further changing local demographics at existing store locations may adversely affect revenue and profitability levels at those stores

 

we may experience a significant disruption in our computer systems

the protection of customer employee and company data is critical to our businesses cybersecurity and other information technology security risks such as a significant breach of customer employee or company data could attract a substantial amount of media attention damage our customer relationships and reputation and result in lost sales fines or lawsuits throughout our operations we receive retain and transmit certain personal information that our customers and others provide to purchase products or services fill prescriptions enroll in promotional programs participate in our customer loyalty programs register on our websites or otherwise communicate and interact with us in addition aspects of our operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks although we deploy a layered approach to address information security threats and vulnerabilities designed to protect confidential information against data security breaches a compromise of our data security systems or of those of businesses with whom we interact which results in confidential information being accessed obtained damaged or used by unauthorized or improper persons could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions and claims from customers financial institutions payment card associations and other persons any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations financial condition and results of operations in addition a security breach could require that we expend substantial additional resources related to the security of information systems and disrupt our businesses

 

the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding with the frequent imposition of new and changing requirements across businesses we are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing data privacy regulations in the united states and in other countries in which we operate that regulate the collection use and transfer of personal data including the transfer of personal data between or among countries some foreign data privacy regulations are more stringent than those in the united states we may also face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations compliance with changes in privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes if we or those with whom we share information fail to comply with these laws and regulations or experience a data security breach our reputation could be damaged and we could be subject to additional litigation and regulatory risks our security measures may be undermined due to the actions of outside parties employee error malfeasance or otherwise and as a result an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate business and personal information because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure damage to our reputation and potentially have a material adverse effect on our business operations financial condition and results of operations

 

we are subject to paymentrelated risks that could increase our operating costs expose us to fraud or theft subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business operations

 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including cash checks credit and debit cards apple pay™ and gift cards and we may offer new payment options over time acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules regulations contractual obligations and compliance requirements including payment network rules and operating guidelines data security standards and certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers these requirements and related interpretations may change over time which could make compliance more difficult or costly for certain payment methods including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which could increase over time and raise our operating costs we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards and other forms of electronic payment if these companies become unable to provide these services to us or if their systems are compromised it could disrupt our business the payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by persons who seek to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit any weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems if we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements or if data is compromised due to a breach or misuse of data relating to our payment systems we may be liable for costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments could be impaired in addition our reputation could suffer and our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types which could result in higher costs andor reduced sales and materially and adversely affect our results of operations

our growth strategy is partially dependent upon acquisitions joint ventures and other strategic investments some of which may not prove to be successful

 

we have grown in part through acquisitions in recent years and expect to continue to acquire or invest in businesses that build on or are deemed complementary to our existing businesses or further our growth strategies acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies distraction of management from overseeing and disruption of our existing operations difficulties in entering markets or lines of business in which we have no or limited direct prior experience the possible loss of key employees and customers and difficulties in achieving the synergies we anticipated any failure to select suitable acquisitions at fair prices conduct appropriate due diligence and successfully integrate the acquired company including particularly when acquired businesses operate in new geographic markets or areas of business could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations these transactions may also cause us to significantly increase our interest expense leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition or investment issue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders’ percentage ownership or incur asset writeoffs and restructuring costs and other related expenses

 

acquisitions joint ventures and strategic investments involve numerous other risks including potential exposure to unknown liabilities as well as undetected internal control regulatory or other issues or additional costs not anticipated at the time the transaction was completed no assurance can be given that our acquisitions joint ventures and other strategic investments will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business operations financial condition or results of operations

 

changes in healthcare regulatory environments may adversely affect our businesses

 

political economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to significant changes that could adversely affect our results of operations in recent years the healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to reduce costs and government spending these changes include an increased reliance on managed care cuts in certain medicare and medicaid funding in the united states and the funding of governmental payers in foreign jurisdictions consolidation of competitors suppliers and other market participants and the development of large sophisticated purchasing groups we expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future some of these potential changes such as a reduction in governmental funding at the state or federal level for certain healthcare services or adverse changes in legislation or regulations governing prescription drug pricing healthcare services or mandated benefits may cause customers to reduce the amount of our products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services we expect continued governmental and private payer pressure to reduce pharmaceutical pricing changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers’ pricing or distribution policies could also significantly reduce our profitability

 

the aca was enacted in 2010 to provide health insurance coverage to millions of previously uninsured americans through a combination of insurance market reforms an expansion of medicaid subsidies and health insurance mandates while certain provisions of the aca have already taken effect others have delayed effective dates or require further rulemaking action or regulatory guidance by governmental agencies to implement andor finalize as a result there remains considerable uncertainty as to the full impact of aca on our business operations future rulemaking or other regulatory actions under the aca or otherwise could increase regulation of pharmacy services result in changes to pharmacy reimbursement rates and otherwise change the way we do business we cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking or other regulatory actions but any such actions could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations

 

a significant change in or noncompliance with governmental regulations and other legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and profitability

changes in laws regulations and policies and the related interpretations may alter the landscape in which we do business and may affect our costs of doing business the impact of new laws regulations and policies generally cannot be predicted and changes in applicable laws regulations and policies may require extensive system and operational changes be difficult to implement increase our operating costs and require significant capital expenditures untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties that could adversely affect the continued operation of our businesses including suspension of payments from government programs loss of required government certifications loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government programs including the medicare and medicaid programs in the united states loss of licenses and significant fines or monetary penalties any failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements in the united states or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in significant legal and financial exposure damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business operations financial condition and results of operations

we have outstanding debt and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity as of august 31 2015 we had approximately 144 billion of outstanding indebtedness including shortterm borrowings our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 17 

we may incur or assume significantly more debt in the future including in connection with acquisitions strategic investments or joint ventures for example we incurred significant additional debt in connection with the second step transaction further we intend to finance our pending acquisition of rite aid through a combination of cash on hand and debt financing we have entered into a bridge facility commitment letter and expect to obtain permanent financing to replace such bridge facility prior to the closing of the transaction but cannot guarantee that we will obtain such permanent financing on terms that are acceptable to us or at all see “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in part ii  item 7 below and note 21 subsequent event to our consolidated financial statements in part ii  item 8 below if we add new debt and do not retire existing debt the risks described above could increase we also could be adversely impacted by any failure to renew or replace on terms acceptable to us or at all existing funding arrangements when they expire and any failure to satisfy applicable covenants

our credit ratings and ability to access wellfunctioning capital markets are important to us

historically we have relied on the public debt capital markets to fund portions of our capital investments and access to the commercial paper market and bank credit facilities as part of our working capital management strategy our continued access to these markets and the terms of such access depend on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets our operating performance and our credit ratings the major credit rating agencies have assigned us and our corporate debt investment grade credit ratings these ratings are based on a number of factors which include their assessment of our financial strength and financial policies we aim to maintain investment grade ratings as they serve to lower our borrowing costs and facilitate our access to a variety of lenders and other creditors including landlords for our leased stores on terms that we consider advantageous to our businesses however there can be no assurance that any particular rating assigned to us will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency if in that rating agencys judgment future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating so warrant incurrence of additional debt by us including if the pending acquisition of rite aid is completed outstanding rite aid indebtedness we acquire upon closing and any additional debt we issue in connection with the financing of the transaction could adversely affect our credit ratings any disruptions or turmoil in the capital markets or any downgrade of our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets which could materially and adversely affect our business operations financial condition and results of operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere herein this discussion contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in forwardlooking statements factors that might cause a difference include but are not limited to those discussed under “cautionary note regarding forwardlooking statements” below and in “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this form 10k references herein to the “company” “we” “us” or “our” refer to walgreens boots alliance inc and its subsidiaries from and after the effective time of the reorganization on december 31 2014 and prior to that time to its predecessor walgreen co and its subsidiaries and in each case do not include unconsolidated partiallyowned entities except as otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires

overview 

on december 31 2014 walgreens boots alliance inc became the successor of walgreen co pursuant to a merger to effect a reorganization of walgreens into a holding company structure with walgreens boots alliance becoming the parent holding company pursuant to the reorganization walgreens became a whollyowned subsidiary of walgreens boots alliance a delaware corporation formed for purposes of the reorganization and each issued and outstanding share of walgreens common stock was converted into one share of walgreens boots alliance common stock walgreens boots alliance as successor to walgreens replaced walgreens as the publiclyheld corporation

 

on december 31 2014 following the completion of the reorganization walgreens boots alliance completed the acquisition of the remaining 55 of alliance boots gmbh that walgreens did not previously own in exchange for £3133 billion 4874 billion in cash and approximately 1443 million shares of walgreens boots alliance common stock pursuant to the purchase and option agreement walgreens previously had acquired on august 2 2012 a 45 equity interest in alliance boots along with a call option to acquire the remaining 55 equity interest in alliance boots in exchange for 4025 billion in cash and approximately 834 million shares of walgreens common stock

prior to the completion of the second step transaction we accounted for our 45 investment in alliance boots using the equity method of accounting investments accounted for under the equity method are recorded initially at cost and subsequently adjusted for our share of the net income or loss and cash contributions and distributions to or from these entities net income reported by alliance boots during this period was translated from british pounds sterling at the average rate for the period upon completion of the second step transaction alliance boots became a consolidated subsidiary and ceased being accounted for under the equity method for financial reporting and accounting purposes walgreens boots alliance was the acquirer of alliance boots the consolidated financial statements and other data such as prescriptions filled reflect the results of operations and financial position of walgreens and its subsidiaries for periods prior to december 31 2014 and of walgreens boots alliance and its subsidiaries for periods from and after the effective time of the reorganization on december 31 2014

 

recent development 

on october 27 2015 the company entered into the merger agreement with rite aid pursuant to which the company agreed to acquire rite aid a drugstore chain in the united states with 4561 stores in 31 states and the district of columbia as of august 29 2015 on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement rite aid will become a whollyowned subsidiary of the company and rite aid stockholders will be entitled to receive 900 in cash for each outstanding share of rite aid common stock for a total enterprise value of approximately 172 billion including acquired net debt the transaction is expected to close in the second half of calendar 2016 subject to rite aid stockholder approval regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions

we intend to finance the transaction through a combination of cash on hand and debt financing concurrently with the signing of the merger agreement the company entered into a bridge facility commitment letter the commitment letter dated october 27 2015 with ubs securities llc and ubs ag stamford branch for a 128 billion senior unsecured bridge facility the “facility” the facility if funded will mature 364 days after the initial borrowings provided that the company can extend up to 30 billion of the facility for an additional 90 day period if desired the interest rate applicable to borrowings under the facility will be libor or the applicable base rate plus a margin the financing commitments of the lenders are subject to certain customary conditions set forth in the commitment letter we expect to obtain permanent financing for the transaction prior to the closing date which would replace the facility

 

comparability 

as a result of the completion of the second step transaction on december 31 2014 there are a number of items that affect comparability for the company historically walgreens operations were within one reportable segment that included the results of the retail pharmacy usa division and corporate costs along with the full consolidated results of wbad and equity earnings from alliance boots on a threemonth reporting lag upon completion of the second step transaction alliance boots became a consolidated subsidiary and the company eliminated the threemonth reporting lag prior period results have been recast to reflect the elimination of the reporting lag additionally following the completion of the reorganization and the second step transaction on december 31 2014 the company now reports results in three segments segmental reporting includes the allocation of synergy benefits including wbad’s results and the combined corporate costs for periods subsequent to december 31 2014 the company has determined that it is impracticable to allocate historical results to the current segmental presentation

the completion of the second step transaction on december 31 2014 also means that results for fiscal 2015 include the results of alliance boots for eight months january through august 2015 on a fully consolidated basis and four months september through december 2014 as equity income from walgreen’s preclosing 45 percent interest

the company’s balance sheet reflects the full consolidation of alliance boots assets and liabilities as a result of the close of the combination on december 31 2014 the company’s purchase accounting remains preliminary as contemplated by gaap and as a result there may be upon further review future changes to the value as well as allocation of the acquired assets and liabilities associated amortization expense goodwill and the gain on the previously held equity interest these changes may be material

yearoveryear comparisons of results require consideration of the foregoing factors and are not directly comparable

in addition the company’s sales are affected by a number of factors including among others our sales performance during holiday periods and during the cough cold and flu season significant weather conditions timing of our own or competitor discount programs and pricing actions levels of reimbursement from governmental agencies and other third party health providers and general economic conditions in the markets in which we operate

restructuring programs 

on april 8 2015 the board of directors approved a plan to implement a new restructuring program the “cost transformation program” as part of an initiative to reduce costs and increase operating efficiencies the cost transformation program implements and builds on the planned threeyear 10 billion costreduction initiative previously announced by walgreens on august 6 2014 and includes a number of elements designed to help achieve profitable growth through increased cost efficiencies we have identified additional opportunities for cost savings that increase the total expected cost savings of the cost transformation program by 500 million to a projected 15 billion by the end of fiscal 2017 significant areas of focus include plans to close approximately 200 stores across the us reorganize divisional and field operations drive operating efficiencies and streamline information technology and other functions the actions under the cost transformation program focus primarily on our retail pharmacy usa division and are expected to be substantially completed by the end of fiscal 2017

we currently estimate that we will recognize cumulative pretax charges to our gaap financial results of between 16 billion and 18 billion including costs associated with lease obligations and other real estate payments asset impairments and employee termination and other business transition and exit costs we expect to incur pretax charges of between 525 million and 600 million for real estate costs including lease obligations net of estimated sublease income between 650 million and 725 million for asset impairment charges relating primarily to asset writeoffs from store closures information technology inventory and other nonoperational real estate asset writeoffs and between 425 million and 475 million for employee severance and other business transition and exit costs we estimate that approximately 60 of the cumulative pretax charges will result in immediate or future cash expenditures primarily related to lease and other real estate payments and employee separation costs

we incurred pretax charges of 542 million 223 million related to asset impairment charges 202 million in real estate costs and 117 million in severance and other business transition and exit costs related to the cost transformation program in fiscal 2015 the majority of the charges incurred in fiscal 2015 related to activities within the retail pharmacy usa division but also included activities within retail pharmacy international all charges related to the cost transformation program have been recorded within selling general and administrative expenses we closed 84 stores in the united states related to the cost transformation program in fiscal 2015 

on march 24 2014 the board of directors approved a plan to close underperforming stores in efforts to optimize and focus resources within our retail pharmacy usa operations in a manner intended to increase shareholder value as of august 31 2015 we have closed 68 locations one of which was closed in fiscal 2015 in fiscal 2015 we incurred total pretax charges related to this plan of 17 million primarily related to lease termination costs in fiscal 2014 we incurred pretax charges of 209 million 137 million from lease termination costs 71 million from asset impairments and 1 million of other charges all charges related to this plan have been recorded within selling general and administrative expenses we expect to incur no additional costs related to this plan

walgreens boots alliance results of operations 

fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 

our results for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 are primarily impacted by the second step transaction which resulted in the full consolidation of alliance boots results of operations beginning december 31 2014 for fiscal 2015 the full consolidation of alliance boots operations increased our net sales by 294 gross profit by 236 selling general and administrative expenses by 241  and operating income by 185 each as compared to fiscal 2014

net earnings attributable to walgreens boots alliance inc for fiscal 2015 were 42 billion or 400 per diluted share as compared to 19 billion or 200 per diluted share in fiscal 2014 the increase in net earnings per diluted share for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily attributable to the full consolidation of alliance boots operations from january through august 2015 a gain on our 45 previously held equity interest in alliance boots increased sales in our retail pharmacy usa division increased income from our warrants to acquire amerisourcebergen common stock and a lower effective income tax rate these increases were partially offset by lower retail pharmacy usa gross margins and a higher interest expense

as a result of acquiring the remaining 55 interest in alliance boots on december 31 2014 our previously held 45 interest was remeasured to fair value resulting in a gain of 563 million in fiscal 2015 the fair value of the previously held equity interest in alliance boots was determined using the income approach methodology the fair value measurement of the previously held equity interest is based on significant inputs not observable in the market the fair value estimates for the previously held equity interest are based on a projected discounted cash flows b historical and projected financial information and c synergies including cost savings as relevant that market participants would consider when estimating the fair value of the previously held equity interest in alliance boots see note 8 acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

other income expense for fiscal 2015 was income of 685 million as compared to expense of 481 million in fiscal 2014 the change in fair value of our amerisourcebergen warrants resulted in recording income of 759 million and 366 million in fiscal 2015 and 2014 respectively the increase in fair value was primarily attributed to the change in the price of amerisourcebergen’s common stock in addition we recorded 20 million and 19 million in fiscal 2015 and 2014 respectively of other income relating to the amortization of the deferred credit associated with the initial value of the walgreens warrants we have also recorded a loss of 94 million in fiscal 2015 on derivative contracts that were not designated as accounting hedges the losses primarily relate to foreign currency forward contracts entered into in consideration of the delivery of foreign cash consideration related to the second step transaction fiscal 2014 results also included a loss of 866 million related to the alliance boots call option upon the amendment and immediate exercise of the call option to acquire the remaining 55 ownership of alliance boots we were required to compare the fair value of the amended option with the book value of the original option the fair value of the amended option was estimated to be zero based on its valuation as a financial instrument without regard for its strategic value the reduction in value was primarily due to the shorter duration of the amended option and the appreciation since the original valuation in the price of walgreens stock used as partial consideration for the purchase of the remaining 55 ownership interest in alliance boots 

 

 32 

interest was a net expense of 605 million and 156 million in fiscal 2015 and 2014 respectively the increase in fiscal 2015 interest expense is primarily due to the notes we issued to fund a portion of the cash consideration payable in connection with the second step transaction and to subsequently refinance substantially all of alliance boots outstanding borrowings following completion of the second step transaction additionally in fiscal 2015 we repaid a portion of our longterm debt in advance of its maturity resulting in additional net interest expense of 99 million

 

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 and 2014 was 199 and 429 respectively the decrease in the fiscal 2015 effective tax rate as compared to fiscal 2014 is primarily attributable to recording discrete tax benefits related to previously unrecognized capital loss deferred tax assets as a result of recognizing capital gain income from fiscal 2015 and anticipated future period saleleaseback transactions in addition as a result of our acquisition of the remaining 55 interest in alliance boots that we did not previously own our annual effective tax rate decreased due to incremental foreign source income taxed at lower rates and additional favorable permanent booktax differences also as a result of the acquisition we recognized a nonrecurring tax benefit that also lowered our annual effective tax rate in addition we recognized other net discrete tax benefits in the current fiscal year

walgreens boots alliance adjusted net earnings per diluted share nongaap measure 

adjusted net earnings per diluted share for fiscal 2015 was 388 an increase of 183 from 328 in fiscal 2014 the increase in adjusted net earnings per diluted share in fiscal 2015 was primarily attributable to the full consolidation of alliance boots operations from january through august 2015 increased sales and lower selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in our retail pharmacy usa division and a lower effective income tax rate these increases were partially offset by lower retail pharmacy usa gross margins and a higher interest expense see “nongaap measures” below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measure

fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 

net earnings attributable to walgreens boots alliance inc for fiscal 2014 were 19 billion or 200 per diluted share as compared to 25 billion or 267 per diluted share in fiscal 2013 the decrease in fiscal 2014 net earnings per diluted share as compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily attributable to lower gross margins in our retail pharmacy usa division a loss related to the alliance boots call option and a higher effective tax rate partially offset by higher sales lower selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased equity earnings in alliance boots and increased gains on fair market value adjustments related to our amerisourcebergen warrants

other income expense for the fiscal 2014 was expense of 481 million as compared to income of 120 million in fiscal 2013 fiscal 2014 results include a loss of 866 million related to the alliance boots call option the change in fair value of our amerisourcebergen warrants resulted in recording income of 366 million and 111 million in fiscal 2014 and 2013 respectively the increase in fair value was primarily attributed to the change in the price of amerisourcebergen’s common stock in addition we recorded 19 million and 9 million in fiscal 2014 and 2013 respectively of other income relating to the amortization of the deferred credit associated with the initial value of the walgreens warrants

interest was a net expense of 156 million and 165 million in fiscal 2014 and 2013 respectively the decrease in fiscal 2014 interest expense as compared to fiscal 2013 was due to the repayment of notes that matured in fiscal 2014 partially offset by higher interest charges related to incremental capital and finance lease obligations

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 and 2013 was 429 and 370 respectively the increase in the fiscal 2014 effective tax rate as compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily attributable to the loss associated with the company’s option to purchase the remaining equity interest in alliance boots which did not generate a tax benefit in fiscal 2014 partially offset by the favorable impact of additional foreign source income taxed at lower rates

walgreens boots alliance adjusted net earnings per diluted share nongaap measure 

adjusted net earnings per diluted share for fiscal 2014 were 328 compared to 325 in fiscal 2013 the increase in adjusted net earnings per diluted share for the fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily attributed to higher sales lower selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales and increased equity earnings in alliance boots partially offset by lower gross margins in our retail pharmacy usa division see “nongaap measures” below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measure

sales fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 

the retail pharmacy usa division’s total sales for fiscal 2015 increased by 60 to 810 billion total sales increased primarily due to higher comparable store sales which were up 64 in fiscal 2015 comparable drugstores are defined as those that have been open for at least twelve consecutive months without closure for seven or more consecutive days and without a major remodel or a natural disaster in the past twelve months relocated and acquired stores are not included as comparable stores for the first twelve months after the relocation or acquisition we operated 8182 locations 8173 drugstores as of august 31 2015 compared to 8309 locations 8207 drugstores a year earlier prior year’s locations included 91 infusion and respiratory services facilities in which we sold a majority interest in fiscal 2015

operating income fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 

retail pharmacy usa division’s operating income for fiscal 2015 decreased 72 to 39 billion the decrease is primarily due to having equity earnings in alliance boots for four months in the current year versus twelve months in the comparable period and current year costs related to the cost transformation program

gross margin as a percent of total sales was 269 in fiscal 2015 compared to 282 in fiscal 2014 pharmacy margins were negatively impacted in the current fiscal year by lower thirdparty reimbursements an increase in medicare part d mix including the strategy to continue driving 90day prescriptions at retail and the mix of specialty drugs which carry a lower margin percentage the decrease in pharmacy margins was partially offset by additional brandtogeneric drug conversions compared with the prior fiscal year retail margins were positively impacted in fiscal 2015 primarily from the nonprescription drug beauty and beverage and snack categories partially offset by the electronics category

critical accounting policies 

the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and include amounts based on management’s prudent judgments and estimates actual results may differ from these estimates management believes that any reasonable deviation from those judgments and estimates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations to the extent that the estimates used differ from actual results however adjustments to the statement of earnings and corresponding balance sheet accounts would be necessary these adjustments would be made in future periods some of the more significant estimates include business combinations goodwill and other intangible asset impairment allowance for doubtful accounts vendor allowances asset impairments liability for closed locations cost of sales and inventory equity method investments pension and postretirement benefits and income taxes we use the following methods to determine our estimates

 

business combinations – we account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that once control is obtained all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition the determination of fair values of assets and liabilities acquired requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available

 

for intangible assets we typically use the income approach to determine fair value the income approach requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions primarily include but are not limited to the discount rates terminal growth rates and forecasts of revenue operating income depreciation and amortization and capital expenditures the discount rates which are applied to the projections reflect the risk factors associated with those projections

 

although we believe our estimates of fair value are reasonable actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on the determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired

 

judgment is also required in determining the intangible asset’s useful life as different assets will have different lives with some assets determined to have indefinite useful lives

 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment – goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value as part of our impairment analysis for each reporting unit we engage a third party appraisal firm to assist in the determination of estimated fair value for each reporting unit this determination includes estimating the fair value using both the income and market approaches the income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit including projected future operating results economic projections anticipated future cash flows and discount rates the market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping

the determination of the fair value of the reporting units and the allocation of that value to individual assets and liabilities within those reporting units requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions primarily include but are not limited to the selection of appropriate peer group companies control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we compete the discount rates terminal growth rates and forecasts of revenue operating income depreciation and amortization and capital expenditures the allocation requires several analyses to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities including among other things purchased prescription files customer relationships pharmacy licenses and trade names although we believe our estimates of fair value are reasonable actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units the amount of any goodwill impairment charge or both

we also compared the sum of the estimated fair values of the reporting units to the company’s total value as implied by the market value of the company’s equity and debt securities this comparison indicated that in total our assumptions and estimates were reasonable however future declines in the overall market value of the company’s equity and debt securities may indicate that the fair value of one or more reporting units has declined below its carrying value

 

one measure of the sensitivity of the amount of goodwill impairment charges to key assumptions is the amount by which each reporting unit “passed” fair value exceeds the carrying amount or “failed” the carrying amount exceeds fair value the first step of the goodwill impairment test our reporting units’ fair values exceeded their carrying amounts ranging from approximately 12 to more than 130 see note 9 goodwill and other intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

 

 43 

indefinitelived intangible assets are tested by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value

 

our indefinitelived intangible asset fair value is estimated by discounting the hypothetical royalty payments to their present value over the estimated economic life of the asset these estimates can be affected by a number of factors including but not limited to general economic conditions availability of market information as well as our profitability

 

based on current knowledge we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to determine impairment

allowance for doubtful accounts   – the provision for bad debt is based on estimates of recoverability using both historical writeoff percentages and specifically identified receivables based on current knowledge we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to determine the allowance

vendor allowances – vendor allowances are principally received as a result of purchases sales or promotion of vendors’ products allowances are generally recorded as a reduction of inventory and are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales when the related merchandise is sold those allowances received for promoting vendors’ products are offset against advertising expense and result in a reduction of selling general and administrative expenses to the extent of advertising incurred with the excess treated as a reduction of inventory costs based on current knowledge we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to determine vendor allowances

asset impairments – the impairment of longlived assets is assessed based upon both qualitative and quantitative factors including years of operation and expected future cash flows and tested for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that a certain asset may be impaired if the future cash flows reveal that the carrying value of the asset group may not be recoverable an impairment charge is immediately recorded based on current knowledge we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to determine asset impairments

liability for closed locations – the liability is based on the present value of future rent obligations and other related costs net of estimated sublease rent to the first lease option date based on current knowledge we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to determine the liability

cost of sales and inventory – drugstore cost of sales in the retail pharmacy usa segment is derived based on pointofsale scanning information with an estimate for shrinkage and adjusted based on periodic inventory counts inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market determined by the lastin firstout “lifo” method for the retail pharmacy usa segment and on a firstin firstout “fifo” basis for inventory in the retail pharmacy international and pharmaceutical wholesale segments except for retail inventory in the retail pharmacy international segment which is valued using the retail method based on current knowledge we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to determine cost of sales or inventory

equity method investments   – we use the equity method to account for investments in companies if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence but not control over operating and financial policies of the investee our proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies is included in consolidated net earnings judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as our ownership interest representation on the board of directors participation in policymaking decisions and material purchase and sale transactions based on current knowledge we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to determine the amounts recorded for equity method investments

 

 44 

pension and postretirement benefits – we have various defined benefit pension plans that cover some of our foreign employees we also have postretirement healthcare plans that cover qualifying domestic employees eligibility and the level of benefits for these plans varies depending on participants’ status date of hire and or length of service our pension and postretirement expenses and valuations are dependent on assumptions used by our actuaries in calculating those amounts these assumptions include discount rates healthcare cost trends longterm rate of return on plan assets retirement rates mortality rates and other factors in determining our longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption we consider both the historical performance of the investment portfolio as well as the longterm market return expectations based on the investment mix of the portfolio

our policy is to fund our pension plans in accordance with applicable regulations our postretirement healthcare plans are not funded based on current knowledge we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to determine pension and postretirement benefits

income taxes – we are subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business us federal state local and foreign tax authorities raise questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions in evaluating the tax benefits associated with our various tax filing positions we record a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized adjustments are made to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which we determine the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities the statute of limitations expires for the return containing the tax position or when more information becomes available our liability for unrecognized tax benefits including accrued penalties and interest is primarily included in other longterm liabilities and current income taxes on our consolidated balance sheets and in income tax provision in our consolidated statements of earnings

in determining our provision for income taxes we use income permanent differences between book and tax income and enacted statutory income tax rates the provision for income taxes also reflects our assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits in addition to any foreignbased income deemed to be taxable in the united states discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur based on current knowledge we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to determine the amounts recorded for income taxes

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

interest rate risk

we are exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to existing debt issuances primary exposures include us treasury rates libor and commercial paper rates from time to time we use interest rate swaps and forwardstarting interest rate swaps to hedge our exposure to the impact of interest rate changes on existing debt and future debt issuances respectively to reduce the volatility of our financing costs and based on current and projected market conditions achieve a desired proportion of fixed versus floatingrate debt generally under these swaps we agree with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixedrate and floatingrate interest amounts based on an agreed upon notional principal amount

we also use interest rate caps to protect from rising interest rates on existing floatingrate debt information regarding our interest rate swaps forward starting interest rate swaps and interest rate caps transactions are set forth in note 11 financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements these financial instruments are sensitive to changes in interest rates on august 31 2015 we had approximately 3 billion in debt obligations that had floating interest rates a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates for the various debt held by the company would increase or decrease the annual interest expense we recognize and the cash we pay for interest expense by approximately 30 million this amount excludes the impact of any associated interest rate swaps forward starting interest rate swaps and interest rate caps

foreign currency exchange rate risk

as a result of the second step transaction fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily with respect to the british pound sterling and   euro   and certain other foreign currencies including the mexican peso chilean peso norwegian krone and turkish lira will affect the company’s net investment in foreign subsid iaries and will cause fluctuations in cash flows related to foreign denominated transactions we are also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the us dollar we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on nonfunctional currency cash flows of certain entities denominated in foreign currencies these transactions are almost exclusively less than 12 months in maturity in addition we enter into foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated in hedging relationships to offset in part the impacts of certain intercompany activities primarily associated with intercompany financing transactions   as circumstances warrant we also use basis swaps   as hedging instruments to hedge portions of our net investments in foreign operations the foreign currency derivative instruments are sensitive to changes in exchange rates a 1 increase or decrease in exchange rates would increase or decrease our pretax income by approximately 3 million due to changes in the value of foreign currency instruments excluded from the computation were anticipated transactions foreign currency trade payables and receivables and net investments in foreign subsidiaries which the abovementioned instruments are intended to partially hedge 

equity price risk 

changes in amerisourcebergen common stock price and equity volatility may have a significant impact on the value of the warrants to acquire amerisourcebergen common stock described in note 11 financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k as of august 31 2015 a one dollar change in amerisourcebergen’s common stock would holding other factors constant increase or decrease the fair value of the company’s warrants by 45 million additionally the company holds an investment in amerisourcebergen common stock as of august 31 2015 a one dollar change in amerisourcebergen common stock would increase or decrease the fair value of the company’s investment by 11 million

changes in internal control over financial reporting

in connection with the evaluation pursuant to exchange act rule 13a15d of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rule 13a15f by the c ompany’s management including its ceo and cfo except as noted below no changes during the quarter ended august 31 2015 were identified that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting as a result of the closing of the second step transaction the company has incorporated internal controls over significant processes specific to the acquisition that it believes to be appropriate and necessary in consideration of the level of related integration as the postclosing integration continues the company will continue to review the internal controls and processes of alliance boots and may take further steps to integrate such controls and processes with those of the company

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls

our management including the ceo and cfo do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures
