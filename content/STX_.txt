industry overview 

data storage industry 

the data storage industry includes companies that manufacture components or subcomponents designed for data storage devices as well as providers of storage solutions software and services for enterprise cloud big data computing platforms and consumer markets the rapid growth of data generation and the intelligent application of data are driving demand for data storage as more data is created at endpoints outside traditional data centers which requires processing at the edge and in the core or cloud the need for data storage and management between the edge and cloud has also increased use cases include connected and autonomous vehicles smart manufacturing and smart cities we believe the proliferation and personal creation of mediarich digital content further enabled by fifthgeneration wireless “5g” technology the edge the internet of things “iot” machine learning “ml” and artificial intelligence “ai” will continue to create demand for higher capacity storage solutions the resulting mass data ecosystem is expected to require increasing amounts of data storage at the edge in the core and in between 

markets 

the principal data storage markets include 

mass capacity storage markets 

mass capacity storage supports high capacity lowcost per terabyte “tb” storage applications including nearline video and image applications “via” and networkattached storage “ nas” and edgetocloud data storage infrastructures 

nearline nearline applications require mass capacity devices and mass capacity subsystems that provide endtoend solutions to businesses for the purpose of modular and scalable storage enterprise storage applications require both highcapacity and energy efficient storage devices to support low total cost of ownership seagate systems offer mass capacity storage solutions that provide foundational infrastructure for public and private clouds the nearline market includes storage for cloud computing content delivery archival backup services and newer use cases 

via and nas via and nas drives are specifically designed to ensure the appropriate performance and reliability of the system for video analytics and camera enabled environments or network storage environments these markets include storage for security and smart video installations 

edgetocloud data storage infrastructures transport and activation of mass data the seagate lyve portfolio grew out of our mass capacity storage portfolio it provides a simple costefficient and secure way to manage transport and activate massive volumes of data across the distributed enterprise among other elements the lyve portfolio includes a shuttle solution that enables enterprises to transfer vast amounts of data from endpoints to the core cloud and a storageasaservice cloud that provides frictionless mass capacity storage at the metro edge 

legacy markets 

legacy markets include consumer mission critical and client applications we continue to sell to these markets but do not plan significant additional investment 

consumer storage consumer applications are externally connected storage both hdd and ssdbased used to provide backup capabilities augmented storage capacity or portable storage for pcs mobile devices and gaming consoles 

mission critical storage mission critical applications are defined as those that use very highperformance enterprise class hdds and ssds with sophisticated firmware to reliably support very high workloads we expect that enterprises utilizing dedicated storage area networks will continue to drive market demand for mission critical enterprise storage solutions 

client storage client applications include desktop and notebook storage that rely on low costperhdd and ssd devices to provide builtin storage digital video recorder “dvr” storage for video streaming in alwayson consumer premise equipment and media center and gaming storage for pcbased gaming systems as well as console gaming applications including both internal and external storage options 

participants in the data storage industry include 

major subcomponent manufacturers companies that manufacture components or subcomponents used in data storage devices or solutions include companies that supply spindle motors heads and media and application specific integrated circuits “asics” 

storage device manufacturers companies that transform components into storage products include disk drive manufacturers and semiconductor storage manufacturers that integrate flash memory into storage products such as ssds 

storage solutions manufacturers and system integrators companies such as original equipment manufacturers “oems” that bundle and package storage solutions distributors that integrate storage hardware and software into enduser applications cloud service providers “csps” that provide cloud based solutions to businesses for the purpose of scaleout storage solutions and modular systems and producers of solutions such as storage racks 

hyperscale data centers large hyperscale data center companies many of which are csps are increasingly designing their own storage subsystems and having them built by contract manufacturers for their own data centers this trend is reshaping the storage system and subsystem market driving both innovation in system design and changes in the competitive landscape of large storage system vendors 

storage services companies that provide and host services and solutions which include storage backup archiving recovery and discovery of data 

demand for data storage 

in the seagatesponsored “worldwide global datasphere forecast 20222026” the international data corporation “idc” forecasted that the global datasphere should grow from 84 zettabytes in 2021 to 221 zettabytes by 2026 according to 

idc we are fast approaching a new era of the data age which we expect will have a positive impact on storage demand the digital transformation has given rise to many new applications all of which rely on faster access to and secure storage of data proliferating from endpoints through edge to cloud 

the datasphere forecast study found that data is shifting to both the core and the edge and by 2026 nearly 65 of the world’s data will be stored in the core and edge up from 41 in 2016 

as more applications require realtime decision making some data processing and storage is moving closer to the network edge we believe this will result in a buildup of private and edge cloud environments that will enable fast and secure access to data throughout the iot ecosystem 

factors contributing to the growth of digital content include 

• creation sharing and consumption of mediarich content such as highresolution photos high definition videos and digital music through smart phones tablets digital cameras personal video cameras dvrs gaming consoles or other digital devices 

• increasing use of video and imaging sensors to collect and analyze data used to improve traffic flow emergency response times and manufacturing production costs as well as for new security surveillance systems that feature higher resolution digital cameras and thus require larger data storage capacities 

• creation and collection of data through the development and evolution of the iot ecosystem big data analytics ai and new technology trends such as autonomous vehicles and drones smart manufacturing and smart cities  as well as emerging trends that converge the digital and physical worlds such as the metaverse or use of digital twins 

• the growing use of analytics especially for action on data created at the edge instead of processing and analyzing at the data center which is particularly important for verticals such as autonomous vehicles property monitoring systems and smart manufacturing 

• cloud migration initiatives and the ongoing advancement of the cloud including the build out of large numbers of cloud data centers by csps and private companies transitioning onsite data centers into the cloud and 

• need for protection of increased digital content through redundant storage on backup devices and externally provided storage services 

as a result of these factors we anticipate that the nature and volume of data being created will require greater storage capability which is more efficiently and economically facilitated by higher capacity mass storage devices 

in addition the economics of storage infrastructure are also evolving the utilization of public and private hyperscale storage and opensource solutions is reducing the total cost of ownership of storage while increasing the speed and efficiency with which customers can leverage massive computing and storage devices accordingly we expect these trends will continue to create significant demand for data storage products and solutions going forward 

demand trends 

we believe that continued growth in digital content creation will require increasingly higher storage capacity in order to store aggregate host distribute analyze manage protect back up and use such content we also believe that as architectures evolve to serve a growing commercial and consumer user base throughout the world storage solutions will evolve as well 

mass capacity is and will continue to be the enabler of scale we expect increased data creation will lead to the expansion of the need for storage in the form of hdds ssds and systems while the advance of solid state technology in many end markets is expected to increase we believe that in the foreseeable future cloud edge and traditional enterprise which require highcapacity storage solutions will be best served by hdds due to their ability to deliver reliable energyefficient and the most cost effective mass storage devices we also believe that as hdd capacities continue to increase a focus exclusively on unit demand does not reflect the increase in demand for exabytes as demand for higher capacity drives increases the demand profile has shifted to reflect fewer total hdd units but with higher average capacity per drive and higher overall exabyte demand 

industry supply balance 

from time to time the storage industry has experienced periods of imbalance between supply and demand to the extent that the storage industry builds or maintains capacity based on expectations of demand that do not materialize price erosion may become more pronounced conversely during periods where demand exceeds supply price erosion is generally muted 

our business 

data storage technologies 

the design and manufacturing of hdds depends on highly advanced technology and manufacturing techniques therefore it requires high levels of research and development spending and capital equipment investments we design fabricate and assemble a number of the most important components in our disk drives including readwrite heads and recording media our design and manufacturing operations are based on technology platforms that are used to produce various disk drive products that serve multiple data storage applications and markets our core technology platforms focus on the areal density of media and readwrite head technologies including innovations like shingledmagneticrecording smr technology the highcapacity enabling heatassisted magnetic recording “hamr” technology and the throughputoptimizing multi actuator mach2 technology this design and manufacturing approach allows us to deliver a portfolio of storage products to service a wide range of data storage applications and industries 

disk drives that we manufacture are commonly differentiated by the following key characteristics 

• inputoutput operations per second “iops” commonly expressed in megabytes per second which is the maximum number of reads and writes to a storage location 

• storage capacity commonly expressed in tb which is the amount of data that can be stored on the disk drive 

• spindle rotation speed commonly expressed in revolutions per minute “rpm” which has an effect on speed of access to data 

• interface transfer rate commonly expressed in megabytes per second which is the rate at which data moves between the disk drive and the computer controller 

• average seek time commonly expressed in milliseconds which is the time needed to position the heads over a selected track on the disk surface 

• data transfer rate commonly expressed in megabytes per second which is the rate at which data is transferred to and from the disk drive 

• product quality and reliability commonly expressed in annualized return rates and 

• energy efficiency commonly measured by the power output such as energy per tb necessary to operate the disk drive 

areal density is measured by storage capacity per square inch on the recording surface of a disk the storage capacity of a disk drive is determined by the size and number of disks it contains as well as the areal density capability of these disks 

we also offer ssds as part of our storage solutions portfolio our portfolio includes devices with sata sas and nvme interfaces the ssds differ from hdds in that they are without mechanical parts 

ssds store data on nand flash memory cells or metaloxide semiconductor transistors using a charge on a capacitor to represent a binary digit ssd technology offers fast access to data and robust performance ssds complement hyperscale applications highdensity data centers cloud environments and web servers they are also used in missioncritical enterprise applications consumer gaming and nas applications 

the sshds that we manufacture contain technology that fuses some features of ssds and hdds they include hdds with flash memory that acts as a cache to improve performance of frequently accessed data and are primarily targeted at pc gaming applications 

manufacturing 

we primarily design and manufacture our own readwrite heads and recording media which are critical technologies for disk drives this integrated approach enables us to lower costs and to improve the functionality of components so that they work together efficiently 

we believe that because of our vertical design and manufacturing strategy we are well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities to leverage the close interdependence of components for disk drives our manufacturing efficiency and flexibility are critical elements of our integrated business strategy we continuously seek to improve our manufacturing efficiency and reduce manufacturing costs by 

• employing manufacturing automation 

• employing machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence 

• improving product quality and reliability 

• integrating our supply chain with suppliers and customers to enhance our demand visibility and reduce our working capital requirements 

• coordinating between our manufacturing group and our research and development organization to rapidly achieve volume manufacturing and 

• operating our facilities at optimal capacities 

a vertically integrated model however tends to have less flexibility when demand declines as it exposes us to higher unit costs when capacity utilization is not optimized 

components and raw materials 

disk drives incorporate certain components including a head disk assembly and a printed circuit board mounted to the head disk assembly which are sealed inside a rigid base and top cover containing the recording components in a contaminationcontrolled environment we maintain a highly integrated approach to our business by designing and manufacturing a significant portion of the components we view as critical to our products such as readwrite heads and recording media 

readwrite heads the function of the readwrite head is to scan across the disk as it spins magnetically recording or reading information the tolerances of readwrite heads are extremely demanding and require stateoftheart equipment and processes our readwrite heads are manufactured with thinfilm and photolithographic processes similar to those used to produce semiconductor integrated circuits though challenges related to magnetic film properties and topographical structures are unique to the disk drive industry we perform all primary stages of design and manufacture of readwrite heads at our facilities we use a combination of internally manufactured and externally sourced readwrite heads the mix of which varies based on product mix technology and our internal capacity levels 

media data is written to or read from the media or disk as it rotates at very high speeds past the readwrite head the media is made from nonmagnetic substrates usually an aluminum alloy or glass and is coated with thin layers of magnetic materials we use a combination of internally manufactured and externally sourced finished media and aluminum substrates the mix of which varies based on product mix technology and our internal capacity levels we purchase all of our glass substrates from third parties 

printed circuit board assemblies the printed circuit board assemblies “pcbas” are comprised of standard and custom asics and ancillary electronic control chips the asics control the movement of data to and from the readwrite heads and through the internal controller and interface which communicates with the host computer the asics and control chips form electronic circuitry that delivers instructions to a head positioning mechanism called an actuator to guide the heads to the selected track of a disk where the data is recorded or retrieved disk drive manufacturers use one or more industry standard interfaces such as sata scsi or sas to communicate to the host systems 

head disk assembly the head disk assembly consists of one or more disks attached to a spindle assembly powered by a spindle motor that rotates the disks at a high constant speed around a hub readwrite heads mounted on an arm assembly similar in concept to that of a record player fly extremely close to each disk surface and record data on and retrieve it from concentric tracks in the magnetic layers of the rotating disks the readwrite heads are mounted vertically on an eshaped assembly “eblock” that is actuated by a voicecoil motor to allow the heads to move from track to track the eblock and the recording media are mounted inside the head disk assembly we purchase spindle motors from outside vendors and from time to time participate in the design of the motors that go into our products 

disk drive assembly following the completion of the head disk assembly it is mated to the pcba and the completed unit goes through extensive defect mapping and machine learning prior to packaging and shipment disk drive assembly and machine learning operations occur primarily at our facilities located in china and thailand we perform subassembly and component manufacturing operations at our facilities in china malaysia northern ireland singapore thailand and the united states 

contract manufacturing we outsource the manufacturing and assembly of certain components and products to third parties in various countries worldwide this includes outsourcing the pcbas used in our disk drives ssds and storage subsystems we continue to participate in the design of our components and products and we are directly involved in qualifying key suppliers and components used in our products 

suppliers of components and industry constraints there are a limited number of independent suppliers of components such as recording heads and media available to disk drive manufacturers vertically integrated disk drive manufacturers like us who manufacture their own components are less dependent on external component suppliers than less vertically integrated disk drive manufacturers however certain parts of our business have been adversely affected by our suppliers’ capacity constraints and this could occur in the future 

commodity and other manufacturing costs the production of disk drives requires rare earth elements precious metals scarce alloys and industrial commodities which are subject to fluctuations in price and the supply of which has at times been constrained in addition to increased costs of components and commodities volatility in fuel and other transportation costs may also increase our costs related to commodities manufacturing and freight as a result we may increase our use of alternative shipment methods to help offset any increase in freight costs and we will continually review various forms of shipments and routes in order to minimize the exposure to higher freight costs

our distributors generally enter into nonexclusive agreements for the resale of our products they typically furnish us with a nonbinding indication of their nearterm requirements and product deliveries are generally scheduled accordingly the agreements and related sales programs typically provide the distributors with limited rights of return and price protection in addition we offer sales programs to distributors on a quarterly and periodic basis to promote the sale of selected products in the sales channel 

our retail channel consists of our branded storage products sold to retailers either by us directly or by our distributors retail sales made by us or our distributors typically require greater marketing support sales incentives and price protection periods 

see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data— note 16 business segment and geographic information ” contained in this report for a description of our major customers 

competition 

we compete primarily with manufacturers of hard drives used in the mass capacity storage and legacy markets and with other companies in the data storage industry that provide ssds and systems some of the principal factors used by customers to differentiate among data storage solutions manufacturers are storage capacity product performance product quality and reliability price per unit and price per tb storageretrieval access times data transfer rates form factor product warranty and support capabilities supply continuity and flexibility power consumption total cost of ownership and brand while different markets and customers place varying levels of emphasis on these factors we believe that our products are competitive with respect to many of these factors in the markets that we currently compete in 

principal competitors we compete with manufacturers of storage solutions and the other principal manufacturers in the data storage solution industry including 

• micron technology inc 

• samsung electronics 

• sk hynix inc 

• kioxia holdings corporation 

• toshiba corporation and 

• western digital corporation operating the western digital hitachi global storage technologies and sandisk brands 

price erosion historically our industry has been characterized by price declines for data storage products with comparable capacity performance and feature sets “likeforlike products” price declines for likeforlike products “price erosion” tend to be more pronounced during periods of 

• economic contraction in which competitors may use discounted pricing to attempt to maintain or gain market share 

• few new product introductions when competitors have comparable or alternative product offerings and 

• industry supply exceeding demand 

data storage manufacturers typically attempt to offset price erosion with an improved mix of data storage products characterized by higher capacity better performance and additional feature sets and product cost reductions 

we believe the hdd industry experienced modest price erosion in fiscal years 2022 and 2021 

product life cycles and changing technology success in our industry has been dependent to a large extent on the ability to balance the introduction and transition of new products with timetovolume performance capacity and quality metrics at a competitive price level of service and support that our customers expect generally the drive manufacturer that introduces a new product first benefits from improved product mix favorable profit margins and less pricing pressure until comparable products are introduced changing technology also necessitates ongoing investments in research and development which may be difficult to recover due to rapid product life cycles or economic declines further there is a continuing need to successfully execute product transitions and new product introductions as factors such as quality reliability and manufacturing yields continue to be of significant competitive importance 

cyclicality and seasonality 

our mass capacity markets are subject to variability of sales which can be attributed to the timing of it spending or a reflection of cyclical demand from csps based on the timing of their procurement and deployment requirements and their ability to procure other components needed to build out data center infrastructure our legacy markets such as consumer storage applications traditionally experienced seasonal variability in demand with higher levels of demand in the first half of the fiscal year primarily driven by consumer spending related to backtoschool season and traditional holiday shopping season 

research and development 

we are committed to developing new component technologies products alternative storage technologies inclusive of systems software and other innovative technology solutions to support emerging applications in data use and storage our research and development activities are designed to bring new products to market in high volume with quality attributes that our customers expect before our competitors part of our product development strategy is to leverage a design platform andor subsystem within product families to serve different market needs this platform strategy allows for more efficient resource utilization leverages best design practices reduces exposure to changes in demand and allows for achievement of lower costs through purchasing economies our advanced technology integration effort focuses disk drive and component research on recording subsystems including readwrite heads and recording media marketspecific product technology and technology we believe may lead to new business opportunities the primary purpose of our advanced technology integration effort is to ensure timely availability of mature component technologies for our product development teams as well as to allow us to leverage and coordinate those technologies in the design centers across our products in order to take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace 

patents and licenses 

as of july 1 2022 we had approximately 4800 us patents and 720 patents issued in various foreign jurisdictions as well as approximately 550 us and 140 foreign patent applications pending the number of patents and patent applications will vary at any given time as part of our ongoing patent portfolio management activity due to the rapid technological change that characterizes the data storage industry we believe that in addition to patent protection the improvement of existing products reliance upon trade secrets protection of unpatented proprietary knowhow and development of new products are also important to our business in establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage accordingly we intend to continue our efforts to broadly protect our intellectual property including obtaining patents where available in connection with our research and development program 

the data storage industry is characterized by significant litigation arising from time to time relating to patent and other intellectual property rights from time to time we receive claims that our products infringe patents of third parties although we have been able to resolve some of those claims or potential claims without a material adverse effect on us other claims have resulted in adverse decisions or settlements in addition other claims are pending which if resolved unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations for more information on these claims see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data— note 14 legal environmental and other contingencies ” the costs of 

engaging in intellectual property litigation in the past have been and in the future may be substantial irrespective of the merits of the claim or the outcome 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we operate relating to the protection of the environment including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites some of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution and these permits are subject to modification renewal and revocation by issuing authorities 

we have established environmental management systems and continually update environmental policies and standard operating procedures for our operations worldwide we believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws regulations and permits we budget for operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental laws if additional or more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future we could incur additional operating costs and capital expenditures 

some environmental laws such as the us comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended the “superfund” law and its state equivalents can impose liability for the cost of cleanup of contaminated sites upon any of the current or former site owners or operators or upon parties who sent waste to these sites regardless of whether the owner or operator owned the site at the time of the release of hazardous substances or the lawfulness of the original disposal activity we have been identified as a responsible or potentially responsible party at several sites based on current estimates of cleanup costs and our expected allocation of these costs we do not expect costs in connection with these sites to be material 

we may be subject to various state federal and international laws and regulations governing environmental matters including those restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products for example the european union “eu” enacted the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment 201165eu which prohibits the use of certain substances including lead in certain products including disk drives and server storage products put on the market after july 1 2006 similar legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions including in the us canada mexico taiwan china and japan the eu reach directive registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals ec 19072006 also restricts substances of very high concern in products if we or our suppliers fail to comply with the substance restrictions recycle requirements or other environmental requirements as they are enacted worldwide it could have a materially adverse effect on our business 

social and employee matters 

as of july 1 2022 we employed approximately 40000 employees and temporary employees worldwide of which approximately 36000 were located in our asia operations we believe that our employees are crucial to our current success and that our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract retain and further motivate qualified employees at all levels we believe that our employee relations are good 

diversity equity  inclusion one of our core values is inclusion we rely on our diverse workforce to develop deliver and sustain our business strategy and achieve our goals one way we embrace our diverse employees and promote a culture of inclusion is through the support of employee resource groups “erg” these voluntary employeeled communities are built on a shared diversity of identity experience or thought and provide a number of benefits to employees including professional and leadership development seagate’s erg community encompasses a wide array of diversity such as lgbtq women people of color and interfaith and includes over 26 chapters across six countries we also support inclusion through active employee communications unconscious bias education and ongoing efforts to ensure our employees feel safe respected and welcomed during fiscal year 2022 we published our third annual diversity equity and inclusion “dei” report which provides an overview of our dei efforts and outcomes including demographics on our workforce the fiscal year 2021 dei report is available on our website 

health  safety all our manufacturing sites have health and safety management systems certified to iso 45001 in addition we are audited to health and safety standards set forth by the responsible business alliance our global health and safety standards as well as our accompanying management systems frequently go beyond country or industrylevel guidelines to ensure that we keep our employees healthy and safe we also host regulatory visits that focus on issues such as safety radiation fire codes food and transportation through our environment health and safety “ehs” management systems we ensure that the focus remains on the continuous improvement and provide comprehensive health and safety training to our employees we emphasize elearning courses as our main vehicle for delivering such training because employees can learn at their own pace in response to the covid19 pandemic and to protect the health and wellbeing of our employees customers suppliers and the communities in which we operate we implemented significant safety protocols over the past two and a half 

years we continue to ensure that our covid19 pandemic protocols remain in place as needed to ensure the health and safety of our employees we continue to monitor the impact of the covid19 pandemic and adjust these measures over time as appropriate to protect the health and wellbeing of our employees customers suppliers and communities 

development retention compensation benefits  engagement our performance management system is a continuous process that helps team members focus on the right priorities meaningful conversations between managers and employees are the foundation of performance management at seagate we focus on dialogue centered around manager and employee conversations and ongoing feedback to align goals this approach focuses on achieving highquality productive dialogue between managers and employees we also encourage our employees to participate in the many learning opportunities that are available at seagate the portfolio of learning and training formats include but are not limited to mentoring and coaching elearning opportunities linkedin learning classroom training onthejob training and other strategic internal programs that cover topics ranging from leadership and technical skills to health safety and the environment in addition we are investing in upskilling and redeploying employees as needed to support our future growth and respond to the changing demands of the business for example our internal mobility and career development tool provides seagate employees the opportunity to establish networking and mentor connections identify and participate in internal parttime projects and explore internal fulltime positions 

our total rewards program is designed to attract motivate and retain talented people in order to successfully meet our business goals the program includes base pay annual bonuses commissions equity awards an employee share purchasing plan retirement savings opportunities and other employee health and wellness benefits our compensation programs and guidelines are structured to align pay with performance and aim to provide internally and externally competitive total compensation 

employee engagement is the psychological commitment and passion that drives discretionary effort it predicts individual performance and is the measure of the relationship between employees and the company our engagement survey includes facets of the employee experience throughout the employee life cycle employee experience is what employees encounter and observe over the course of their career at seagate a positive employee experience can have an impact on everything from recruiting to seagates bottom line 

in our fiscal year 2022 survey 92 of our global employees shared their feedback on their experience at seagate following the conclusion of the survey leaders were provided access to a dashboard with results that shared the key drivers of engagement specific to their own department leaders were asked to follow our “review share and take action” process to analyze their results share and discuss with their teams and create customized action plans designed to have the greatest impact on engagement for a particular department 

giving back our community engagement program is designed to provide support to our local communities with an emphasis on science technology engineering and mathematics “stem” and also address health and human services and environmental opportunities the program is reflective of seagate’s vertically integrated model with multiple large facilities across emea asia and the united states accordingly the program is highly localized involving a crossfunctional process to identify and execute on opportunities that are meaningful locally 

in general we maintain an emphasis on stem targeting k12 students supporting stem efforts in a way that is ageappropriate and allows for fun as well as learning in fiscal year 2022 due to the covid19 pandemic seagate pivoted to virtual engagements and funding of stem partners as they worked to deliver their programs online or in a socially distanced manner seagate also increased support of health  human services partnerships due to the pandemic such as support of food banks clinics and nonprofit organizations providing covid19 pandemic health care and relief while sustaining many of our ongoing community partnerships

risks related to our business operations and industry 

our ability to increase our revenue and maintain our market share depends on our ability to successfully introduce and achieve market acceptance of new products on a timely basis if our products do not keep pace with customer requirements our results of operations will be adversely affected 

the markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product introductions and technology enhancements uncertain product life cycles and changes in customer demand the success of our products and services also often depends on whether our offerings are compatible with our customers’ or thirdparties’ products or services and their changing technologies our customers demand new generations of storage products as advances in computer hardware and software have created the need for improved storage with features such as increased storage capacity enhanced security energy efficiency improved performance and reliability and lower cost we and our competitors have developed improved products and we will need to continue to do so in the future 

historically our results of operations have substantially depended upon our ability to be among the firsttomarket with new data storage product offerings we may face technological operational and financial challenges in developing new products in addition our investments in new product development may not yield the anticipated benefits our market share revenue and results of operations in the future may be adversely affected if we fail to 

• develop new products identify business strategies and timely introduce competitive product offerings to meet technological shifts or we are unable to execute successfully 

• consistently maintain our timetomarket performance with our new products 

• produce these products in adequate volume 

• meet specifications or satisfy compatibility requirements 

• qualify these products with key customers on a timely basis by meeting our customers’ performance and quality specifications or 

• achieve acceptable manufacturing yields quality and costs with these products 

accordingly we cannot accurately determine the ultimate effect that our new products will have on our results of operations our failure to accurately anticipate customers’ needs and accurately identify the shift in technological changes could materially adversely affect our longterm financial results 

in addition the concentration of customers in our largest end markets magnifies the potential effect of missing a product qualification opportunity if the delivery of our products is delayed our customers may use our competitors’ products to meet their requirements 

when we develop new products with higher capacity and more advanced technology our results of operations may decline because the increased difficulty and complexity associated with producing these products increases the likelihood of reliability quality or operability problems if our products experience increases in failure rates are of low quality or are not reliable customers may reduce their purchases of our products our factory utilization may decrease and our manufacturing rework and scrap costs and our service and warranty costs may increase in addition a decline in the reliability of our products may make it more difficult for us to effectively compete with our competitors 

additionally we may be unable to produce new products that have higher capacities and more advanced technologies in the volumes and timeframes that are required to meet customer demand we are transitioning to key areal density recording technologies that use hamr technology to increase hdd capacities if our transitions to more advanced technologies including the transition to hdds utilizing hamr technology require development and production cycles that are longer than anticipated or if we otherwise fail to implement new hdd technologies successfully we may lose sales and market share which could significantly harm our financial results 

we cannot assure you that we will be among the leaders in timetomarket with new products or that we will be able to successfully qualify new products with our customers in the future if our new products are not successful our future results of operations may be adversely affected 

we operate in highly competitive markets and our failure to anticipate and respond to technological changes and other market developments including price could harm our ability to compete 

we face intense competition in the data storage industry our principal sources of competition include hdd and ssd manufacturers and companies that provide storage subsystems including electronic manufacturing services and contract electronic manufacturing 

the markets for our data storage products are characterized by technological change which is driven in part by the adoption of new industry standards these standards provide mechanisms to ensure technology component interoperability but they also hinder our ability to innovate or differentiate our products when this occurs our products may be deemed commodities which could result in downward pressure on prices 

we also experience competition from other companies that produce alternative storage technologies such as flash memory where increasing capacity decreasing cost energy efficiency and improvements in performance have resulted in increased competition with our lower capacity smaller form factor disk drives and a declining trend in demand for hdds in our legacy markets some customers for both mass capacity storage and legacy markets hav e adopted ssds as an alternative to hard drives in certain applications further adoption of ssds or other alternative storage technologies may limit our total addressable hdd market impact the competitiveness of our product portfolio and reduce our market share any resulting increase in competition could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations  

we may be adversely affected by the loss of or reduced delayed or canceled purchases by one or more of our key customers  

some of our key customer s such as oem customers including large hyperscale data center companies and csps account for a large portion of our reven ue in our mass capacity markets while we have longstanding relationships with many of our customers if any key customers were to significantly reduce defer or cancel their purchases from us or delay product acceptances or we were prohibited from selling to those key customers our results of operations would be adversely affected although sales to key customers may vary from period to period a key customer that permanently discontinues or significantly reduces its relationship with us or that we are prohibited from selling to could be difficult to replace in line with industry practice new key customers usually require that we pass a lengthy and rigorous qualification process accordingly it may be difficult or costly for us to attract new key customers  conversely if one of our key customers unexpectedly increases its orders we may be unable to produce the additional product volumes in a timely manner or take advantage of any overall increased market demand this could damage our customer relationships and reputation which may adversely affect our results of operations additionally some of our key customers are subject to cyclical demand which may result in variability of their orders and timing of their purchase with us and if one of our key customers unexpectedly reduces delays or cancels orders our revenues and results of operations may be adversely affected  

furthermore if there is consolidation among our customer base our customers may be able to command increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale which could adversely affect our profitability furthermore if such customer pressures require us to reduce our pricing such that our gross margins are diminished it might not be feasible to sell to a particular customer which could result in a decrease in our revenue consolidation among our customer base may also lead to reduced demand for our products replacement of our products by the combined entity with those of our competitors and cancellations of orders each of which could adversely affect our results of operations if a significant transaction or regulatory impact involving any of our key customers results in the loss of or reduction in purchases by these key customers it could have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition  

we are dependent on sales to distributors and retailers which may increase price erosion and the volatility of our sales  

a substantial portion of our sales has been to distributors and retailers of disk drive products certain of our distributors and retailers may also market competing products we face significant competition in this distribution channel as a result of limited product qualification programs and a focus on price terms and product availability sales volumes through this channel are also less predictable and subject to greater volatility in addition deterioration in business and economic conditions could exacerbate price erosion and volatility as distributors or retailers lower prices to compensate for lower demand and higher inventory levels our distributors’ and retailers’ ability to access credit to fund their operations may also affect their purchases of our products if prices decline significantly in this distribution channel or our distributors or retailers reduce purchases of our products or if distributors or retailers experience financial difficulties or terminate their relationships with us our revenues and results of operations would be adversely affected 

we must plan our investments in our products and incur costs before we have customer orders or know about the market conditions at the time the products are produced if we fail to predict demand accurately for our products or if the markets for our products change we may be unable to meet demand or we may have insufficient demand which may materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our manufacturing process requires us to make significant productspecific investments in inventory for production at least three to six months in advance as a result we incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales that may never materialize or that may be substantially lower than expected if actual demand for our products is lower than the forecast we may also experience higher inventory carrying costs manufacturing rework costs and product obsolescence conversely if we underestimate demand we may have insufficient inventory to satisfy demand and may have to forego sales  

other factors that have affected and may continue to affect our ability to anticipate or meet the demand for our products and adversely affect our results of operations include 

• competitive product announcements or technological advances that result in excess supply when customers cancel purchases in anticipation of newer products 

• variable demand resulting from unanticipated upward or downward pricing pressures 

• our ability to successfully qualify manufacture and sell our data storage products 

• changes in our product mix which may adversely affect our gross margins 

• key customers deferring or canceling purchases or delaying product acceptances or unexpected increases in their orders 

• manufacturing delays or interruptions particularly at our manufacturing facilities in china malaysia northern ireland singapore thailand or the united states 

• limited access to components that we obtain from a single or a limited number of suppliers and 

• the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the cost of producing our products and the effective price of our products to nonus customers 

changes in demand for computer systems data storage subsystems and consumer electronic devices may in the future cause a decline in demand for our products or an increase in demand for our products that we are unable to meet 

our products are components in computers data storage systems and consumer electronic devices historically the demand for these products has been volatile unexpected slowdowns in demand for computers data storage subsystems or consumer electronic devices generally result in sharp declines in demand for our products declines in customer spending on the systems and devices that incorporate our products could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and on our financial condition and results of operations uncertain global economic and business conditions can exacerbate these risks 

we are dependent on our longterm investments to manufacture adequate products our investment decisions in adding new assembly and test capacity require significant planning and leadtime and a failure to accurately forecast demand for our products could cause us to overinvest or underinvest which would lead to excess capacity underutilization charges impairments or loss of sales and revenue opportunities 

sales to the legacy markets remain an important part of our business these markets however have been and we expect them to continue to be adversely affected by 

• announcements or introductions of major new operating systems or semiconductor improvements or shifts in customer preferences performance requirements and behavior such as the shift to tablet computers smart phones nand flash memory or similar devices that meet customers’ cost and capacity metrics 

• longer product life cycles and 

• changes in macroeconomic conditions that cause customers to spend less such as the imposition of new tariffs increased laws and regulations and increased unemployment levels 

we believe that the deterioration of demand for disk drives in certain of the legacy markets has accelerated and this deterioration may continue or further accelerate which could cause our operating results to suffer 

in addition we believe announcements regarding competitive product introductions from time to time have caused customers to defer or cancel their purchases making certain inventory obsolete whenever an oversupply of products in the market causes our industry to have higher than anticipated inventory levels we experience even more intense price competition from other manufacturers than usual which may materially adversely affect our financial results 

we have a long and unpredictable sales cycle for nearline storage solutions which impairs our ability to accurately predict our financial and operating results in any period and may adversely affect our ability to forecast the need for investments and expenditures  

our nearline storage solutions are technically complex and we typically supply them in high quantities to a small number of customers many of our products are also tailored to meet the specific requirements of individual customers and are often integrated by our customers into the systems and products that they sell factors that affect the length of our sales cycle include 

• the time required for developing testing and evaluating our products before they are deployed 

• the size of the deployment and 

• the complexity of system configuration necessary to deploy our products 

as a result our sales cycle for nearline storage solutions could exceed one year and frequently unpredictable additionally our nearline storage solutions is subject to variability of sales primarily due to the timing of it spending or a reflection of cyclical demand from csps based on the timing of their procurement and deployment requirements and their ability to procure other components needed to build out data center infrastructure given the length of development and qualification programs and unpredictability of the sales cycle we may be unable to accurately forecast product demand which may result in lost sales or excess inventory and associated inventory reserves or writedowns each of which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we experience seasonal declines in the sales of our consumer products during the second half of our fiscal year which may adversely affect our results of operations 

in certain end markets sales of computers storage subsystems and consumer electronic devices tend to be seasonal and therefore we expect to continue to experience seasonality in our business as we respond to variations in our customers’ demand for our products in particular we anticipate that sales of our consumer products will continue to be lower during the second half of our fiscal year retail sales of certain of our legacy markets solutions traditionally experience higher demand in the first half of our fiscal year driven by consumer spending in the backtoschool season from late summer to fall and the traditional holiday shopping season from fall to winter we experience seasonal reductions in the second half of our fiscal year in the business activities of our customers during international holidays like lunar new year as well as in the summer months particularly in europe which typically result in lower sales during those periods since our working capital needs peak during periods in which we are increasing production in anticipation of orders that have not yet been received our results of operations will fluctuate even if the forecasted demand for our products proves accurate failure to anticipate consumer demand for our branded solutions as well as an inability to maintain effective working relationships with retail and online distributors may also adversely impact our future results of operations  furthermore it is difficult for us to evaluate the degree to which this seasonality may affect our business in future periods because of the rate and unpredictability of product transitions and new product introductions as well as macroeconomic conditions 

we may not be successful in our efforts to grow our systems ssd and lyve revenues 

we have made and continue to make investments to grow our systems ssd and lyve platform revenues our ability to grow systems ssd and lyve revenues is subject to the following risks 

• we may be unable to accurately estimate and predict data center capacity and requirements 

• we may not be able to offer compelling solutions or services to enterprises subscribers or consumers 

• we may be unable to obtain cost effective supply of nand flash memory in order to offer competitive ssd solutions and 

• our cloud systems revenues generally have a longer sales cycle and growth is likely to depend on relatively large customer orders which may increase the variability of our results of operations and the difficulty of matching revenues with expenses 

our results of operations and share price may be adversely affected if we are not successful in our efforts to grow our revenues as anticipated in addition our growth in these markets may bring us into closer competition with some of our customers or potential customers which may decrease their willingness to do business with us 

our worldwide sales operations subject us to risks that may adversely affect our business related to disruptions in international markets currency exchange fluctuations increased costs and global health outbreaks  

we are a global company and have significant sales operations outside of the united states including sales personnel and customer support operations we also generate a significant portion of our revenue from sales outside the us disruptions in the economic environmental political legal or regulatory landscape in the countries where we operate may have a material adverse impact on our manufacturing and sales operations disruptions in financial markets the deterioration of global economic conditions and geopolitical uncertainty and instability or war such as the military action against ukraine launched by russia have had and may continue to have an impact on our sales to customers and endusers located in the emea region 

prices for our products are denominated predominantly in dollars even when sold to customers that are located outside the us an increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside of the us where we sell in dollars this could adversely impact our sales and market share in such areas or increase pressure on us to lower our price and adversely impact our profit margins in addition we have revenue and expenses denominated in currencies other than the dollar primarily the thai baht singaporean dollar chinese renminbi and british pound sterling which further exposes us to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates a weakened dollar could increase the effective cost of our expenses such as payroll utilities tax and marketing expenses as well as overseas capital expenditures any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations we have attempted to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes by among other things entering into foreign currency forward exchange contracts from time to time which could be designated as cash flow hedges or not designated as hedging instruments our hedging strategy may be ineffective and specific hedges may expire and not be renewed or may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations the hedging activities may not cover our full exposure subject us to certain counterparty credit risks and may impact our results of operations see “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk— foreign currency exchange risk ” of this report for additional information about our foreign currency exchange risk 

the shipping and transportation costs associated with our international operations are typically higher than those associated with our us operations resulting in decreased operating margins in some countries volatility in fuel costs political instability or constraints in or increases in the costs of air transportation may lead us to develop alternative shipment methods which could disrupt our ability to receive raw materials or ship finished product and as a result our business and results of operations may be harmed 

the occurrence of a pandemic disease such as the recent covid19 pandemic has impacted and may adversely impact our operations including without limitation logistical and other operational costs and the operations of some of our customers 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic has impacted our business operating results and financial condition  as well as the operations and financial performance of many of the customers and suppliers in industries that we serve we are unable to predict the extent to which the pandemic and related effects will adversely impact our business operations financial performance results of operations financial position and the achievement of our strategic objectives  

the covid19 pandemic has resulted in a widespread health crisis and numerous disease control measures being taken to limit its spread the impact of the pandemic on our business has included or could in the future include 

• disruptions to or restrictions on our ability to ensure the continuous manufacture and supply of our products and services including insufficiency of our existing inventory levels and temporary or permanent closures or reductions in operational capacity of our facilities or the facilities of our direct or indirect suppliers or customers and any supply chain disruptions 

• temporary shortages of skilled employees available to staff manufacturing facilities due to stay at home orders and travel restrictions within as well as into and out of countries 

• increases in operational expenses and other costs related to requirements implemented to mitigate the impact of the covid19 pandemic 

• delays or limitations on the ability of our customers to perform or make timely payments 

• reductions in short and longterm demand for our products or other disruptions in technology buying patterns 

• adverse effects on economies and financial markets globally or in various markets throughout the world potentially leading to a prolonged economic downturn or reductions in business and consumer spending which may result in decreased net revenue gross margins or earnings andor in increased expenses and difficulty in managing inventory levels 

• delays to andor lengthening of our sales or development cycles or qualification activity 

• challenges for us our direct and indirect suppliers and our customers in obtaining financing due to turmoil in financial markets 

• workforce disruptions due to illness quarantines governmental actions other restrictions andor the social distancing measures we have taken to mitigate the impact of the covid19 pandemic in an effort to protect the health and wellbeing of our employees customers suppliers and of the communities in which we operate 

• increased vulnerability to cyberattacks due to the significant number of employees working remotely and 

• our management team continuing to commit significant time attention and resources to monitoring the covid19 pandemic and seeking to mitigate its effects on our business and workforce 

the covid19 pandemic has increased economic and demand uncertainty it continues to affect our business in both positive and negative ways and there is uncertainty around its duration and impact the ultimate extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments including the impact of any virus mutations or new strains of covid19 virus and the distribution and efficacy of the vaccine which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time these impacts individually or in the aggregate could have a material and adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition such effect may be exacerbated in the event the pandemic and the measures taken in response to it and their effects persist for an extended period of time or if there is a resurgence of the outbreak or variants thereof under any of these circumstances the resumption of normal business operations may be delayed or hampered by lingering effects of the covid19 pandemic on our operations direct and indirect suppliers partners and customers the covid19 pandemic may also heighten other risks described in this risk factors section 

if we do not control our costs we will not be able to compete effectively  

we continually seek to make our cost structure and business processes more efficient we are focused on increasing workforce flexibility and scalability and improving overall competitiveness by leveraging our global capabilities as well as external talent and skills worldwide our strategy involves to a substantial degree increasing revenue and exabytes volume while at the same time controlling expenses because our vertical design and manufacturing strategy our operations have higher costs that are fixed or difficult to reduce in the shortterm including our costs related to utilization of existing facilities and equipment if we fail to forecast demand accurately or if there is a partial or complete reduction in longterm demand for our products we could be required to write off inventory record excess capacity charges which could negatively impact our gross margin and our financial results if we do not control our manufacturing and operating expenses our ability to compete in the marketplace may be impaired in the past activities to reduce costs have included closures and transfers of facilities significant personnel reductions restructuring efforts and efforts to increase automation our restructuring efforts may not yield the intended benefits and may be unsuccessful or disruptive to our business operations which may materially adversely affect our financial results  

risks associated with supply and manufacturing 

shortages or delays in the receipt of or cost increases in critical components equipment or raw materials necessary to manufacture our products may cause us to suffer lower operating margins production delays and other material adverse effects 

the cost quality availability and supply of components subassemblies certain equipment and raw materials used to manufacture our products and key components like recording media and heads are critical to our success particularly important for our products are components such as readwrite heads substrates for recording media asics spindle motors printed circuit boards suspension assemblies and nand flash memory in addition the equipment we use to manufacture our products and components is frequently custom made and comes from a few suppliers and the lead times required to obtain manufacturing equipment can be significant our efforts to control our costs including capital expenditures may also affect our ability to obtain or maintain such inputs and equipment which could affect our ability to meet future demand for our products 

we rely on sole or a limited number of direct and indirect suppliers for some or all of these components that we do not manufacture including substrates for recording media readwrite heads asics spindle motors printed circuit boards suspension assemblies and nand flash memory in light of this small consolidated supplier base if our suppliers increased their prices as a result of inflationary pressures from the current macroeconomic conditions or other changes in economic conditions our results of operations would be negatively affected also many of such direct and indirect component suppliers are geographically concentrated making our supply chain more vulnerable to regional disruptions such as severe weather the occurrence of local or global health issues or pandemics acts of terrorism war and an unpredictable geopolitical climate which may have a material impact on the production availability and transportation of many components we have experienced and continue to experience disruptions in our supply chain due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic which has also impacted and may adversely impact our operations including without limitation logistical and other operational costs and the operations of some of our key direct and indirect suppliers if our direct and indirect vendors for these components are unable to meet our cost quality supply and transportation requirements continue to remain financially viable or fulfill their contractual commitments and obligations we could experience disruption in our supply chain including shortages in supply or increases in production costs which would materially adversely affect our results of operations the current worldwide shortage of semiconductors exacerbates these risks 

certain rare earth elements are critical in the manufacture of our products we purchase components that contain rare earth elements from a number of countries including china we cannot predict whether any nation will impose regulations or trade barriers including tariffs duties quotas or embargoes upon the rare earth elements incorporated into our products that would restrict the worldwide supply of such metals or increase their cost we have experienced and continuing to experience increased costs and production delays when we were unable to obtain the necessary equipment or sufficient quantities of some components andor have been forced to pay higher prices or make volume purchase commitments or advance deposits for some components equipment or raw materials that were in short supply in the industry in general further if our customers experience shortages of components or materials used in their products it could result in a decrease in demand for our products and have an adverse effect on our results of operations if any major supplier were to restrict the supply available to us or increase the cost of the rare earth elements used in our products we could experience a shortage in supply or an increase in production costs which would adversely affect our results of operations 

shortages or delays in critical components as well as reliance on singlesource suppliers can affect our production and development of products and may harm our operating results  

we are dependent on a limited number of qualified suppliers who provide critical materials or components if there is a shortage of or delay in supplying us with critical components equipment or raw materials then  

• it is likely that our suppliers would raise their prices and if we could not pass these price increases to our customers our operating margin would decline 

• we may have to reengineer some products which would likely cause production and shipment delays make the reengineered products more costly and provide us with a lower rate of return on these products 

• we would likely have to allocate the components we receive to certain of our products and ship less of others which could reduce our revenues and could cause us to lose sales to customers who could purchase more of their required products from manufacturers that either did not experience these shortages or delays or that made different allocations and 

• we may be late in shipping products causing potential customers to make purchases from our competitors thus causing our revenue and operating margin to decline 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain critical components in a timely and economic manner the industry is currently experiencing a global shortage of semiconductors and other electronic components in addition many of our suppliers’ manufacturing facilities are fully utilized if they fail to invest in additional capacity or deliver components in the required timeframe such failure would have an impact on our ability to ramp new products and may result in a loss of revenue or market share if our competitors did not utilize the same components and were not affected  

we often aim to lead the market in new technology deployments and leverage unique and customized technology from single source suppliers who are early adopters in the emerging market our options in supplier selection in these cases are limited and the supplier based technology has been and may continue to be single sourced until wider adoption of the technology occurs and any necessary licenses become available in such cases any technical issues in the supplier’s technology may cause us to delay shipments of our new technology deployments and harm our financial position  

if revenues fall or customer demand decreases significantly we may not meet all of our purchase commitments to certain suppliers  

from time to time we enter into longterm noncancelable purchase commitments or make large upfront investments with certain suppliers in order to secure certain components or technologies for the production of our products or to supplement our internal manufacturing capacity for certain components if our actual revenues in the future are lower than our projections or if customer demand decreases significantly below our projections we may not meet all of our purchase commitments with these suppliers as a result it is possible that our revenues will not be sufficient to recoup our upfront investments in which case we will have to shift output from our internal manufacturing facilities to these suppliers or make penaltytype payments under the terms of these contracts additionally because our markets are volatile competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes we face inventory and other asset risks in the event we do not fully utilize purchase commitments if we are unable to fully utilize our purchase commitments or if we shift output from our internal manufacturing facilities in order to meet the commitments our gross margin and operating margin could be materially adversely impacted 

due to the complexity of our products some defects may only become detectable after deployment  

our products are highly complex and are designed to operate in and form part of larger complex networks and storage systems our products may contain a defect or be perceived as containing a defect by our customers as a result of improper use or maintenance lead times required to manufacture certain components are significant and a quality excursion may take significant time and resources to remediate defects in our products thirdparty components or in the networks and systems of which they form a part directly or indirectly have resulted in and may in the future result in  

• increased costs and product delays until complex solution level interoperability issues are resolved 

• costs associated with the remediation of any problems attributable to our products 

• loss of or delays in revenues 

• loss of customers 

• failure to achieve market acceptance and loss of market share 

• increased service and warranty costs and 

• increased insurance costs 

defects in our products could also result in legal actions by our customers for breach of warranty property damage injury or death such legal actions including but not limited to product liability claims could exceed the level of insurance coverage that we have obtained any significant uninsured claims could significantly harm our financial condition  

risks related to human capital 

the loss of or inability to attract retain and motivate key executive officers and employees could negatively impact our business prospects  

our future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued service of key members of management as well as marketing sales and product development personnel we believe our future success will also depend in large part upon our ability to attract retain and further motivate highly skilled management marketing sales and product development personnel we have experienced intense competition for qualified and capable personnel including in the us thailand china singapore and northern ireland and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our key employees or that we will be successful in attracting assimilating and retaining personnel in the future additionally because a portion of our key personnel’s compensation is contingent upon the performance of our business including through cash bonuses and equity compensation when the market price of our ordinary shares fluctuates or our results of operations or financial condition are negatively impacted we may be at a competitive disadvantage for retaining and hiring employees the reductions in workforce that result from our historical restructurings have also made and may continue to make it difficult for us to recruit and retain personnel increased difficulty in accessing recruiting or retaining personnel may lead to increased manufacturing and employment compensation costs which could adversely affect our results of operations the loss of one or more of our key personnel or the inability to hire and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to risks related to corporate and social responsibility and reputation 

many factors influence our reputation including the perception held by our customers suppliers partners shareholders other key stakeholders and the communities in which we operate we face increasing scrutiny related to environmental social and governance activities we risk damage to our reputation if we fail to act responsibly in a number of areas such as diversity and inclusion environmental stewardship sustainability supply chain management climate change workplace conduct and human rights any harm to our reputation could impact employee engagement and retention our corporate culture and the willingness of customers suppliers and partners to do business with us which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows further despite our policies to the contrary we may not be able to control the conduct of every individual actor and our employees and personnel may violate environmental social or governance standards or engage in other unethical conduct these acts or any accusation of such conduct even if proven to be false could adversely impact the reputation of our business 

risks related to financial performance or general economic conditions 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations and our investments to meet our liquidity requirements including servicing our indebtedness  

our business may not generate sufficient cash flows to enable us to meet our liquidity requirements including working capital capital expenditures product development efforts investments servicing our indebtedness and other general corporate requirements if we cannot fund our liquidity requirements we may have to reduce or delay capital expenditures product development efforts investments and other general corporate expenditures we cannot assure you that any of these remedies would if necessary be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all or that they would permit us to meet our obligations which would affect our results of operations 

we are leveraged and require significant amounts of cash to service our debt our debt and debt service requirements could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities and reduce our options for capital allocation our high level of debt presents the following risks 

• we are required to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements 

• our substantial leverage increases our vulnerability to economic downturns decreased availability of capital and adverse competitive and industry conditions and could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that are less leveraged 

• our debt service obligations could limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry and could limit our ability to pursue other business opportunities borrow more money for operations or capital in the future and implement our business strategies 

• our level of debt may restrict us from raising or make it more costly to raise additional financing on satisfactory terms to fund working capital capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements and 

• covenants in our debt instruments limit our ability to pay future dividends or make other restricted payments and investments 

in addition in the event that we need to refinance all or a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures or incur additional debt to fund our operations we may not be able to obtain terms as favorable as the terms of our existing debt or refinance our existing debt or incur additional debt to fund our operations at all if prevailing interest rates or other factors result in higher interest rates upon refinancing then the interest expense relating to the refinanced debt would increase furthermore if any rating agency changes our credit rating or outlook our debt and equity securities could be negatively affected which could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt or raise additional capital  

we are subject to counterparty default risks 

we have numerous arrangements with financial institutions that subject us to counterparty default risks including cash and investment deposits and foreign currency forward exchange contracts and other derivative instruments as a result we are subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these arrangements will voluntarily or involuntarily default on its performance obligations in times of market distress in particular a counterparty may not comply with its contractual commitments that could then lead to it defaulting on its obligations with little or no notice to us thereby limiting our ability to take action to lessen or cover our exposure additionally our ability to mitigate our counterparty exposures could be limited by the terms of the relevant agreements or because market conditions prevent us from taking effective action if one of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy our ability to recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterpartys default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty or the applicable laws governing the bankruptcy proceedings in the event of any such counterparty default we could incur significant losses which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

further our customers could have reduced access to working capital due to global economic conditions higher interest rates reduced bank lending resulting from contractions in the money supply or the deterioration in the customer’s or their bank’s financial condition or the inability to access other financing which would increase our credit and nonpayment risk and could result in an increase in our operating costs or a reduction in our revenue also our customers outside of the united states are sometimes allowed longer time periods for payment than our us customers this increases the risk of nonpayment due to the possibility that the financial condition of particular customers may worsen during the course of the payment period in addition some of our oem customers have adopted a subcontractor model that requires us to contract directly with companies such as original design manufacturers that provide manufacturing and fulfillment services to our oem customers because these subcontractors are generally not as well capitalized as our direct oem customers this subcontractor model exposes us to increased credit risks our agreements with our oem customers may not permit us to increase our product prices to alleviate this increased credit risk 

our quarterly results of operations fluctuate sometimes significantly from period to period and may cause our share price to decline  

our quarterly revenue and results of operations fluctuate sometimes significantly from period to period these fluctuations which we expect to continue have been and may continue to be precipitated by a variety of factors including 

• uncertainty in global economic and political conditions and instability or war such as the military action against ukraine launched by russia or adverse changes in the level of economic activity in the major regions in which we do business 

• pandemics such as covid19 or other global health issues that impact our operations as well as those of our customers and suppliers 

• competitive pressures resulting in lower prices by our competitors which may shift demand away from our products 

• announcements of new products services or technological innovations by us or our competitors and delays or problems in our introduction of new more costeffective products the inability to achieve high production yields or delays in customer qualification or initial product quality issues 

• changes in customer demand or the purchasing patterns or behavior of our customers 

• application of new or revised industry standards 

• disruptions in our supply chain including increased costs or adverse changes in availability of supplies of raw materials or components 

• increased costs of electricity andor other energy sources freight and logistics costs or other materials or services necessary for the operation of our business 

• the impact of corporate restructuring activities that we have and may continue to engage in 

• changes in the demand for the computer systems and data storage products that contain our products 

• unfavorable supply and demand imbalances 

• our high proportion of fixed costs including manufacturing and research and development expenses 

• any impairments in goodwill or other longlived assets 

• changes in tax laws such as global tax developments applicable to multinational businesses the impact of trade barriers such as importexport duties and restrictions sanctions tariffs and quotas imposed by the us or other countries in which the company conducts business 

• the evolving legal and regulatory economic environmental and administrative climate in the international markets where the company operates and 

• adverse changes in the performance of our products 

as a result we believe that quartertoquarter and yearoveryear comparisons of our revenue and results of operations may not be meaningful and that these comparisons may not be an accurate indicator of our future performance our results of operations in one or more future quarters may fail to meet the expectations of investment research analysts or investors which could cause an immediate and significant decline in our market value 

any cost reduction initiatives that we undertake may not deliver the results we expect and these actions may adversely affect our business  

from time to time we engage in restructuring plans that have resulted and may continue to result in workforce reduction and consolidation of our real estate facilities and our manufacturing footprint in addition management will continue to evaluate our global footprint and cost structure and additional restructuring plans are expected to be formalized as a result of our restructurings we have experienced and may in the future experience a loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge disruptions to our operations and inefficiency during transitional periods additionally global footprint consolidation and reduction in excess capacity may result in us being unable to respond to increases in forecasted volume of customer demand and loss of revenue opportunity if our competitors have underutilized factories any costcutting measures could impact employee retention in addition we cannot be sure that any future cost reductions or global footprint consolidations will deliver the results we expect be successful in reducing our overall expenses as we expect or that additional costs will not offset any such reductions or global footprint consolidation if our operating costs are higher than we expect or if we do not maintain adequate control of our costs and expenses our results of operations may be adversely affected 

changes in the macroeconomic environment may in the future negatively impact our results of operations 

changes in macroeconomic conditions may affect consumer and enterprise spending and as a result our customers may postpone or cancel spending in response to volatility in credit and equity markets negative financial news andor declines in income or asset values all of which may have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products andor result in significant decreases in our product prices other factors that could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and on our financial condition and results of operations include inflation slower growth or recession conditions in the labor market healthcare costs access to credit consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer and business spending behavior 

macroeconomic developments such as the withdrawal of the united kingdom “uk” from the european union “eu” slowing global economies increased tariffs between the us and china mexico and other countries or adverse economic conditions worldwide resulting from the covid19 pandemic and efforts of governments and private industry to slow the pandemic or efforts of governments to stimulate or stabilize the economy may adversely impact our business for example significant inflation and related increases in interest rates or a recession could negatively affect our business operating results or financial condition or the markets in which we operate which in turn could adversely affect the price of our ordinary shares a general weakening of and related declining corporate confidence in the global economy or the curtailment in government or corporate spending could cause current or potential customers to reduce their information technology “it” budgets or be unable to fund data storage systems which could cause customers to delay decrease or cancel purchases of our products or cause customers not to pay us or to delay paying us for previously purchased products and services  

the effect of geopolitical uncertainties war terrorism natural disasters public health issues and other circumstances on national andor international commerce and on the global economy could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition  

geopolitical uncertainty terrorism instability or war such as the military action against ukraine launched by russia natural disasters public health issues and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy and thus could have a strong negative effect on our business our direct and indirect suppliers logistics providers manufacturing vendors and customers our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes fires power or water shortages terrorist attacks other hostile acts labor disputes public health issues such as the covid19 pandemic and related mitigation actions and other events beyond our control such events may decrease demand for our products make it difficult or impossible for us to make and deliver products to our customers or to receive components from our direct and indirect suppliers and create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain 

a significant natural disaster such as an earthquake fire flood or significant power outage could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition the impact of climate change may increase these risks due to changes in weather patterns such as increases in storm intensity sealevel rise melting of permafrost and temperature extremes in areas where we or our suppliers and customers conduct business we have a number of our employees and executive officers located in the san francisco bay area a region known for seismic activity wildfires and drought conditions and in asia near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity to mitigate wildfire risk electric utilities are deploying public safety power shutoffs which affects electricity reliability to our facilities and our communities many of our suppliers and customers are also located in areas with risks of natural disasters for example many of our component suppliers are geographically concentrated in thailand which suffered severe flooding in october 2011 resulting in a material impact on the production and availability of many components which caused significant increases in the cost of components in the event of a natural disaster losses and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected further governmental regulations related to the environment such as singapore’s recent adoption of a law restricting data center development may also adversely affect our customers or our introduction of new products or services resulting in adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations 

should major public health issues including pandemics arise we could be negatively affected by stringent employee travel restrictions additional limitations or cost increases in freight and other logistical services governmental actions limiting the movement of products or employees between regions increases in or changes to data collection and reporting obligations delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in our operations and those of some of our key direct and indirect suppliers and customers for example the recent covid19 pandemic resulted in governmentimposed travel restrictions border closures stayathome orders facility closures or operating constraints in a number of our global locations disruptions in our operations and those of our suppliers partners and customers increases in air freight rates limited numbers of employees available to staff manufacturing operations and shortages of supplies of personal protective equipment required for our manufacturing operations if any of these circumstances continue for an extended period of time our manufacturing ability and capacity or those of our key direct and indirect suppliers or customers could be impacted and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

legal regulatory and compliance risks 

our business is subject to various laws regulations governmental policies litigation governmental investigations or governmental proceedings that may cause us to incur significant expense or adversely impact our results or operations and financial condition  

our business is subject to regulation under a wide variety of us federal and state and nonus laws regulations and policies there can be no assurance that laws regulations and policies will not be changed in ways that will require us to modify our business model and objectives or affect our returns on investments by restricting existing activities and products subjecting them to escalating costs or prohibiting them outright in particular governmental focus on antitrust and competition law improper payments the environment data privacy protection security and sovereignty currency exchange controls conflict minerals import and export controls complex economic sanctions and potential further changes to global tax laws and tax laws in any jurisdiction in which we operate have had and may continue to have an effect on our business corporate structure operations sales liquidity capital requirements effective tax rate results of operations and financial performance china malaysia northern ireland singapore and thailand in which we have significant operating assets and the european union each have exercised and continue to exercise significant influence over many aspects of their domestic economies including but not limited to fair competition tax practices anticorruption antitrust data privacy protection security and sovereignty price controls and international trade 

our business is subject to state federal and international laws and regulations relating to data privacy data protection and data security involving matters including data use data localization data transfer data storage data retention and deletion data access and the protection of data and systems compliance with these laws and regulations can be onerous and have increased and may continue to increase our cost of doing business globally or otherwise adversely impact financial results our introduction of new products or services changes to our existing products or services or the manner in which our customers utilize our products or services may result in new or enhanced costly compliance requirements or governmental or regulatory scrutiny that could adversely affect our business and financial results data privacy and data protection regulations also continue to change and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may adversely affect our business by requiring changes to our business practices limiting our ability to offer a product or service or making our products or services less attractive to customers laws and regulations related to data transfers including data localization data access and data storage also continue to develop and have been subject to regulatory and judicial scrutiny in many cases these laws apply to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries and among us our subsidiaries and our customers or other parties with which we have commercial relations if we are restricted in our sharing of data among countries and regions in which we operate among our subsidiaries or with third parties with which we have a commercial relationship it may increase our compliance costs and adversely impact our operations the ability to provide our products or services or the manner in which we provide our product or services our business is subject to state federal and international laws and regulations that subject us to requirements to notify vendors customers or employees of a data security breach any actual or perceived data security breach or incident or actual or perceived noncompliance with laws relating to privacy data protection or data security could result in damage to our brand and reputation including decreased customer demand for our products or services significant financial penalties and liability governmental investigations and proceedings ongoing audit requirements private or class actions and unanticipated changes to our data handling or processing practices we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage is adequate for datahandling or datasecurity liabilities incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim the successful assertion of one or more claims against us that exceed our insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies could have a material adverse effect on our business including our financial condition operating results and reputation for example the european general data protection regulation “gdpr” took effect in may 2018 and applies to our operations and our products and services used by individuals in europe t he uk has implemented legislation that substantially implements the gdpr with penalties for noncompliance various states such as california colorado utah and connecticut have implemented similar privacy laws and regulations that impose restrictive requirements regulating the use and disclosure of personal information the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” which took effect in january 2020 imposed compliance requirements and new rights for california consumers the us federal government also is contemplating privacy legislation 

further the sale and manufacturing of products in certain states and countries has and may continue to subject us and our suppliers to state federal and international laws and regulations governing protection of the environment including those governing climate change discharges of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites restrictions on the presence of certain substances in electronic products and the responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling we endeavor to ensure that we and our suppliers comply with all applicable environmental laws and regulations however compliance has increased and may continue to increase our operating costs and may otherwise impact future financial results if additional or more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future we could incur additional operating costs and capital expenditures if we fail to comply with applicable environmental laws regulations initiatives or standards of conduct our customers may refuse to purchase our products and we could be subject to fines penalties and possible prohibition of sales of our products into one or more states or countries liability to our customers and damage to our reputation which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

sec rules require certain disclosures regarding the use of specified minerals often referred to as conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured these rules could affect our ability to source directly or indirectly certain materials used in our products at competitive prices and could impact the availability of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products including gold tantalum tin and tungsten as there may be only a limited number of suppliers of “conflict free” minerals we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary conflict free minerals in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices our customers including our oem customers may require that our products be free of conflict minerals and our revenues and margins may be harmed if we are unable to procure conflict free minerals at a reasonable price or at all or are unable to pass through any increased costs associated with meeting these demands we may also face challenges with government regulators and our customers and suppliers if we are unable to sufficiently verify that the metals used in our products are conflict free furthermore our customers and manufacturing stakeholders may place increased demands on our compliance framework which may in turn negatively impact our relationships with our suppliers if we are unable to comply with requirements regarding the use of conflict and other minerals our business financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

from time to time we have been and may continue to be involved in various legal regulatory or administrative investigations inquiries negotiations or proceedings arising in the normal course of business  in the event of litigation government investigations or governmental proceedings we are subject to the inherent risks and uncertainties that may result if outcomes differ from our expectations in the event of adverse outcomes in any litigation investigation or government proceeding we could be required to pay substantial damages fines or penalties and cease certain practices or activities which could materially harm our business the costs associated with litigation and government investigations can also be unpredictable depending on the complexity and length of time devoted to such litigation or investigation litigation investigations or government proceedings may also divert the efforts and attention of our key personnel which could also harm our business  

in addition regulation or government scrutiny may impact the requirements for marketing our products and slow our ability to introduce new products resulting in an adverse impact on our business although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate these or other applicable laws rules and regulations to which we are and may be subject violations of these laws and regulations could lead to significant penalties restraints on our export or import privileges monetary fines government investigations disruption of our operating activities damage to our reputation and corporate brand criminal proceedings and regulatory or other actions that could materially adversely affect our results of operations the political and media scrutiny surrounding a governmental investigation for the violation of such laws even if an investigation does not result in a finding of violation could cause us significant expense and collateral consequences including reputational harm that could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

some of our products and services are subject to export control laws and other laws affecting the countries in which our products and services may be sold distributed or delivered and any changes to or violation of these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

due to the global nature of our business we are subject to import and export restrictions and regulations including the export administration regulations administered by the us commerce department’s bureau of industry and security “bis” and the trade and economic sanctions regulations administered by the us treasury department’s office of foreign assets control “ofac” we incorporate encryption technology into certain of our products and solutions these encryption products and the underlying technology may be exported outside of the united states only with export authorizations including by license a license exception or other appropriate government authorizations including the filing of an encryption registration the us through the bis and ofac places restrictions on the sale or export of certain products and services to certain countries persons and entities as well as for certain enduses such as military militaryintelligence and weapons of mass destruction enduses the us government also imposes sanctions through executive orders restricting us companies from conducting business activities with specified individuals and companies although we have controls and procedures to ensure compliance with all applicable regulations and orders we cannot predict whether changes in laws or regulations by the us china or another country will affect our ability to sell our products and services to existing or new customers additionally we cannot ensure that our interpretation of relevant restrictions and regulations will be accepted in all cases by relevant regulatory and enforcement authorities 

violators of any us export control and sanctions laws may be subject to significant penalties which may include monetary fines criminal proceedings against them and their officers and employees a denial of export privileges and suspension or debarment from selling products to the us government moreover the sanctions imposed by the us government could be expanded in the future our products could be shipped to those targets or for restricted enduses by third parties including potentially our channel partners despite our precautions in addition if our partners fail to obtain appropriate import export or reexport licenses or permits we may also be adversely affected through reputational harm as well as other negative consequences including government investigations and penalties a significant portion of our sales are to customers which are located in geographies that have been the focus of recent changes in us policies any further limitation that impedes our ability to export or sell our products and services could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

other countries also regulate the import and export of certain encryption and other technology including import and export licensing requirements and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to sell or distribute our products and services or could limit our partners’ or customers’ ability to sell or use our products and services in those countries which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition violations of these regulations may result in significant penalties and fines changes in our products and services or future changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products and services in those countries prevent our customers from deploying our products and services globally or in some cases prevent the export or import or sale of our products and services to certain countries governments or persons altogether from time to time various governmental agencies have proposed additional regulation of encryption technology including the escrow and government recovery of private encryption keys any change in export or import regulations economic sanctions or related legislation increased export and import controls or change in the countries governments persons or technologies targeted by such regulations in the countries where we operate could result in decreased use of our products and services by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products and services to new or existing customers which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we were ever found to have violated applicable export control laws we may be subject to various penalties available under the laws any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition even if we were not found to have violated such laws the political and media scrutiny surrounding any governmental investigation of us could cause us significant expense and reputational harm such collateral consequences could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

changes in us trade policy including the imposition of sanctions or tariffs and the resulting consequences may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

we face uncertainty with regard to us government trade policy current us government trade policy includes tariffs on certain nonus goods including information and communication technology products these measures may materially increase costs for goods imported into the united states this in turn could require us to materially increase prices to our customers which may reduce demand or if we are unable to increase prices to adequately address any tariffs quotas or duties could lower our margin on products sold and negatively impact our financial performance changes in us trade policy have resulted in and could result in more us trading partners adopting responsive trade policies including imposition of increased tariffs quotas or duties such policies could make it more difficult or costly for us to export our products to those countries therefore negatively impacting our financial performance 

we may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations  

we rely on a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws confidentiality agreements security measures and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights in the past we have been involved in significant and expensive disputes regarding our intellectual property rights and those of others including claims that we may be infringing patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties we expect that we will be involved in similar disputes in the future  

there can be no assurance tha t 

• any of our existing patents will continue to be held valid if challenged 

• patents will be issued for any of our pending applications 

• any claims allowed from existing or pending patents will have sufficient scope or strength to protect us 

• our patents will be issued in the primary countries where our products are sold in order to protect our rights and potential commercial advantage 

• we will be able to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality agreements with our customers suppliers and employees and through other security measures and 

• others will not gain access to our trade secrets 

in addition our competitors may be able to design their products around our patents and other proprietary rights enforcement of our rights often requires litigation if we bring a patent infringement action and are not successful our competitors would be able to use similar technology to compete with us moreover the defendant in such an action may successfully countersue us for infringement of their patents or assert a counterclaim that our patents are invalid or unenforceable  

furthermore we have significant operations and sales in countries where intellectual property laws and enforcement policies are often less developed less stringent or more difficult to enforce than in the united states therefore we cannot be certain that we will be able to protect our intellectual property rights in jurisdictions outside the united states

we must successfully maintain and upgrade our it systems and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations  

from time to time we expand and improve our it systems to support our business going forward consequently we are in the process of implementing and will continue to invest in and implement modifications and upgrades to our it systems and procedures including making changes to legacy systems or acquiring new systems with new functionality and building new policies procedures training programs and monitoring tools 

we are engaged in a multiyear implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning system “erp” which requires significant investment of human and financial resources the erp is designed to efficiently maintain our financial records and provide information important to the operation of our business to our management team in implementing the erp we may experience significant increases to inherent costs and risks associated with changing and acquiring these systems policies procedures and monitoring tools including capital expenditures additional operating expenses demands on management time and other risks and costs of delays or difficulties in transitioning to or integrating new systems policies procedures or monitoring tools into our current systems any significant disruption or deficiency in the design and implementation of the erp may adversely affect our ability to process orders ship product send invoices and track payments fulfill contractual obligations maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting or otherwise operate our business these implementations modifications and upgrades may not result in productivity improvements at a level that outweighs the costs of implementation or at all in addition difficulties with implementing new technology systems such as erp delays in our timeline for planned improvements significant system failures or our inability to successfully modify our it systems policies procedures or monitoring tools to respond to changes in our business needs in the past have caused and in the future may cause disruptions in our business operations increase data security risks and may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to owning our ordinary shares 

the price of our ordinary shares may be volatile and could decline significantly  

the market price of our ordinary shares has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate or decline significantly in response to various factors some of which are beyond our control including  

• general stock market conditions or general uncertainty in stock market conditions due to global economic conditions and negative financial news unrelated to our business or industry including the impact of the covid19 pandemic 

• the timing and amount of or the discontinuance of our share repurchases 

• actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations 

• announcements of innovations new products significant contracts acquisitions or significant price reductions by us or our competitors including those competitors who offer alternative storage technology solutions 

• our failure to meet our guidance or the performance estimates of investment research analysts or changes in financial estimates by investment research analysts

• actual or anticipated changes in the credit ratings of our indebtedness by rating agencies and 

• the sale of our ordinary shares held by certain equity investors or members of management 

in addition in the past following periods of decline in the market price of a company’s securities class action lawsuits have often been pursued against that company if similar litigation were pursued against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

any decision to reduce or discontinue the payment of cash dividends to our shareholders or the repurchase of our ordinary shares pursuant to our previously announced share repurchase program could cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline significantly  

although historically we have announced regular cash dividend payments and a share repurchase program we are under no obligation to pay cash dividends to our shareholders in the future at historical levels or at all or to repurchase our ordinary shares at any particular price or at all the declaration and payment of any future dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors our previously announced share repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time our payment of quarterly cash dividends and the repurchase of our ordinary shares pursuant to our share repurchase program are subject to among other things our financial position and results of operations distributable reserves available cash and cash flow capital and regulatory requirements market and economic conditions our ordinary share price and other factors any reduction or discontinuance by us of the payment of quarterly cash dividends or the repurchase of our ordinary shares pursuant to our share repurchase program could cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline significantly moreover in the event our payment of quarterly cash dividends or repurchases of our ordinary shares are reduced or discontinued our failure to resume such activities at historical levels could result in a persistent lower market valuation of our ordinary shares

impact of covid19 pandemic 

the pandemic continues to impact our business and results of operations during fiscal year 2022 we experienced the ongoing impacts of supply chain disruptions higher logistics materials and operational costs globally as well as other inflationary and macroeconomic pressures additionally constraints from certain component shortages impacted our ability to fulfill demand primarily for our nonhdd business our customers also continued to experience certain supply chain and demand disruptions resulting in demand variations across certain of our end markets including impacts from periodic governmental lockdown measures we expect these factors will continue to impact our business and results of operations over the near term 

we continue to actively monitor the effects and potential impacts of the pandemic inflation and other macroeconomic factors on all aspects of our business supply chain liquidity and capital resources including governmental policies that could periodically shut down an entire city where we our suppliers or our customers operate we are also actively working on opportunities to lower our cost structure drive further operational efficiencies and maintain supply chain discipline including adjusting our manufacturing production plans in response to these business conditions we are complying with governmental rules and guidelines across all of our sites although we are unable to predict the future impact of the pandemic on our business results of operations liquidity or capital resources at this time we expect we will continue to be negatively affected if the pandemic and related public and private health measures result in substantial manufacturing or supply chain challenges substantial reductions or delays in demand due to disruptions in the operations of our customers or partners disruptions in local and global economies volatility in the global financial markets sustained reductions or volatility in overall demand trends restrictions on the export or shipment of our products or our customer’s products or other unexpected ramifications from the pandemic for a further discussion of the uncertainties and business risks associated with the covid19 pandemic see the section entitled “risk factors” in part i item 1a of our annual report 

results of operations 

we list in the tables below summarized information from our consolidated statements of operations by dollar amounts and as a percentage of revenue 





the following table summarizes information regarding consolidated revenues by channel geography and market and hdd exabytes shipped by market and price per terabyte 



 

1 revenue is attributed to geography based on the bill from location 

revenue 



revenue in fiscal year 2022 increased approximately 9 or 980 million from fiscal year 2021 primarily due to an increase in mass capacity exabytes shipped partially offset by a decrease in legacy exabytes shipped the mass capacity storage markets continued to increase as a percentage of our total revenue and exabytes shipped in fiscal year 2022 we expect this transition from legacy to mass capacity storage markets will continue resulting in mass capacity continuing to increase as a percentage of our total revenue and total exabytes shipped in fiscal year 2023 and beyond the longterm outlook for legacy markets is for a decrease in exabyte demand 

cost of revenue and gross margin 



for fiscal year 2022 gross margin increased compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to an increase in mass capacity exabytes shipped and improved product mix shift towards higher capacity hdds partially offset by higher component and logistics costs resulting from the pandemic and global inflationary pressures 

operating expenses 



product development expense product development expenses for fiscal year 2022 increased by 38 million from fiscal year 2021 primarily due to a 25 million increase in materials expense a 17 million increase in depreciation expenses an 8 million increase in compensation and other employee benefits as a result of increase in sharebased compensation and a 3 million increase in equipment expense partially offset by a 12 million decrease in outside services expense and a 9 million decrease in variable compensation expense 

marketing and administrative expense marketing and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2022 increased by 57 million from fiscal year 2021 primarily due to a 17 million increase in compensation and other employee benefits as a result of an increase in sharebased compensation a 16 million increase in outside services expense  a 6 million increase in travel expenses as a result of the easing of pandemicrelated travel restrictions a 5 million increase in advertising costs and a 3 million increase in information technology costs 

amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles for fiscal year 2022 decreased by 1 million as compared to fiscal year 2021 due to certain intangible assets that reached the end of their useful lives 

restructuring and other net restructuring and other net for fiscal year 2022 was not material 

restructuring and other net for fiscal year 2021 was 8 million primarily comprised of workforce reduction costs and supplier transition costs partially offset by a gain from the sale of a certain property and a gain upon termination of an operating lease 

other expense net 



other expense net for fiscal year 2022 increased by 132 million compared to fiscal year 2021 primarily due to a net 97 million higher nonrecurring gain from our strategic investments in the prioryear period a 29 million increase in interest expense from the issuance of longterm debt and a 21 million increase in losses on dedesignated cash flow hedges these changes were partially offset by a 16 million decrease in foreign exchange remeasurement expense 

income taxes 



we recorded an income tax provision of 30 million for fiscal year 2022 compared to an income tax provision of 34 million for fiscal year 2021 our fiscal year 2022 income tax provision included net tax benefits of approximately 15 million related to sharebased compensation 6 million resulting from recognition of deferred tax assets and 5 million associated with change in the applicable tax rate within our nonus operations our fiscal year 2021 income tax provision included net tax benefits of approximately 8 million primarily associated with sharebased compensation and 13 million related to the united kingdom tax rate changes enacted in june 2021 

our irish tax resident parent holding company owns various us and nonirish subsidiaries that operate in multiple nonirish income tax jurisdictions our worldwide operating income is either subject to varying rates of income tax or is exempt from income tax due to tax incentive programs we operate under in singapore and thailand these tax incentives are scheduled to expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2033  certain tax incentives may be extended if specific conditions are met 

our income tax provision recorded for fiscal years 2022 and 2021 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying the irish statutory rate of 25 to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i nonirish earnings generated in jurisdictions that are subject to tax incentive programs and are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of ireland and ii current year generation of research credits 

we anticipate that our effective tax rate in future periods will generally be less than the irish statutory rate based on our ownership structure our intention to indefinitely reinvest earnings from our subsidiaries outside of ireland and the potential future increases in our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following sections discuss our principal liquidity requirements as well as our sources and uses of cash and our liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase the principal objectives of our investment policy are the preservation of principal and maintenance of liquidity we believe our cash equivalents are liquid and accessible we operate in some countries that have restrictive regulations over the movement of cash andor foreign exchange across their borders however we believe our sources of cash will continue to be sufficient to fund our operations and meet our cash requirements for the next 12 months although there can be no assurance we believe that our financial resources along with controlling our costs will allow us to manage the ongoing impacts of the pandemic on our business operations for the foreseeable future however some challenges posed by the pandemic to our industry and to our business continue to remain uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time consequently we will continue to evaluate our financial position in light of future developments particularly those relating to the pandemic 

we are not aware of any downgrades losses or other significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents from the values reported as of july 1 2022 

cash and cash equivalents 



our cash and cash equivalents decreased by 594 million from july 2 2021 primarily as a result of repurchases of our ordinary shares of 18 billion repayment of longterm debt of 701 million payment of dividends to our shareholders of 610 million and payments for capital expenditures of 381 million partially offset by net cash of 17 billion provided by operating activities and net proceeds of 12 billion from issuance of longterm debt the following table summarizes results from the consolidated statement of cash flows for the periods indicated

in fiscal year 2021 we used 466 million for net cash investing activities which was primarily due to payments for the purchase of property equipment and leasehold improvements of approximately 498 million partially offset by proceeds from the sale of investments of 29 million

liquidity sources 

our primary sources of liquidity as of july 1 2022 consist of 1 approximately 615 million in cash and cash equivalents 2 cash we expect to generate from operations and 3 175 billion available for borrowing under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility “revolving credit facility” which is part of our credit agreement the “credit agreement” 

as of july 1 2022 no borrowings including swing line loans were outstanding and no commitments were utilized for letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility is available for borrowings subject to compliance with financial covenants and other customary conditions to borrowing 

the credit agreement includes three financial covenants 1 interest coverage ratio 2 total leverage ratio and 3 a minimum liquidity amount the term of the revolving credit facility is through october 14 2026 as of july 1 2022 we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our debt agreements based on our current outlook and the information we currently have available to us we expect to be in compliance with the covenants in our debt agreements over the next 12 months 

as of july 1 2022 cash and cash equivalents held by nonirish subsidiaries was 614 million this amount is potentially subject to taxation in ireland upon repatriation by means of a dividend into our irish parent however it is our intent to indefinitely reinvest earnings of nonirish subsidiaries outside of ireland and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate such earnings by means of a taxable irish dividend should funds be needed in the irish parent company and should we be unable to fund parent company activities through means other than a taxable irish dividend we would be required to accrue and pay irish taxes on such dividend 

we believe that our sources of cash will be sufficient to fund our operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months our ability to fund liquidity requirements beyond 12 months will depend on our future cash flows which are determined by future operating performance and therefore subject to prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and financial business and other factors some of which are beyond our control for additional information on factors that could impact our ability to fund our operations and meet our cash requirements including the covid19 pandemic see the section entitled “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this annual report

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the company’s accounting policies are more fully described in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data—note 1 basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies ” the methods estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations based on this definition our most critical accounting policies include revenue  sales program accruals warranty and income taxes below we discuss these policies further as well as the estimates and judgments involved we also have other accounting policies and accounting estimates relating to uncollectible customer accounts valuation of inventories assessing goodwill and other longlived assets for impairment valuation of sharebased payments and restructuring we believe that these other accounting policies and accounting estimates either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective or it is less likely that they would have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period 

revenue  sales program accruals we record estimated variable consideration at the time of revenue recognition as a reduction to revenue variable consideration generally consists of sales incentive programs such as price protection and volume incentives aimed at increasing customer demand for oem sales rebates are typically established by estimating the most likely amount of consideration expected to be received based on an oem customers volume of purchases from us or other agreed upon rebate programs for the distribution and retail channel these sales incentive programs typically involve estimating the most likely amount of rebates related to a customers level of sales order size advertising or point of sale activity as well as the expected value of price protection adjustments based on historical analysis and forecasted pricing environment total sales programs were 14 and 14 of gross revenue in fiscal years 2022 and 2021 respectively adjustments to revenues due to under or over accruals for sales programs related to revenues reported in prior quarterly periods were less than 1 of gross revenue in fiscal years 2022 and 2021 

warranty we estimate probable product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized our warranty provision considers estimated product failure rates trends including the timing of product returns during the warranty periods and estimated repair or replacement costs related to product quality issues if any unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can result in changes to warranty costs we also exercise judgment in estimating our ability to sell refurbished products based on historical experience our judgment is subject to a greater degree of subjectivity with respect to newly introduced products because of limited experience with those products upon which to base our warranty estimates if actual warranty costs differ substantially from our estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits recognition of income and deductions and calculation of specific tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for income tax and financial statement purposes as well as tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions 

the deferred tax assets we record each period depend primarily on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states and certain nonus jurisdictions each period we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and if necessary adjust the valuation allowance so that net deferred tax assets are recorded only to the extent we conclude it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized 

in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets in full or in part we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results and our forecast of future earnings future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies the assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses actual operating results in future years could differ from our current assumptions judgments and estimates if our outlook for future taxable income changes significantly our assessment of the need for and the amount of a valuation allowance may also change resulting in an additional tax provision or benefit

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we have exposure to market risks due to the volatility of interest rates foreign currency exchange rates credit rating changes and equity and bond markets a portion of these risks may be hedged but fluctuations could impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash investment portfolio as of july 1 2022 we had no availableforsale debt securities that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for a period greater than 12 months during fiscal year 2022 we recorded a 13 million impairment loss relating to availableforsale debt securities 

we have fixed rate and variable rate debt obligations we enter into debt obligations for general corporate purposes including capital expenditures and working capital needs our term loans bear interest at a variable rate equal to libor plus a variable margin at this time we have not identified any material exposure associated with the phase out of libor by the end of 2022 

we have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements to convert the variable interest rate on the term loans to fixed interest rates the objective of the interest rate swap agreements is to eliminate the variability of interest payment cash flows associated with the variable interest rate under the term loans we designated the interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges as of july 1 2022 the aggregate notional amount of the company’s interestrate swap contracts was 12 billion of which 600 million will mature in september 2025 and 600 million will mature in july 2027 

the table below presents principal amounts and related fixed or weightedaverage interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio and debt obligations as of july 1 2022 



foreign currency exchange risk from time to time we may enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposure related to certain foreign currency commitments and anticipated foreign currency denominated expenditures our policy prohibits us from entering into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 

we hedge portions of our foreign currency denominated balance sheet positions with foreign currency forward exchange contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings will be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates the change in fair value of these contracts is recognized in earnings in the same period as the gains and losses from the remeasurement of the assets and liabilities all foreign currency forward exchange contracts mature within 12 months 

we recognized a net loss of 11 million and 10 million in cost of revenue and interest expense related to the loss of hedge designations on discontinued cash flow hedges during fiscal year 2022 respectively we recognized a net gain of 14 million and a net loss of 7 million in cost of revenue and interest expense related to the loss of hedge designations on discontinued cash flow hedges during the fiscal year 2021 

the table below provides information as of july 1 2022 about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts the table is provided in dollar equivalent amounts and presents the notional amounts at the contract exchange rates and the weightedaverage contractual foreign currency exchange rates 



 

1 equivalent to the unrealized net gain loss on existing contracts 

other market risks we have exposure to counterparty credit downgrades in the form of credit risk related to our foreign currency forward exchange contracts and our fixed income portfolio we monitor and limit our credit exposure for our foreign currency forward exchange contracts by performing ongoing credit evaluations we also manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with any one counterparty and we maintain limits on maximum tenor of contracts based on the credit rating of the financial institution additionally the investment portfolio is diversified and structured to minimize credit risk 

changes in our corporate issuer credit ratings have minimal impact on our nearterm financial results but downgrades may negatively impact our future ability to raise capital our ability to execute transactions with various counterparties and may increase the cost of such capital 

we are subject to equity market risks due to changes in the fair value of the notional investments selected by our employees as part of our nonqualified deferred compensation plan—the seagate deferred compensation plan the “sdcp” in fiscal year 2014 we entered into a total return swap “trs” in order to manage the equity market risks associated with the sdcp liabilities we pay a floating rate based on the libor plus an interest rate spread on the notional amount of the trs the trs is designed to substantially offset changes in the sdcp liabilities due to changes in the value of the investment options made by employees see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data— note 8 derivative financial instruments” of this report on form 10k

industry overview 

data storage industry 

the data storage industry includes companies that manufacture components or subcomponents designed for data storage devices as well as providers of storage solutions software and services for enterprise cloud big data computing platforms and consumer markets the rapid growth of data generation and the intelligent application of data are driving demand for data storage as more data is created at endpoints outside traditional data centers which requires processing at the edge and in the core or cloud the need for data storage and management between the edge and cloud has also increased use cases include connected and autonomous vehicles smart manufacturing and smart cities we believe the proliferation and personal creation of mediarich digital content further enabled by fifthgeneration wireless “5g” the edge the internet of things “iot” machine learning “ml” and artificial intelligence “ai” will continue to create demand for higher capacity storage solutions the resulting mass data ecosystem is expected to require increasing amounts of data storage at the edge in the core and in between 

markets 

the principal data storage markets include 

mass capacity storage markets 

mass capacity storage supports high capacity lowcost per terabyte “tb” storage applications including nearline video and image applications and networkattached storage “ nas” and edgetocloud data storage infrastructures mass capacity storage markets represent sectors that have been increasing as a percentage of our total revenue and in total exabytes shipped in fiscal years 2021 2020 and 2019 with this trend expected to continue in fiscal year 2022 

nearline nearline applications require mass capacity devices hdds and mass capacity subsystems that provide endtoend solutions to businesses for the purpose of modular and scalable storage enterprise storage applications require both highcapacity and energy efficient storage devices to support low total cost of ownership the seagate systems offer mass capacity storage solutions that provide foundational infrastructure for public and private clouds we expect the nearline market which includes storage for cloud computing content delivery archival backup services and newer use cases to continue to grow and drive increasing exabyte demand 

video imaging and analytics as well as nas video and image applications and nas drives are specifically designed to ensure the appropriate performance and reliability of the system for video analytics and camera enabled environments video and image and network storage environments nas we expect these markets which includes storage for security and smart video installations to show long term secular growth in exabyte demand 

edgetocloud data storage infrastructures transport and activation of mass data the seagate lyve portfolio grew out of our mass capacity storage portfolio it provides a simple costefficient and secure way to manage transport and activate massive volumes of data across the distributed enterprise among other elements the lyve portfolio includes a shuttle solution that enables enterprises to transfer vast amounts of data from endpoints to the core cloud and a storageasaservice cloud that provides frictionless mass capacity storage at the metro edge 

legacy markets 

legacy markets include mission critical desktop notebook consumer dvr and gaming applications we continue to service these markets but do not plan significant additional investment these markets have been decreasing as a percentage of our total revenue in fiscal years 2021 2020 and 2019 and this trend is expected to continue in fiscal year 2022 and the long term outlook is for a decrease in demand for exabytes in these markets 

mission critical storage mission critical applications are defined as those that use very highperformance enterprise class hdds and ssds with sophisticated firmware to reliably support very high workloads we expect that enterprises utilizing dedicated storage area networks will continue to drive market demand for mission critical enterprise storage solutions 

consumer storage consumer applications are externally connected storage both hdd and ssdbased used to provide backup capabilities augmented storage capacity or portable storage for pcs and mobile devices 

desktop and notebook storage these applications rely on low costperhdd and ssd devices to provide builtin storage for a wide variety of consumer and business applications 

gaming storage this market includes storage for pcbased gaming rigs as well as console gaming applications the products are optimized for the speed and responsiveness gamers require and include both internal and external storage options based on hdds and ssds 

dvr dvr applications are hdd storage for video streaming in alwayson consumer premise equipment like dvrs and media centers 

participants in the data storage industry include 

major subcomponent manufacturers companies that manufacture components or subcomponents used in data storage devices or solutions include companies that supply spindle motors heads and media and application specific integrated circuits “asics” 

storage device manufacturers companies that transform components into storage products include disk drive manufacturers and semiconductor storage manufacturers that integrate flash memory into storage products such as ssds 

storage solutions manufacturers and system integrators companies such as oems that bundle and package storage solutions distributors that integrate storage hardware and software into enduser applications cloud service providers “csps” that provide cloud based solutions to businesses for the purpose of scaleout storage solutions and modular systems and producers of solutions such as storage racks 

hyperscale data centers large hyperscale data center companies many of which are csps are increasingly designing their own storage subsystems and having them built by contract manufacturers for use inside their own data centers this trend is reshaping the storage system and subsystem market driving both innovation in system design and changes in the competitive landscape of large storage system vendors 

storage services companies that provide and host services and solutions which include storage backup archiving recovery and discovery of data 

  

demand for data storage 

the international data corporation “idc” forecasts in the seagatesponsored 2021 update of their “worldwide global datasphere forecast 20212025” show that the global datasphere should grow from 64 zettabytes in 2020 to 180 zettabytes by 2025 according to idc we are fast approaching a new era of the data age which we expect will have a positive impact on storage demand the digital transformation has given rise to many new applications all of which rely on faster access to and secure storage of data proliferating from endpoints through edge to cloud 

the datasphere forecast study found that data is shifting to both the core and the edge and by 2025 nearly 60 of the world’s data will be stored in the core and edge up from 39 in 2015 

as more applications require realtime decision making some data processing and storage is moving closer to the network edge we believe this will result in a buildup of private and edge cloud environments that will enable fast and secure access to data throughout the iot ecosystem 

factors contributing to the growth of digital content include 

• creation sharing and consumption of mediarich content such as highresolution photos high definition videos and digital music through smart phones tablets digital cameras personal video cameras dvrs gaming consoles or other digital devices 

• increasing use of video and imaging sensors to collect and analyze data used to improve traffic flow emergency response times and manufacturing production costs as well as for new surveillance systems that feature higher resolution digital cameras and thus require larger data storage capacities 

• creation and collection of data through the development and evolution of the iot ecosystem big data analytics ai and new technology trends such as autonomous vehicles and drones smart manufacturing and smart cities 

• the growing use of analytics especially for action on data created at the edge instead of processing and analyzing at the data center which is particularly important for verticals such as autonomous vehicles property monitoring systems smart manufacturing and others 

• cloud migration initiatives and the ongoing advancement of the cloud including the build out of large numbers of cloud data centers by csps and private companies transitioning onsite data centers into the cloud and 

• need for protection of increased digital content through redundant storage on backup devices and externally provided storage services 

as a result of these factors we anticipate that the nature and volume of data being created will require greater storage capability which is more efficiently and economically facilitated by higher capacity mass storage devices 

in addition the economics of storage infrastructure are also evolving the utilization of public and private hyperscale storage and opensource solutions is reducing the total cost of ownership of storage while increasing the speed and efficiency with which customers can leverage massive computing and storage devices accordingly we expect these trends will continue to create significant demand for data storage products and solutions going forward 

demand trends 

we believe that continued growth in digital content creation will require increasingly higher storage capacity in order to store aggregate host distribute analyze manage protect back up and use such content we also believe that as architectures evolve to serve a growing commercial and consumer user base throughout the world storage solutions will evolve as well 

mass capacity is and will continue to be the enabler of scale we expect increased data creation will lead to the expansion of the need for storage in the form of hdds ssds and systems while the advance of solid state technology in many end markets is expected to increase we believe that in the foreseeable future cloud edge and traditional enterprise which require highcapacity storage solutions will be best served by hdds due to their ability to deliver reliable energyefficient and the most cost effective mass storage devices we also believe that as hdd capacities continue to increase a focus exclusively on unit demand does not reflect the increase in demand for exabytes as demand for higher capacity drives increases the demand profile has shifted to reflect fewer total hdd units but with higher average capacity per drive and higher overall exabyte demand 

industry supply balance 

from time to time the storage industry has experienced periods of imbalance between supply and demand to the extent that the storage industry builds or maintains capacity based on expectations of demand that do not materialize price erosion may become more pronounced conversely during periods where demand exceeds supply price erosion is generally muted 

our business 

data storage technologies 

the design and manufacturing of hdds depends on highly advanced technology and manufacturing techniques therefore it requires high levels of research and development spending and capital equipment investments we design fabricate and assemble a number of the most important components in our disk drives including readwrite heads and recording media our design and manufacturing operations are based on technology platforms that are used to produce various disk drive products that serve multiple data storage applications and markets our core technology platforms including innovations like the throughputoptimizing multi actuator mach2 technology and the highcapacity enabling heatassisted magnetic recording “hamr” technology focus on the areal density of media and readwrite head technologies this design and manufacturing approach allows us to deliver a portfolio of storage products to service a wide range of data storage applications and industries 

disk drives that we manufacture are commonly differentiated by the following key characteristics 

• inputoutput operations per second “iops” commonly expressed in megabytes per second which is the maximum number of reads and writes to a storage location 

• storage capacity commonly expressed in tb which is the amount of data that can be stored on the disk drive 

• spindle rotation speed commonly expressed in revolutions per minute “rpm” which has an effect on speed of access to data 

• interface transfer rate commonly expressed in megabytes per second which is the rate at which data moves between the disk drive and the computer controller 

• average seek time commonly expressed in milliseconds which is the time needed to position the heads over a selected track on the disk surface 

• data transfer rate commonly expressed in megabytes per second which is the rate at which data is transferred to and from the disk drive 

• product quality and reliability commonly expressed in annualized return rates and 

• energy efficiency commonly measured by the power output necessary to operate the disk drive 

areal density is measured by storage capacity per square inch on the recording surface of a disk the storage capacity of a disk drive is determined by the size and number of disks it contains as well as the areal density capability of these disks 

we also offer ssds as part of our storage solutions portfolio our portfolio includes devices with sata sas and nvme interfaces the ssds differ from hdds in that they are without mechanical parts 

ssds store data on nand flash memory cells or metaloxide semiconductor transistors using a charge on a capacitor to represent a binary digit ssd technology offers fast access to data and robust performance ssds complement hyperscale applications highdensity data centers cloud environments and web servers they are also used in missioncritical enterprise applications consumer gaming and nas applications 

the sshds that we manufacture contain technology that fuses some features of ssds and hdds they include high capacity hdds with flash memory that acts as a cache to improve performance of frequently accessed data and are primarily targeted at pc gaming applications 

manufacturing 

we primarily design and manufacture our own readwrite heads and recording media which are critical technologies for disk drives this integrated approach enables us to lower costs and to improve the functionality of components so that they work together efficiently 

we believe that because of our vertical design and manufacturing strategy we are well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities to leverage the close interdependence of components for disk drives our manufacturing efficiency and flexibility are critical elements of our integrated business strategy we continuously seek to improve our manufacturing efficiency and reduce manufacturing costs by 

• employing manufacturing automation 

• employing machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence 

• improving product quality and reliability 

• integrating our supply chain with suppliers and customers to enhance our demand visibility and reduce our working capital requirements 

• coordinating between our manufacturing group and our research and development organization to rapidly achieve volume manufacturing and 

• operating our facilities at optimal capacities 

a vertically integrated model however tends to have less flexibility when demand declines as it exposes us to higher unit costs when capacity utilization is not optimized 

components and raw materials 

disk drives incorporate certain components including a head disk assembly and a printed circuit board mounted to the head disk assembly which are sealed inside a rigid base and top cover containing the recording components in a contaminationcontrolled environment we maintain a highly integrated approach to our business by designing and manufacturing a significant portion of the components we view as critical to our products such as readwrite heads and recording media 

readwrite heads the function of the readwrite head is to scan across the disk as it spins magnetically recording or reading information the tolerances of readwrite heads are extremely demanding and require stateoftheart equipment and processes our readwrite heads are manufactured with thinfilm and photolithographic processes similar to those used to produce semiconductor integrated circuits though challenges related to magnetic film properties and topographical structures are unique to the disk drive industry we perform all primary stages of design and manufacture of readwrite heads at our facilities we use a combination of internally manufactured and externally sourced readwrite heads the mix of which varies based on product mix technology and our internal capacity levels 

media data is written to or read from the media or disk as it rotates at very high speeds past the readwrite head the media is made from nonmagnetic substrates usually an aluminum alloy or glass and is coated with thin layers of magnetic materials we use a combination of internally manufactured and externally sourced finished media and aluminum substrates the mix of which varies based on product mix technology and our internal capacity levels we purchase all of our glass substrates from third parties 

printed circuit board assemblies the printed circuit board assemblies “pcbas” are comprised of standard and custom asics and ancillary electronic control chips the asics control the movement of data to and from the readwrite heads and through the internal controller and interface which communicates with the host computer the asics and control chips form electronic circuitry that delivers instructions to a head positioning mechanism called an actuator to guide the heads to the selected track of a disk where the data is recorded or retrieved disk drive manufacturers use one or more industry standard interfaces such as sata scsi or sas to communicate to the host systems 

head disk assembly the head disk assembly consists of one or more disks attached to a spindle assembly powered by a spindle motor that rotates the disks at a high constant speed around a hub readwrite heads mounted on an arm assembly similar in concept to that of a record player fly extremely close to each disk surface and record data on and retrieve it from concentric tracks in the magnetic layers of the rotating disks the readwrite heads are mounted vertically on an eshaped assembly “eblock” that is actuated by a voicecoil motor to allow the heads to move from track to track the eblock and the recording media are mounted inside the head disk assembly we purchase spindle motors from outside vendors and from time to time participate in the design of the motors that go into our products 

disk drive assembly following the completion of the head disk assembly it is mated to the pcba and the completed unit goes through extensive defect mapping and machine learning prior to packaging and shipment disk drive assembly and machine learning operations occur primarily at our facilities located in china and thailand we perform subassembly and component manufacturing operations at our facilities in china malaysia northern ireland singapore thailand and the united states 

contract manufacturing we outsource the manufacturing and assembly of certain components and products to third parties in various countries worldwide this includes outsourcing the pcbas used in our disk drives ssds and storage subsystems we continue to participate in the design of our components and products and are directly involved in qualifying key suppliers and components used in our products 

suppliers of components and industry constraints there are a limited number of independent suppliers of components such as recording heads and media available to disk drive manufacturers vertically integrated disk drive manufacturers like us who manufacture their own components are less dependent on external component suppliers than less vertically integrated disk drive manufacturers however our business has been adversely affected by our suppliers’ capacity constraints in the past and this could occur in the future 

commodity and other manufacturing costs the production of disk drives requires rare earth elements precious metals scarce alloys and industrial commodities which are subject to fluctuations in price and the supply of which has at times been constrained in addition to increased costs of components and commodities volatility in fuel and other transportation costs may also increase our costs related to commodities manufacturing and freight as a result we may increase our use of alternative shipment methods to help offset any increase in freight costs and we will continually review various forms of shipments and routes in order to minimize the exposure to higher freight costs

customers 

we sell our products to major oems distributors and retailers 

oem customers including large hyperscale data center companies and csps typically enter into master purchase agreements with us deliveries are scheduled only after receipt of purchase orders in addition with limited leadtime customers may defer most purchase orders without significant penalty anticipated orders from many of our customers have in the past failed to materialize or oem delivery schedules have been deferred or altered as a result of changes in their business needs 

our distributors generally enter into nonexclusive agreements for the resale of our products they typically furnish us with a nonbinding indication of their nearterm requirements and product deliveries are generally scheduled accordingly the agreements and related sales programs typically provide the distributors with limited rights of return and price protection rights in addition we offer sales programs to distributors on a quarterly and periodic basis to promote the sale of selected products in the sales channel 

our retail channel consists of our branded storage products sold to retailers either by us directly or by our distributors retail sales made by us or our distributors typically require greater marketing support sales incentives and price protection periods 

see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data— note 16 business segment and geographic information ” contained in this report for a description of our major customers 

competition 

we compete primarily with manufacturers of hard drives used in the mass capacity storage and legacy markets and with other companies in the data storage industry that provide ssds and systems some of the principal factors used by customers to differentiate among data storage solutions manufacturers are storage capacity product performance product quality and reliability price per unit and price per tb storageretrieval access times data transfer rates form factor product warranty and support capabilities supply continuity and flexibility power consumption total cost of ownership and brand while different markets and customers place varying levels of emphasis on these factors we believe that our products are competitive with respect to many of these factors in the markets that we currently compete in 

principal competitors we compete with manufacturers of storage solutions and the other principal manufacturers in the data storage solution industry including 

• micron technology inc 

• samsung electronics 

• sk hynix inc 

• kioxia holdings corporation 

• toshiba corporation and 

• western digital corporation operating the western digital hitachi global storage technologies and sandisk brands 

price erosion historically our industry has been characterized by price declines for data storage products with comparable capacity performance and feature sets “likeforlike products” price declines for likeforlike products “price erosion” tend to be more pronounced during periods of 

• economic contraction in which competitors may use discounted pricing to attempt to maintain or gain market share 

• few new product introductions when competitors have comparable or alternative product offerings and 

• industry supply exceeding demand 

data storage manufacturers typically attempt to offset price erosion with an improved mix of data storage products characterized by higher capacity better performance and additional feature sets and product cost reductions 

we believe the hdd industry experienced modest price erosion in fiscal years 2021 2020 and 2019 

product life cycles and changing technology success in our industry has been dependent to a large extent on the ability to balance the introduction and transition of new products with timetovolume performance capacity and quality metrics at a competitive price level of service and support that our customers expect generally the drive manufacturer that introduces a new product first benefits from improved product mix favorable profit margins and less pricing pressure until comparable products are introduced changing technology also necessitates ongoing investments in research and development which may be difficult to recover due to rapid product life cycles and economic declines further there is a continued need to successfully execute product transitions and new product introductions as factors such as quality reliability and manufacturing yields continue to be of significant competitive importance 

cyclicality and seasonality 

variability of sales can be related to the timing of it spending or a reflection of cyclical demand from csps based on the timing of their procurement and deployment requirements and the supply and demand balance of other components such as nand and dram our legacy markets traditionally experience seasonal variability in demand with higher levels of demand in the second half of the calendar year this seasonality is driven by consumer spending in the backtoschool season from late summer to fall and the traditional holiday shopping season from fall to winter 

research and development 

we are committed to developing new component technologies products alternative storage technologies inclusive of systems software and other innovative technology solutions to support emerging applications in data use and storage our research and development focus is designed to bring new products to market in high volume with quality attributes that our customers expect before our competitors part of our product development strategy is to leverage a design platform andor subsystem within product families to serve different market needs this platform strategy allows for more efficient resource utilization leverages best design practices reduces exposure to changes in demand and allows for achievement of lower costs through purchasing economies our advanced technology integration effort focuses disk drive and component research on recording subsystems including readwrite heads and recording media marketspecific product technology and technology we believe may lead to new business opportunities the primary purpose of our advanced technology integration effort is to ensure timely availability of mature component technologies for our product development teams as well as to allow us to leverage and coordinate those technologies in the design centers across our products in order to take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace 

patents and licenses 

as of july 2 2021 we had approximately 5300 us patents and 1100 patents issued in various foreign jurisdictions as well as approximately 600 us and 200 foreign patent applications pending the number of patents and patent applications will vary at any given time as part of our ongoing patent portfolio management activity due to the rapid technological change that characterizes the data storage industry we believe that in addition to patent protection the improvement of existing products reliance upon trade secrets protection of unpatented proprietary knowhow and development of new products are also important to our business in establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage accordingly we intend to continue our efforts to broadly protect our intellectual property including obtaining patents where available in connection with our research and development program 

the data storage industry is characterized by significant litigation arising from time to time relating to patent and other intellectual property rights from time to time we receive claims that our products infringe patents of third parties although we have been able to resolve some of those claims or potential claims without a material adverse effect on us other claims have resulted in adverse decisions or settlements in addition other claims are pending which if resolved unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations for more information on these claims see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data— note 14 legal environmental and other contingencies ” the costs of engaging in intellectual property litigation in the past have been and in the future may be substantial irrespective of the merits of the claim or the outcome 

backlog 

in view of industry practice whereby customers may cancel or defer orders with little or no penalty we believe backlog for our business is of limited indicative value in estimating future performance and results 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we operate relating to the protection of the environment including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites some of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution and these permits are subject to modification renewal and revocation by issuing authorities 

we have established environmental management systems and continually update environmental policies and standard operating procedures for our operations worldwide we believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws regulations and permits we budget for operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental laws if additional or more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future we could incur additional operating costs and capital expenditures 

some environmental laws such as the us comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended the “superfund” law and its state equivalents can impose liability for the cost of cleanup of contaminated sites upon any of the current or former site owners or operators or upon parties who sent waste to these sites regardless of whether the owner or operator owned the site at the time of the release of hazardous substances or the lawfulness of the original disposal activity we have been identified as a responsible or potentially responsible party at several sites based on current estimates of cleanup costs and our expected allocation of these costs we do not expect costs in connection with these sites to be material 

we may be subject to various state federal and international laws and regulations governing environmental matters including those restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products for example the european union “eu” enacted the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment 201165eu which prohibits the use of certain substances including lead in certain products including disk drives and server storage products put on the market after july 1 2006 similar legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions including in the us canada mexico taiwan china and japan the eu reach directive registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals ec 19072006 also restricts substances of very high concern in products if we or our suppliers fail to comply with the substance restrictions recycle requirements or other environmental requirements as they are enacted worldwide it could have a materially adverse effect on our business 

social and employee matters 

as of july 2 2021 we employed approximately 40000 employees and temporary employees worldwide of which approximately 33000 were located in our asia operations we believe that our employees are crucial to our current success and that our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract retain and further motivate qualified employees at all levels we believe that our employee relations are good 

diversity equity  inclusion one of our core values is inclusion we rely on our diverse workforce to develop deliver and sustain our business strategy and achieve our goals one way we embrace our diverse employees and promote a culture of inclusion is through the support of employee resource groups “erg” these voluntary employeeled communities are built on a shared diversity of identity experience or thought and provide a number of benefits to employees including professional and leadership development seagate’s erg community encompasses a wide array of diversity such as lgbtq women people of color and interfaith and includes over 20 chapters across five countries we also support inclusion through active employee communications unconscious bias education and ongoing efforts to ensure our employees feel safe respected and welcomed during fiscal year 2021 we published our annual diversity equity and inclusion “dei” report which provides an overview of our dei efforts and outcomes including demographics on our workforce the fiscal year 2020 dei report is available on our website 

health  safety all our manufacturing sites have health and safety management systems certified to iso 45001 which was migrated from occupational health and safety assessment series 18001 in fiscal year 2021 we work hard to keep our employees safe and healthy which is why our global health and safety standards as well as our accompanying management systems frequently go beyond country or industrylevel guidelines we also hosted health and safety regulatory visits that focused on issues such as safety radiation fire codes food and transportation remaining focused on the continuous improvement of employee health and safety we continued to provide comprehensive health and safety training to our employees in fiscal year 2021 we emphasize elearning courses as our main vehicle for delivering such training because employees can learn at their own pace in response to the covid19 pandemic and to protect the health and wellbeing of our employees customers suppliers and the communities in which we operate we implemented significant safety protocols over the past 15 months including employees working from home restricting the number of employees attending events or meetings in person limiting the number of people in our buildings and factories at any one time further restricting access to our facilities suspending employee travel refraining from meeting in person with customers and suppliers health and temperature screenings contact tracing and enhanced cleaning procedures we will continue to monitor the impact of the covid19 pandemic and will adjust these measures over time as appropriate to protect the health and wellbeing of our employees customers suppliers and communities 

development retention compensation benefits  engagement our performance management system is a continuous process that helps team members focus on the right priorities meaningful conversations between managers and employees are the foundation of performance management at seagate we focus on dialogue centered around manager and employee conversations and ongoing feedback to align goals this approach focuses on achieving highquality productive dialogue between managers and employees we also encourage our employees to participate in the many learning opportunities that are available at seagate the portfolio of learning and training formats include but are not limited to mentoring and coaching elearning opportunities linkedin learning classroom training onthejob training and other strategic internal programs that cover topics ranging from leadership and technical skills to health safety and the environment in addition we are investing to reskill and redeploy employees as needed to support our future growth and respond to the changing demands of the business for example we launched a tool earlier this fiscal year that has already helped seagate employees to establish networking and mentor connections as well as redeployment opportunities for hundreds of employees 

our total rewards program is designed to attract motivate and retain talented people in order to successfully meet our business goals the program includes base pay annual bonuses commissions equity awards an employee share purchasing plan retirement savings opportunities and other employee health and wellness benefits our compensation programs and guidelines are structured to align pay with performance and aim to provide internally and externally competitive total compensation 

employee engagement is the psychological commitment and passion that drives discretionary effort it predicts individual performance and is the measure of the relationship between employees and the company this year we expanded our engagement survey to include additional facets of the employee experience throughout the employee life cycle employee experience is what employees encounter and observe over the course of their career at seagate a positive employee experience can have an impact on everything from recruiting to seagates bottom line 

in our fiscal year 2021 survey 92 of our global employees shared their feedback on their experience at seagate following the conclusion of the survey people managers were provided access to a dashboard with results that shared the key drivers of engagement specific to their own department managers were asked to follow our “understand share and take action” process to analyze their results share and discuss with their teams and create customized action plans designed to have the greatest impact to engagement for their particular department 

giving back our community engagement program is designed to provide support to our local communities with an emphasis on science technology engineering and mathematics “stem” and also addressing health and human services and environmental opportunities the program is reflective of seagate’s vertically integrated model with multiple large facilities across emea asia and the united states accordingly the program is highly localized involving a crossfunctional process to identify and execute on opportunities that are meaningful locally 

in general we maintain an emphasis on stem targeting k12 students supporting stem efforts in a way that is ageappropriate and allows for fun as well as learning in fiscal year 2021 due to covid19 seagate pivoted to virtual engagements and funding of stem partners as they worked to deliver their programs online or in a socially distanced manner seagate also increased support of health  human services partnerships due to the pandemic such as support of food banks clinics and nonprofit organizations providing covid19 health care and relief while sustaining many of our ongoing community partnerships

risks related to our business operations and industry 

our ability to increase our revenue and maintain our market share depends on our ability to successfully introduce and achieve market acceptance of new products on a timely basis if our products do not keep pace with customer requirements our results of operations will be adversely affected 

the markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product introductions and technology enhancements uncertain product life cycles and changes in customer demand the success of our products and services also often depends on whether our offerings are compatible with our customers’ or thirdparties’ products or services and their changing technologies our customers demand new generations of storage products as advances in computer hardware and software have created the need for improved storage with features such as increased storage capacity enhanced security energy efficiency improved performance and reliability and lower cost we and our competitors have developed improved products and we will need to continue to do so in the future 

historically our results of operations have substantially depended upon our ability to be among the firsttomarket with new data storage product offerings we may face technological operational and financial challenges in developing new products in addition our investments in new product development may not yield the anticipated benefits our market share revenue and results of operations in the future may be adversely affected if we fail to 

• develop new products identify business strategies and timely introduce competitive product offerings to meet technological shifts or we are unable to execute successfully 

• consistently maintain our timetomarket performance with our new products 

• produce these products in adequate volume 

• meet specifications or satisfy compatibility requirements 

• qualify these products with key customers on a timely basis by meeting our customers’ performance and quality specifications or 

• achieve acceptable manufacturing yields quality and costs with these products 

accordingly we cannot accurately determine the ultimate effect that our new products will have on our results of operations our failure to accurately anticipate customers’ needs and accurately identify the shift in technological changes could materially adversely affect our longterm financial results 

in addition the concentration of customers in our largest end markets magnifies the potential effect of missing a product qualification opportunity if the delivery of our products is delayed our customers may use our competitors’ products to meet their requirements 

when we develop new products with higher capacity and more advanced technology our results of operations may decline because the increased difficulty and complexity associated with producing these products increases the likelihood of reliability quality or operability problems if our products experience increases in failure rates are of low quality or are not reliable customers may reduce their purchases of our products our factory utilization may decrease and our manufacturing rework and scrap costs and our service and warranty costs may increase in addition a decline in the reliability of our products may make it more difficult for us to effectively compete with our competitors 

additionally we may be unable to produce new products that have higher capacities and more advanced technologies in the volumes and timeframes that are required to meet customer demand we are transitioning to key areal density recording technologies that use hamr technology to increase hdd capacities if our transitions to more advanced technologies including the transition to hdds utilizing hamr technology require development and production cycles that are longer than anticipated or if we otherwise fail to implement new hdd technologies successfully we may lose sales and market share which could significantly harm our financial results 

we cannot assure you that we will be among the leaders in timetomarket with new products or that we will be able to successfully qualify new products with our customers in the future if our new products are not successful our future results of operations may be adversely affected 

we operate in highly competitive markets and our failure to anticipate and respond to technological changes and other market developments including price could harm our ability to compete 

we face intense competition in the data storage industry our principal sources of competition include hdd and ssd manufacturers and companies that provide storage subsystems including electronic manufacturing services and contract electronic manufacturing 

the markets for our data storage products are characterized by technological change which is driven in part by the adoption of new industry standards these standards provide mechanisms to ensure technology component interoperability but they also hinder our ability to innovate or differentiate our products when this occurs our products may be deemed commodities which could result in downward pressure on prices 

we also experience competition from other companies that produce alternative storage technologies such as flash memory where increasing capacity decreasing cost energy efficiency and improvements in performance have resulted in increased competition with our lower capacity smaller form factor disk drives some customers for both mass capacity storage and legacy markets have adopted ssds as an alternative to hard drives in certain applications further adoption of ssds or other alternative storage technologies may limit our total addressable hdd market impact the competitiveness of our product portfolio and reduce our market share any resulting increase in competition could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations  

we may be adversely affected by the loss of or reduced delayed or canceled purchases by one or more of our key customers  

some of our key customers account for a large portion of our revenue while we have longstanding relationships with many of our customers if any key customers were to significantly reduce defer or cancel their purchases from us or delay product acceptances or we were prohibited from selling to those key customers our results of operations would be adversely affected although sales to key customers may vary from period to period a key customer that permanently discontinues or significantly reduces its relationship with us or that we are prohibited from selling to could be difficult to replace in line with industry practice new key customers usually require that we pass a lengthy and rigorous qualification process accordingly it may be difficult or costly for us to attract new key customers  conversely if one of our key customers unexpectedly increases its orders we may be unable to produce the additional product volumes in a timely manner or take advantage of any overall increased market demand this could damage our customer relationships and reputation which may adversely affect our results of operations  

additionally if there is consolidation among our customer base our customers may be able to command increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale which could adversely affect our profitability furthermore if such customer pressures require us to reduce our pricing such that our gross margins are diminished it might not be feasible to sell to a particular customer which could result in a decrease in our revenue consolidation among our customer base may also lead to reduced demand for our products replacement of our products by the combined entity with those of our competitors and cancellations of orders each of which could adversely affect our results of operations if a significant transaction or regulatory impact involving any of our key customers results in the loss of or reduction in purchases by these key customers it could have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition  

we are dependent on sales to distributors and retailers which may increase price erosion and the volatility of our sales  

a substantial portion of our sales has been to distributors and retailers of disk drive products certain of our distributors and retailers may also market competing products we face significant competition in this distribution channel as a result of limited product qualification programs and a focus on price terms and product availability sales volumes through this channel are also less predictable and subject to greater volatility in addition deterioration in business and economic conditions could exacerbate price erosion and volatility as distributors or retailers lower prices to compensate for lower demand and higher inventory levels our distributors’ and retailers’ ability to access credit to fund their operations may also affect their purchases of our products if prices decline significantly in this distribution channel or our distributors or retailers reduce purchases of our products or if distributors or retailers experience financial difficulties or terminate their relationships with us our revenues and results of operations would be adversely affected 

we must plan our investments in our products and incur costs before we have customer orders or know about the market conditions at the time the products are produced if we fail to predict demand accurately for our products or if the markets for our products change we may be unable to meet demand or we may have insufficient demand which may materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our manufacturing process requires us to make significant productspecific investments in inventory for production at least three to six months in advance as a result we incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales that may never materialize or that may be substantially lower than expected if actual demand for our products is lower than the forecast we may also experience higher inventory carrying costs manufacturing rework costs and product obsolescence conversely if we underestimate demand we may have insufficient inventory to satisfy demand and may have to forego sales  

other factors that have affected and may continue to affect our ability to anticipate or meet the demand for our products and adversely affect our results of operations include 

• competitive product announcements or technological advances that result in excess supply when customers cancel purchases in anticipation of newer products 

• variable demand resulting from unanticipated upward or downward pricing pressures 

• our ability to successfully qualify manufacture and sell our data storage products 

• changes in our product mix which may adversely affect our gross margins 

• key customers deferring or canceling purchases or delaying product acceptances or unexpected increases in their orders 

• manufacturing delays or interruptions particularly at our manufacturing facilities in china malaysia northern ireland singapore thailand or the united states 

• limited access to components that we obtain from a single or a limited number of suppliers and 

• the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the cost of producing our products and the effective price of our products to nonus customers 

changes in demand for computer systems data storage subsystems and consumer electronic devices may in the future cause a decline in demand for our products or an increase in demand for our products that we are unable to meet 

our products are components in computers data storage systems and consumer electronic devices historically the demand for these products has been volatile unexpected slowdowns in demand for computers data storage subsystems or consumer electronic devices generally result in sharp declines in demand for our products declines in customer spending on the systems and devices that incorporate our products could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and on our financial condition and results of operations uncertain global economic and business conditions can exacerbate these risks 

we are dependent on our longterm investments to manufacture adequate products our investment decisions in adding new assembly and test capacity require significant planning and leadtime and a failure to accurately forecast demand for our products could cause us to overinvest or underinvest which would lead to excess capacity underutilization charges impairments or loss of sales and revenue opportunities 

sales to the legacy markets remain an important part of our business these markets however have been and we expect them to continue to be adversely affected by 

• announcements or introductions of major new operating systems or semiconductor improvements or shifts in customer preferences performance requirements and behavior such as the shift to tablet computers smart phones nand flash memory or similar devices that meet customers’ cost and capacity metrics 

• longer product life cycles and 

• changes in macroeconomic conditions that cause customers to spend less such as the imposition of new tariffs increased laws and regulations and increased unemployment levels 

we believe that the deterioration of demand for disk drives in certain of the legacy markets has accelerated and this deterioration may continue or further accelerate which could cause our operating results to suffer 

in addition we believe announcements regarding competitive product introductions from time to time have caused customers to defer or cancel their purchases making certain inventory obsolete whenever an oversupply of products in the market causes our industry to have higher than anticipated inventory levels we experience even more intense price competition from other manufacturers than usual which may materially adversely affect our financial results 

we experience seasonal declines in the sales of our consumer products during the second half of our fiscal year which may adversely affect our results of operations 

in certain end markets sales of computers storage subsystems and consumer electronic devices tend to be seasonal and therefore we expect to continue to experience seasonality in our business as we respond to variations in our customers’ demand for our products in particular we anticipate that sales of our products will continue to be lower during the second half of our fiscal year retail sales of our legacy markets solutions traditionally experience higher demand in the first half of our fiscal year driven by consumer spending in the backtoschool season from late summer to fall and the traditional holiday shopping season from fall to winter we experience seasonal reductions in the second half of our fiscal year in the business activities of our customers during international holidays like lunar new year as well as in the summer months particularly in europe which typically result in lower sales during those periods since our working capital needs peak during periods in which we are increasing production in anticipation of orders that have not yet been received our results of operations will fluctuate even if the forecasted demand for our products proves accurate failure to anticipate consumer demand for our branded solutions as well as an inability to maintain effective working relationships with retail and online distributors may also adversely impact our future results of operations  furthermore it is difficult for us to evaluate the degree to which this seasonality may affect our business in future periods because of the rate and unpredictability of product transitions and new product introductions as well as macroeconomic conditions 

we may not be successful in our efforts to grow our systems ssd and lyve revenues 

we have made and continue to make investments to grow our systems ssd and lyve platform revenues our ability to grow systems ssd and lyve revenues is subject to the following risks 

• we may be unable to accurately estimate and predict data center capacity and requirements 

• we may not be able to offer compelling solutions or services to enterprises subscribers or consumers 

• we may be unable to obtain cost effective supply of nand flash memory in order to offer competitive ssd solutions and 

• our cloud systems revenues generally have a longer sales cycle and growth is likely to depend on relatively large customer orders which may increase the variability of our results of operations and the difficulty of matching revenues with expenses 

our results of operations and share price may be adversely affected if we are not successful in our efforts to grow our revenues as anticipated in addition our growth in these markets may bring us into closer competition with some of our customers or potential customers which may decrease their willingness to do business with us 

our worldwide sales operations subject us to risks that may adversely affect our business related to disruptions in international markets currency exchange fluctuations increased costs and global health outbreaks  

we are a global company and have significant sales operations outside of the united states including sales personnel and customer support operations we also generate a significant portion of our revenue from sales outside the us disruptions in the economic environmental political legal or regulatory landscape in the countries where we operate may have a material adverse impact on our manufacturing and sales operations disruptions in financial markets and the deterioration of global economic conditions have had and may continue to have an impact on our sales to customers located in or whose enduser customers are located in such countries 

prices for our products are denominated predominantly in dollars even when sold to customers that are located outside the us an increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside of the us where we sell in dollars this could adversely impact our sales and market share in such areas or increase pressure on us to lower our price and adversely impact our profit margins in addition we have revenue and expenses denominated in currencies other than the dollar primarily the thai baht singaporean dollar chinese renminbi and british pound sterling which further exposes us to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates a weakened dollar could increase the effective cost of our expenses such as payroll utilities tax and marketing expenses as well as overseas capital expenditures any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations we have attempted to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes by among other things entering into foreign currency forward exchange contracts from time to time which could be designated as cash flow hedges or not designated as hedging instruments our hedging strategy may be ineffective and specific hedges may expire and not be renewed or may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations the hedging activities may not cover our full exposure subject us to certain counterparty credit risks and may impact our results of operations see “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk— foreign currency exchange risk ” of this report for additional information about our foreign currency exchange risk 

the shipping and transportation costs associated with our international operations are typically higher than those associated with our us operations resulting in decreased operating margins in some countries volatility in fuel costs political instability or constraints in or increases in the costs of air transportation may lead us to develop alternative shipment methods which could disrupt our ability to receive raw materials or ship finished product and as a result our business and results of operations may be harmed 

the occurrence of a pandemic disease such as the recent covid19 pandemic has impacted and may adversely impact our operations including without limitation logistical and other operational costs and the operations of some of our customers 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic has impacted our business operating results and financial condition  as well as the operations and financial performance of many of the customers and suppliers in industries that we serve we are unable to predict the extent to which the pandemic and related effects will adversely impact our business operations financial performance results of operations financial position and the achievement of our strategic objectives  

the covid19 pandemic has resulted in a widespread health crisis and numerous disease control measures being taken to limit its spread the impact of the pandemic on our business has included or could in the future include 

• disruptions to or restrictions on our ability to ensure the continuous manufacture and supply of our products and services including insufficiency of our existing inventory levels and temporary or permanent closures or reductions in operational capacity of our facilities or the facilities of our direct or indirect suppliers or customers and any supply chain disruptions 

• temporary shortages of skilled employees available to staff manufacturing facilities due to stay at home orders and travel restrictions within as well as into and out of countries 

• increases in operational expenses and other costs related to requirements implemented to mitigate the impact of the pandemic 

• delays or limitations on the ability of our customers to perform or make timely payments 

• reductions in short and longterm demand for our products or other disruptions in technology buying patterns 

• adverse effects on economies and financial markets globally or in various markets throughout the world potentially leading to a prolonged economic downturn or reductions in business and consumer spending which may result in decreased net revenue gross margins or earnings andor in increased expenses and difficulty in managing inventory levels 

• delays to andor lengthening of our sales or development cycles or qualification activity 

• challenges for us our direct and indirect suppliers and our customers in obtaining financing due to turmoil in financial markets 

• workforce disruptions due to illness quarantines governmental actions other restrictions andor the social distancing measures we have taken to mitigate the impact of covid19 in an effort to protect the health and wellbeing of our employees customers suppliers and of the communities in which we operate 

• increased vulnerability to cyberattacks due to the significant number of employees working remotely and 

• our management team continuing to commit significant time attention and resources to monitoring the covid19 pandemic and seeking to mitigate its effects on our business and workforce 

the covid19 pandemic has increased economic and demand uncertainty it continues to affect our business in both positive and negative ways and there is uncertainty around its duration and impact in some markets or industries where workfromhome or shelterinplace orders have driven an increase in sales for certain of our products the demand may not be sustainable if conditions change the ultimate extent of the impact of covid19 on our business financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments including the impact of any virus mutations or new strains of covid19 and the distribution and efficacy of the vaccine which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time these impacts individually or in the aggregate could have a material and adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition such effect may be exacerbated in the event the pandemic and the measures taken in response to it and their effects persist for an extended period of time or if there is a resurgence of the outbreak or variants thereof under any of these circumstances the resumption of normal business operations may be delayed or hampered by lingering effects of covid19 on our operations direct and indirect suppliers partners and customers the covid19 pandemic may also heighten other risks described in this risk factors section 

if we do not control our fixed costs we will not be able to compete effectively  

we continually seek to make our cost structure and business processes more efficient we are focused on increasing workforce flexibility and scalability and improving overall competitiveness by leveraging our global capabilities as well as external talent and skills worldwide our strategy involves to a substantial degree increasing revenue and exabytes volume while at the same time controlling expenses if we do not control our manufacturing and operating expenses our ability to compete in the marketplace may be impaired in the past activities to reduce costs have included closures and transfers of facilities significant personnel reductions restructuring efforts and efforts to increase automation our restructuring efforts may not yield the intended benefits and may be unsuccessful or disruptive to our business operations which may materially adversely affect our financial results  

risks associated with supply and manufacturing 

if we experience shortages or delays in the receipt of or cost increases in critical components equipment or raw materials necessary to manufacture our products we may suffer lower operating margins production delays and other material adverse effects 

the cost quality availability and supply of components subassemblies certain equipment and raw materials used to manufacture our products and key components like recording media and heads are critical to our success particularly important for our products are components such as readwrite heads substrates for recording media asics spindle motors printed circuit boards suspension assemblies and nand flash memory in addition the equipment we use to manufacture our products and components is frequently custom made and comes from a few suppliers and the lead times required to obtain manufacturing equipment can be significant our efforts to control our costs including capital expenditures may also affect our ability to obtain or maintain such inputs and equipment which could affect our ability to meet future demand for our products 

we rely on sole or a limited number of direct and indirect suppliers for some or all of these components that we do not manufacture including substrates for recording media readwrite heads asics spindle motors printed circuit boards suspension assemblies and nand flash memory in light of this small consolidated supplier base if our suppliers increased their prices our results of operations would be negatively affected also many of such direct and indirect component suppliers are geographically concentrated making our supply chain more vulnerable to regional disruptions such as severe weather the occurrence of local or global health issues or pandemics such as covid19 acts of terrorism and an unpredictable geopolitical climate which may have a material impact on the production availability and transportation of many components we have experienced and continue to experience disruptions in our supply chain due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic which has also impacted and may adversely impact our operations including without limitation logistical and other operational costs and the operations of some of our key direct and indirect suppliers if our direct and indirect vendors for these components are unable to meet our cost quality supply and transportation requirements continue to remain financially viable or fulfill their contractual commitments and obligations we could experience disruption in our supply chain including shortages in supply or increases in production costs which would materially adversely affect our results of operations the current worldwide shortage of semiconductors may exacerbate these risks 

certain rare earth elements are critical in the manufacture of our products we purchase components that contain rare earth elements from a number of countries including china we cannot predict whether any nation will impose regulations or trade barriers including tariffs duties quotas or embargoes upon the rare earth elements incorporated into our products that would restrict the worldwide supply of such metals or increase their cost we have experienced increased costs and production delays when we were unable to obtain the necessary equipment or sufficient quantities of some components andor have been forced to pay higher prices or make volume purchase commitments or advance deposits for some components equipment or raw materials that were in short supply in the industry in general further if our customers experience shortages of components or materials used in their products it could result in a decrease in demand for our products and have an adverse effect on our results of operations if any major supplier were to restrict the supply available to us or increase the cost of the rare earth elements used in our products we could experience a shortage in supply or an increase in production costs which would adversely affect our results of operations 

shortages or delays in critical components as well as reliance on singlesource suppliers can affect our production and development of products and may harm our operating results  

we are dependent on a limited number of qualified suppliers who provide critical materials or components if there is a shortage of or delay in supplying us with critical components equipment or raw materials then  

• it is likely that our suppliers would raise their prices and if we could not pass these price increases to our customers our operating margin would decline 

• we may have to reengineer some products which would likely cause production and shipment delays make the reengineered products more costly and provide us with a lower rate of return on these products 

• we would likely have to allocate the components we receive to certain of our products and ship less of others which could reduce our revenues and could cause us to lose sales to customers who could purchase more of their required products from manufacturers that either did not experience these shortages or delays or that made different allocations and 

• we may be late in shipping products causing potential customers to make purchases from our competitors thus causing our revenue and operating margin to decline 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain critical components in a timely and economic manner the industry is currently experiencing a global shortage of semiconductors in addition many of our suppliers’ manufacturing facilities are fully utilized if they fail to invest in additional capacity or deliver components in the required timeframe such failure would have an impact on our ability to ramp new products and may result in a loss of revenue or market share if our competitors did not utilize the same components and were not affected  

we often aim to lead the market in new technology deployments and leverage unique and customized technology from single source suppliers who are early adopters in the emerging market our options in supplier selection in these cases are limited and the supplier based technology has been and may continue to be single sourced until wider adoption of the technology occurs and any necessary licenses become available in such cases any technical issues in the supplier’s technology may cause us to delay shipments of our new technology deployments and harm our financial position  

we have a long and unpredictable sales cycle for nearline and mission critical storage solutions which impairs our ability to accurately predict our financial and operating results in any period and may adversely affect our ability to forecast the need for investments and expenditures  

our nearline and mission critical storage solutions are technically complex and we typically supply them in high quantities to a small number of customers many of our products are also tailored to meet the specific requirements of individual customers and are often integrated by our customers into the systems and products that they sell factors that affect the length of our sales cycle include 

• the time required for developing testing and evaluating our products before they are deployed 

• the size of the deployment and 

• the complexity of system configuration necessary to deploy our products 

as a result our sales cycle for nearline and mission critical storage solutions is often in excess of one year and frequently unpredictable given the length of development and qualification programs and unpredictability of the sales cycle we may be unable to accurately forecast product demand which may result in lost sales or excess inventory and associated inventory reserves or writedowns each of which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations  

if revenues fall or customer demand decreases significantly we may not meet all of our purchase commitments to certain suppliers  

from time to time we enter into longterm noncancelable purchase commitments or make large upfront investments with certain suppliers in order to secure certain components or technologies for the production of our products or to supplement our internal manufacturing capacity for certain components if our actual revenues in the future are lower than our projections or if customer demand decreases significantly below our projections we may not meet all of our purchase commitments with these suppliers as a result it is possible that our revenues will not be sufficient to recoup our upfront investments in which case we will have to shift output from our internal manufacturing facilities to these suppliers or make penaltytype payments under the terms of these contracts additionally because our markets are volatile competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes we face inventory and other asset risks in the event we do not fully utilize purchase commitments if we are unable to fully utilize our purchase commitments or if we shift output from our internal manufacturing facilities in order to meet the commitments our gross margin and operating margin could be materially adversely impacted 

due to the complexity of our products some defects may only become detectable after deployment  

our products are highly complex and are designed to operate in and form part of larger complex networks and storage systems our products may contain a defect or be perceived as containing a defect by our customers as a result of improper use or maintenance lead times required to manufacture certain components are significant and a quality excursion may take significant time and resources to remediate defects in our products thirdparty components or in the networks and systems of which they form a part directly or indirectly have resulted in and may in the future result in  

• increased costs and product delays until complex solution level interoperability issues are resolved 

• costs associated with the remediation of any problems attributable to our products 

• loss of or delays in revenues 

• loss of customers 

• failure to achieve market acceptance and loss of market share 

• increased service and warranty costs and 

• increased insurance costs 

defects in our products could also result in legal actions by our customers for property damage injury or death such legal actions including but not limited to product liability claims could exceed the level of insurance coverage that we have obtained any significant uninsured claims could significantly harm our financial condition  

risks related to human capital 

the loss of or inability to attract key executive officers and employees could negatively impact our business prospects  

our future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued service of key members of management as well as marketing sales and product development personnel we believe our future success will also depend in large part upon our ability to attract retain and further motivate highly skilled management marketing sales and product development personnel we have experienced intense competition for qualified and capable personnel including in the us thailand china singapore and northern ireland and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our key employees or that we will be successful in attracting assimilating and retaining personnel in the future additionally because a portion of our key personnel’s compensation is contingent upon the performance of our business including through cash bonuses and equity compensation when the market price of our ordinary shares fluctuates or our results of operations or financial condition are negatively impacted we may be at a competitive disadvantage for retaining and hiring employees the reductions in workforce that result from our historical restructurings have also made and may continue to make it difficult for us to recruit and retain personnel increased difficulty in accessing recruiting or retaining personnel may lead to increased manufacturing and employment compensation costs which could adversely affect our results of operations the loss of one or more of our key personnel or the inability to hire and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to risks related to corporate and social responsibility and reputation 

many factors influence our reputation including the perception held by our customers suppliers partners shareholders other key stakeholders and the communities in which we operate we face increasing scrutiny related to environmental social and governance activities we risk damage to our reputation if we fail to act responsibly in a number of areas such as diversity and inclusion environmental stewardship sustainability supply chain management climate change workplace conduct and human rights any harm to our reputation could impact employee engagement and retention our corporate culture and the willingness of customers suppliers and partners to do business with us which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows further despite our policies to the contrary we may not be able to control the conduct of every individual actor and our employees and personnel may violate environmental social or governance standards or engage in other unethical conduct these acts or any accusation of such conduct even if proven to be false could adversely impact the reputation of our business 

risks related to financial performance or general economic conditions 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations and our investments to meet our liquidity requirements including servicing our indebtedness  

our business may not generate sufficient cash flows to enable us to meet our liquidity requirements including working capital capital expenditures product development efforts investments servicing our indebtedness and other general corporate requirements if we cannot fund our liquidity requirements we may have to reduce or delay capital expenditures product development efforts investments and other general corporate expenditures we cannot assure you that any of these remedies would if necessary be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all or that they would permit us to meet our obligations which would affect our results of operations 

we are leveraged and require significant amounts of cash to service our debt our debt and debt service requirements could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities and reduce our options for capital allocation our high level of debt presents the following risks 

• we are required to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements 

• our substantial leverage increases our vulnerability to economic downturns decreased availability of capital and adverse competitive and industry conditions and could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that are less leveraged 

• our debt service obligations could limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry and could limit our ability to pursue other business opportunities borrow more money for operations or capital in the future and implement our business strategies 

• our level of debt may restrict us from raising or make it more costly to raise additional financing on satisfactory terms to fund working capital capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements and 

• covenants in our debt instruments limit our ability to pay future dividends or make other restricted payments and investments 

in addition in the event that we need to refinance all or a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures or incur additional debt to fund our operations we may not be able to obtain terms as favorable as the terms of our existing debt or refinance our existing debt or incur additional debt to fund our operations at all if prevailing interest rates or other factors result in higher interest rates upon refinancing then the interest expense relating to the refinanced debt would increase furthermore if any rating agency changes our credit rating or outlook our debt and equity securities could be negatively affected which could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt or raise additional capital  

we are subject to counterparty default risks 

we have numerous arrangements with financial institutions that subject us to counterparty default risks including cash and investment deposits and foreign currency forward exchange contracts and other derivative instruments as a result we are subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these arrangements will voluntarily or involuntarily default on its performance obligations in times of market distress in particular a counterparty may not comply with its contractual commitments that could then lead to it defaulting on its obligations with little or no notice to us thereby limiting our ability to take action to lessen or cover our exposure additionally our ability to mitigate our counterparty exposures could be limited by the terms of the relevant agreements or because market conditions prevent us from taking effective action if one of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy our ability to recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterpartys default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty or the applicable laws governing the bankruptcy proceedings in the event of any such counterparty default we could incur significant losses which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

further our customers could have reduced access to working capital due to global economic conditions higher interest rates reduced bank lending resulting from contractions in the money supply or the deterioration in the customer’s or their bank’s financial condition or the inability to access other financing which would increase our credit and nonpayment risk and could result in an increase in our operating costs or a reduction in our revenue also our customers outside of the united states are sometimes allowed longer time periods for payment than our us customers this increases the risk of nonpayment due to the possibility that the financial condition of particular customers may worsen during the course of the payment period in addition some of our oem customers have adopted a subcontractor model that requires us to contract directly with companies such as original design manufacturers that provide manufacturing and fulfillment services to our oem customers because these subcontractors are generally not as well capitalized as our direct oem customers this subcontractor model exposes us to increased credit risks our agreements with our oem customers may not permit us to increase our product prices to alleviate this increased credit risk 

our quarterly results of operations fluctuate sometimes significantly from period to period and may cause our share price to decline  

our quarterly revenue and results of operations fluctuate sometimes significantly from period to period these fluctuations which we expect to continue have been and may continue to be precipitated by a variety of factors including 

• uncertainty in global economic and political conditions or adverse changes in the level of economic activity in the major regions in which we do business 

• pandemics such as covid19 or other global health issues that impact our operations as well as those of our customers and suppliers 

• competitive pressures resulting in lower prices by our competitors which may shift demand away from our products 

• announcements of new products services or technological innovations by us or our competitors and delays or problems in our introduction of new more costeffective products the inability to achieve high production yields or delays in customer qualification or initial product quality issues 

• changes in customer demand or the purchasing patterns or behavior of our customers 

• application of new or revised industry standards 

• disruptions in our supply chain including increased costs or adverse changes in availability of supplies of raw materials or components 

• the impact of corporate restructuring activities that we have and may continue to engage in 

• changes in the demand for the computer systems and data storage products that contain our products 

• unfavorable supply and demand imbalances 

• our high proportion of fixed costs including manufacturing and research and development expenses 

• any impairments in goodwill or other longlived assets 

• changes in tax laws regulatory requirements including export regulations or tariffs or accounting standards and 

• adverse changes in the performance of our products 

as a result we believe that quartertoquarter and yearoveryear comparisons of our revenue and results of operations may not be meaningful and that these comparisons may not be an accurate indicator of our future performance our results of operations in one or more future quarters may fail to meet the expectations of investment research analysts or investors which could cause an immediate and significant decline in our market value 

any cost reduction initiatives that we undertake may not deliver the results we expect and these actions may adversely affect our business  

from time to time we engage in restructuring plans that have resulted and may continue to result in workforce reduction and consolidation of our real estate facilities and our manufacturing footprint in addition management will continue to evaluate our global footprint and cost structure and additional restructuring plans are expected to be formalized as a result of our restructurings we have experienced and may in the future experience a loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge disruptions to our operations and inefficiency during transitional periods additionally global footprint consolidation and reduction in excess capacity may result in us being unable to respond to increases in forecasted volume of customer demand and loss of revenue opportunity if our competitors have underutilized factories any costcutting measures could impact employee retention in addition we cannot be sure that any future cost reductions or global footprint consolidations will deliver the results we expect be successful in reducing our overall expenses as we expect or that additional costs will not offset any such reductions or global footprint consolidation if our operating costs are higher than we expect or if we do not maintain adequate control of our costs and expenses our results of operations may be adversely affected 

changes in the macroeconomic environment may in the future negatively impact our results of operations 

changes in macroeconomic conditions may affect consumer and enterprise spending and as a result our customers may postpone or cancel spending in response to volatility in credit and equity markets negative financial news andor declines in income or asset values all of which may have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products andor result in significant decreases in our product prices other factors that could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and on our financial condition and results of operations include inflation slower growth or recession conditions in the labor market healthcare costs access to credit consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer and business spending behavior 

macroeconomic developments such as the withdrawal of the united kingdom “uk” from the european union “eu” slowing economies in parts of asia and the americas increased tariffs between the us and china mexico and other countries or adverse economic conditions worldwide resulting from the covid19 pandemic and efforts of governments and private industry to slow the pandemic or efforts of governments to stimulate the economy which may increase the risk of significant inflation could negatively affect our business operating results or financial condition which in turn could adversely affect the price of our ordinary shares a general weakening of and related declining corporate confidence in the global economy or the curtailment in government or corporate spending could cause current or potential customers to reduce their information technology “it” budgets or be unable to fund data storage systems which could cause customers to delay decrease or cancel purchases of our products or cause customers not to pay us or to delay paying us for previously purchased products and services  

political events war terrorism natural disasters public health issues and other circumstances could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition  

war terrorism geopolitical uncertainties natural disasters public health issues and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy and thus could have a strong negative effect on our business our direct and indirect suppliers logistics providers manufacturing vendors and customers our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes fires power or water shortages terrorist attacks other hostile acts labor disputes public health issues such as the covid19 pandemic and other events beyond our control such events may decrease demand for our products make it difficult or impossible for us to make and deliver products to our customers or to receive components from our direct and indirect suppliers and create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain 

a significant natural disaster such as an earthquake fire flood or significant power outage could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition the impact of climate change may increase these risks due to changes in weather patterns such as increases in storm intensity sealevel rise melting of permafrost and temperature extremes in areas where we or our suppliers and customers conduct business we have a number of our employees and executive officers located in the san francisco bay area a region known for seismic activity wildfires and drought conditions and in asia near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity to mitigate wildfire risk electric utilities are deploying public safety power shutoffs which affects electricity reliability to our facilities and our communities many of our suppliers and customers are also located in areas with risks of natural disasters for example many of our component suppliers are geographically concentrated in thailand which suffered severe flooding in october 2011 resulting in a material impact on the production and availability of many components which caused significant increases in the cost of components in the event of a natural disaster losses and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected further governmental regulations related to the environment such as singapore’s recent adoption of a law restricting data center development may also adversely affect our customers or our introduction of new products or services resulting in adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations 

should major public health issues including pandemics arise we could be negatively affected by stringent employee travel restrictions additional limitations or cost increases in freight and other logistical services governmental actions limiting the movement of products or employees between regions increases in or changes to data collection and reporting obligations delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in our operations and those of some of our key direct and indirect suppliers and customers for example the recent covid19 pandemic resulted in governmentimposed travel restrictions border closures stayathome orders facility closures or operating constraints in a number of our global locations disruptions in our operations and those of our suppliers partners and customers increases in air freight rates limited numbers of employees available to staff manufacturing operations and shortages of supplies of personal protective equipment required for our manufacturing operations if any of these circumstances continue for an extended period of time our manufacturing ability and capacity or those of our key direct and indirect suppliers or customers could be impacted and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

legal regulatory and compliance risks 

our business is subject to various laws regulations governmental policies litigation governmental investigations or governmental proceedings that may cause us to incur significant expense or adversely impact our results or operations and financial condition  

our business is subject to regulation under a wide variety of us federal and state and nonus laws regulations and policies there can be no assurance that laws regulations and policies will not be changed in ways that will require us to modify our business model and objectives or affect our returns on investments by restricting existing activities and products subjecting them to escalating costs or prohibiting them outright in particular governmental focus on antitrust and competition law improper payments the environment data privacy security and sovereignty currency exchange controls conflict minerals import and export controls complex economic sanctions and the enactment of us tax reform and potential further changes to global tax laws have had and may continue to have an effect on our business corporate structure operations sales liquidity capital requirements effective tax rate results of operations and financial performance china malaysia northern ireland singapore and thailand in which we have significant operating assets and the european union each have exercised and continue to exercise significant influence over many aspects of their domestic economies including but not limited to fair competition tax practices anticorruption antitrust data privacy and sovereignty price controls and international trade 

our business is subject to state federal and international data privacy and data protection regulations involving matters including data use data localization data transfer data storage data retention and deletion data access and data security compliance with these laws and regulations can be onerous and have increased and may continue to increase our cost of doing business globally or otherwise adversely impact financial results our introduction of new products or services changes to our existing products or services or the manner in which our customers utilize our products or services may result in new or enhanced costly compliance requirements or governmental or regulatory scrutiny that could adversely affect our business and financial results data privacy and data protection regulations also continue to change and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may adversely affect our business by requiring changes to our business practices limiting our ability to offer a product or service or making our products or services less attractive to customers laws and regulations related to data transfers including data localization data access and data storage also continue to develop and have been subject to regulatory and judicial scrutiny in many cases these laws apply to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries and among us our subsidiaries and our customers or other parties with which we have commercial relations if we are restricted in our sharing of data among countries and regions in which we operate among our subsidiaries or with third parties with which we have a commercial relationship it may increase our compliance costs and adversely impact our operations the ability to provide our products or services or the manner in which we provide our product or services our business is subject to state federal and international laws and regulations that subject us to requirements to notify vendors customers or employees of a data security breach a data security breach or actual or perceived noncompliance with data privacy and data protection laws could result in damage to our brand including decreased customer demand for our products or services significant financial penalties and liability governmental investigations and proceedings ongoing audit requirements private or class actions and unanticipated changes to our data handling or processing practices we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage is adequate for datahandling or datasecurity liabilities incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim the successful assertion of one or more claims against us that exceed our insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies could have a material adverse effect on our business including our financial condition operating results and reputation for example the european general data protection regulation “gdpr” took effect in may 2018 and applies to our operations and our products and services used by individuals in europe failure to comply with the gdpr could result in significant penalties of up to 4 of our worldwide revenue the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” which took effect in january 2020 imposed substantial compliance requirements and new rights for california consumers violations of the ccpa carry substantial civil penalties and the law creates a private right of action for certain data breaches the california privacy rights act effective january 1 2023 and the colorado privacy act effective july 1 2023 will impose additional privacyrelated requirements that may increase our cost of doing business or adversely affect our business  

further the sale and manufacturing of products in certain states and countries has and may continue to subject us and our suppliers to state federal and international laws and regulations governing protection of the environment including those governing climate change discharges of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites restrictions on the presence of certain substances in electronic products and the responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling we endeavor to ensure that we and our suppliers comply with all applicable environmental laws and regulations however compliance has increased and may continue to increase our operating costs and may otherwise impact future financial results if additional or more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future we could incur additional operating costs and capital expenditures if we fail to comply with applicable environmental laws regulations initiatives or standards of conduct our customers may refuse to purchase our products and we could be subject to fines penalties and possible prohibition of sales of our products into one or more states or countries liability to our customers and damage to our reputation which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

sec rules require certain disclosures regarding the use of specified minerals often referred to as conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured these rules could affect our ability to source directly or indirectly certain materials used in our products at competitive prices and could impact the availability of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products including gold tantalum tin and tungsten as there may be only a limited number of suppliers of “conflict free” minerals we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary conflict free minerals in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices our customers including our oem customers may require that our products be free of conflict minerals and our revenues and margins may be harmed if we are unable to procure conflict free minerals at a reasonable price or at all or are unable to pass through any increased costs associated with meeting these demands we may also face challenges with government regulators and our customers and suppliers if we are unable to sufficiently verify that the metals used in our products are conflict free furthermore our customers and manufacturing stakeholders may place increased demands on our compliance framework which may in turn negatively impact our relationships with our suppliers if we are unable to comply with requirements regarding the use of conflict and other minerals our business financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

from time to time we have been and may continue to be involved in various legal regulatory or administrative investigations inquiries negotiations or proceedings arising in the normal course of business  in the event of litigation government investigations or governmental proceedings we are subject to the inherent risks and uncertainties that may result if outcomes differ from our expectations in the event of adverse outcomes in any litigation investigation or government proceeding we could be required to pay substantial damages fines or penalties and cease certain practices or activities which could materially harm our business the costs associated with litigation and government investigations can also be unpredictable depending on the complexity and length of time devoted to such litigation or investigation litigation investigations or government proceedings may also divert the efforts and attention of our key personnel which could also harm our business  

in addition regulation or government scrutiny may impact the requirements for marketing our products and slow our ability to introduce new products resulting in an adverse impact on our business although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate these or other applicable laws rules and regulations to which we are and may be subject violations of these laws and regulations could lead to significant penalties restraints on our export or import privileges monetary fines government investigations disruption of our operating activities damage to our reputation and corporate brand criminal proceedings and regulatory or other actions that could materially adversely affect our results of operations the political and media scrutiny surrounding a governmental investigation for the violation of such laws even if an investigation does not result in a finding of violation could cause us significant expense and collateral consequences including reputational harm that could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

some of our products and services are subject to export control laws and other laws affecting the countries in which our products and services may be sold distributed or delivered and any changes to or violation of these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

due to the global nature of our business we are subject to import and export restrictions and regulations including the export administration regulations administered by the us commerce department’s bureau of industry and security “bis” and the trade and economic sanctions regulations administered by the us treasury department’s office of foreign assets control “ofac” we incorporate encryption technology into certain of our products and solutions these encryption products and the underlying technology may be exported outside of the united states only with export authorizations including by license a license exception or other appropriate government authorizations including the filing of an encryption registration the us through the bis and ofac places restrictions on the sale or export of certain products and services to certain countries persons and entities as well as for certain enduses such as military militaryintelligence and weapons of mass destruction enduses the us government also imposes sanctions through executive orders restricting us companies from conducting business activities with specified individuals and companies although we have controls and procedures to ensure compliance with all applicable regulations and orders we cannot predict whether changes in laws or regulations by the us china or another country will affect our ability to sell our products and services to existing or new customers additionally we cannot ensure that our interpretation of relevant restrictions and regulations will be accepted in all cases by relevant regulatory and enforcement authorities 

violators of any us export control and sanctions laws may be subject to significant penalties which may include monetary fines criminal proceedings against them and their officers and employees a denial of export privileges and suspension or debarment from selling products to the us government moreover the sanctions imposed by the us government could be expanded in the future our products could be shipped to those targets or for restricted enduses by third parties including potentially our channel partners despite our precautions in addition if our partners fail to obtain appropriate import export or reexport licenses or permits we may also be adversely affected through reputational harm as well as other negative consequences including government investigations and penalties a significant portion of our sales are to customers which are located in geographies that have been the focus of recent changes in us policies any limitation that impedes our ability to export or sell our products and services could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

other countries also regulate the import and export of certain encryption and other technology including import and export licensing requirements and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to sell or distribute our products and services or could limit our partners’ or customers’ ability to sell or use our products and services in those countries which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition violations of these regulations may result in significant penalties and fines changes in our products and services or future changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products and services in those countries prevent our customers from deploying our products and services globally or in some cases prevent the export or import or sale of our products and services to certain countries governments or persons altogether from time to time various governmental agencies have proposed additional regulation of encryption technology including the escrow and government recovery of private encryption keys any change in export or import regulations economic sanctions or related legislation increased export and import controls or change in the countries governments persons or technologies targeted by such regulations in the countries where we operate could result in decreased use of our products and services by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products and services to new or existing customers which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we were ever found to have violated applicable export control laws we may be subject to various penalties available under the laws any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition even if we were not found to have violated such laws the political and media scrutiny surrounding any governmental investigation of us could cause us significant expense and reputational harm such collateral consequences could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

changes in us trade policy including the imposition of sanctions or tariffs and the resulting consequences may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

we face uncertainty with regard to us government trade policy current us government trade policy includes tariffs on certain nonus goods including information and communication technology products these measures may materially increase costs for goods imported into the united states this in turn could require us to materially increase prices to our customers which may reduce demand or if we are unable to increase prices to adequately address any tariffs quotas or duties could lower our margin on products sold and negatively impact our financial performance changes in us trade policy have resulted in and could result in more us trading partners adopting responsive trade policies including imposition of increased tariffs quotas or duties such policies could make it more difficult or costly for us to export our products to those countries therefore negatively impacting our financial performance 

we may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations  

we rely on a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws confidentiality agreements security measures and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights in the past we have been involved in significant and expensive disputes regarding our intellectual property rights and those of others including claims that we may be infringing patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties we expect that we will be involved in similar disputes in the future  

there can be no assurance tha t 

• any of our existing patents will continue to be held valid if challenged 

• patents will be issued for any of our pending applications 

• any claims allowed from existing or pending patents will have sufficient scope or strength to protect us 

• our patents will be issued in the primary countries where our products are sold in order to protect our rights and potential commercial advantage 

• we will be able to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality agreements with our customers suppliers and employees and through other security measures and 

• others will not gain access to our trade secrets 

in addition our competitors may be able to design their products around our patents and other proprietary rights enforcement of our rights often requires litigation if we bring a patent infringement action and are not successful our competitors would be able to use similar technology to compete with us moreover the defendant in such an action may successfully countersue us for infringement of their patents or assert a counterclaim that our patents are invalid or unenforceable  

furthermore we have significant operations and sales in countries where intellectual property laws and enforcement policies are often less developed less stringent or more difficult to enforce than in the united states therefore we cannot be certain that we will be able to protect our intellectual property rights in jurisdictions outside the united states  

we are at times subject to intellectual property proceedings and claims which could cause us to incur significant additional costs or prevent us from selling our products and which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition  

we are subject from timetotime to legal proceedings and claims including claims of alleged infringement of the patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties by us or our customers in connection with the use of our products intellectual property litigation can be expensive and timeconsuming regardless of the merits of any claim and could divert our management’s attention from operating our business in addition intellectual property lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties due to the complexity of the technical issues involved which may cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations some of the actions that we face from timetotime seek injunctions against the sale of our products andor substantial monetary damages which if granted or awarded could materially harm our business financial condition and operating results  

we cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of others we may not be aware of currently filed patent applications that relate to our products or technology if patents are later issued on these applications we may be liable for infringement if our products were found to infringe the intellectual property rights of others we could be required to pay substantial damages cease the manufacture use and sale of infringing products in one or more geographic locations expend significant resources to develop noninfringing technology discontinue the use of specific processes or obtain licenses to the technology infringed we might not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms or at all or be able to reengineer our products successfully to avoid infringement any of the foregoing could cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling our products which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data — note 14 legal environmental and other contingencies ” contained in this report for a description of pending intellectual property proceedings  

our business and certain products and services depend in part on ip and technology licensed from third parties as well as data centers and infrastructure operated by third parties 

some of our business and some of our products rely on or include software licensed from third parties including open source licenses we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses from these third parties at all or on reasonable terms or such third parties may demand crosslicenses to our intellectual property thirdparty components and technology may become obsolete defective or incompatible with future versions of our products or services or our relationship with the third party may deteriorate or our agreements may expire or be terminated we may face legal or business disputes with licensors that may threaten or lead to the disruption of inbound licensing relationships in order to remain in compliance with the terms of our licenses we monitor and manage our use of thirdparty software including both proprietary and open source license terms to avoid subjecting our products and services to conditions we do not intend such as the licensing or public disclosure of our intellectual property without compensation or on undesirable terms the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by us courts and these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products or services additionally some of these licenses may not be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable or that allow our product offerings to remain competitive our inability to obtain licenses or rights on favorable terms could have a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow including if we are required to take remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts 

in addition we also rely upon thirdparty hosted infrastructure partners globally to serve customers and operate certain aspects of our business or services any disruption of or interference at our hosted infrastructure partners would impact our operations and our business could be adversely impacted 

risks related to information technology data and information security 

we could suffer a loss of revenue and increased costs exposure to significant liability including legal and regulatory consequences reputational harm and other serious negative consequences in the event of cyberattacks ransomware or other cyber security breaches or incidents that disrupt our operations or result in the dissemination of proprietary or confidential information of our customers or about us or our customers or other third parties  

our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer equipment and the electronic data stored in our databases we manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our operations as well as customers and suppliers and we will store subscribers’ data on our edgetocloud mass storage platform as our operations become more automated and increasingly interdependent and our edgetocloud mass storage platform service grows our exposure to the risks posed by storage transfer and maintenance of data such as corruption loss or unavailability of or damage to and other security risks to data will continue to increase we use thirdparty vendors to store and otherwise process data for us and they face similar risks the measures we and our vendors have implemented to secure our computer equipment and our and our customers’ data have been and may continue to be vulnerable to phishing employee error hacking ransomware and other cyberattacks malfeasance system error or other irregularities or incidents including from breaches and incidents or attacks at third party vendors we utilize and may not be sufficient for all eventualities including sustained maintenance of remote working requirements we cannot ensure that any limitationofliability provisions in our customer and user agreements contracts with thirdparty vendors and service providers or other contracts are enforceable or adequate or would protect us from any liabilities or damages with respect to claims relating to a security breach or other securityrelated matter experienced computer programmers and threat actors may be able to penetrate our network security misappropriate or compromise our confidential information and other data or that of our customers suppliers or other third parties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns computer programmers and threat actors also may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our products and services or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products and services such attempts are increasing in technical sophistication number and the ability to evade detection or to obscure such activities we anticipate that these threats will continue to grow in scope and complexity over time because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures although we take steps to protect against and detect such attempts our efforts may not be sufficient for all eventualities including sustained maintenance of remote working requirements in addition sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture including “bugs” and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system or our services  we have been and will likely continue to be subject to computer viruses or other malicious code cyberattacks or other computerrelated attempts to breach the it systems we use for these purposes we have been and may also continue to be subject to it system failures and network disruptions due to these factors to date these attacks have not had a material impact on our operations but we cannot provide assurance that they will not have a material impact in the future the insurance coverage we maintain that is intended to address certain data security risks may be insufficient to cover all types of claims or losses that may arise and has been increasing in price over time we cannot be certain that insurance coverage will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all 

the costs to us to eliminate or address the foregoing security problems and security vulnerabilities before or after a security breach or incident could be significant system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate certain legacy it systems may not be easily remediated and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions we could lose existing or potential customers for cloud and outsourcing services or other it solutions in connection with any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services some of our products and services contain encryption and other measures implemented in an effort to protect thirdparty content stored on our products such measures may be compromised breached or circumvented or otherwise fail and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of our our customers’ or third parties’ confidential information may occur security breaches or incidents and unauthorized access to or loss corruption unavailability or the unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers or other third parties has exposed us and could expose us our vendors and customers or other third parties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information and result in litigation or governmental investigations fines penalties indemnity obligations and other potential liability and costs for us materially damage our brand or otherwise materially harm our business in addition we rely in certain capacities on thirdparty data management providers whose possible security problems and security vulnerabilities may have similar effects on us our business brand and reputation could also be materially adversely affected by media or other reports of perceived security vulnerabilities in our products services network or processes even if unsubstantiated  

we must successfully maintain and upgrade our it systems and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations  

from time to time we expand and improve our it systems to support our business going forward consequently we are in the process of implementing and will continue to invest in and implement modifications and upgrades to our it systems and procedures including making changes to legacy systems or acquiring new systems with new functionality and building new policies procedures training programs and monitoring tools including in connection with the sustained maintenance of remote working requirements for example we are currently implementing a new global enterprise resource planning system which is a multiyear process these types of activities subject us to inherent costs and risks associated with changing and acquiring these systems policies procedures and monitoring tools including capital expenditures additional operating expenses demands on management time and other risks and costs of delays or difficulties in transitioning to or integrating new systems policies procedures or monitoring tools into our current systems these implementations modifications and upgrades may not result in productivity improvements at a level that outweighs the costs of implementation or at all in addition difficulties with implementing new technology systems delays in our timeline for planned improvements significant system failures or our inability to successfully modify our it systems policies procedures or monitoring tools to respond to changes in our business needs have caused and may continue to cause disruptions in our business operations increase data security risks and may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to owning our ordinary shares 

the price of our ordinary shares may be volatile and could decline significantly  

the market price of our ordinary shares has experienced price fluctuations and could be subject to wide fluctuations in the future the market price of our ordinary shares has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate or decline significantly in response to various factors some of which are beyond our control including  

• general stock market conditions or general uncertainty in stock market conditions due to global economic conditions and negative financial news unrelated to our business or industry including the impact of the covid19 pandemic 

• the timing and amount of or the discontinuance of our share repurchases 

• actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations 

• announcements of innovations new products significant contracts acquisitions or significant price reductions by us or our competitors including those competitors who offer alternative storage technology solutions 

• our failure to meet our guidance or the performance estimates of investment research analysts or changes in financial estimates by investment research analysts 

• significant announcements by or changes in financial condition of a large customer 

• actual or perceived security breaches or security vulnerabilities 

• the occurrence of major catastrophic events  including natural disasters acts of war or climate change 

• actual or anticipated changes in the credit ratings of our indebtedness by rating agencies and 

• the sale of our ordinary shares held by certain equity investors or members of management 

in addition in the past following periods of decline in the market price of a company’s securities class action lawsuits have often been pursued against that company if similar litigation were pursued against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

any decision to reduce or discontinue the payment of cash dividends to our shareholders or the repurchase of our ordinary shares pursuant to our previously announced share repurchase program could cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline significantly  

although historically we have announced regular cash dividend payments and a share repurchase program we are under no obligation to pay cash dividends to our shareholders in the future at historical levels or at all or to repurchase our ordinary shares at any particular price or at all the declaration and payment of any future dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors our previously announced share repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time our payment of quarterly cash dividends and the repurchase of our ordinary shares pursuant to our share repurchase program are subject to among other things our financial position and results of operations distributable reserves available cash and cash flow capital and regulatory requirements market and economic conditions our ordinary share price and other factors any reduction or discontinuance by us of the payment of quarterly cash dividends or the repurchase of our ordinary shares pursuant to our share repurchase program could cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline significantly moreover in the event our payment of quarterly cash dividends or repurchases of our ordinary shares are reduced or discontinued our failure to resume such activities at historical levels could result in a persistent lower market valuation of our ordinary shares

impact of covid19

liquidity sources 

our primary sources of liquidity as of july 2 2021 consist of 1 approximately 12 billion in cash and cash equivalents 2 cash we expect to generate from operations and 3 1725 billion available for borrowing under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility “revolving credit facility” which is part of our credit agreement the “credit agreement” 

as of july 2 2021 no borrowings including swing line loans were outstanding and no commitments were utilized for letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility is available for borrowings subject to compliance with financial covenants and other customary conditions to borrowing

as of july 2 2021 cash and cash equivalents held by nonirish subsidiaries was 12 billion this amount is potentially subject to taxation in ireland upon repatriation by means of a dividend into our irish parent however it is our intent to indefinitely reinvest earnings of nonirish subsidiaries outside of ireland and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate such earnings by means of a taxable irish dividend should funds be needed in the irish parent company and should we be unable to fund parent company activities through means other than a taxable irish dividend we would be required to accrue and pay irish taxes on such dividend 

we believe that our sources of cash will be sufficient to fund our operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months for additional information on factors that could impact our ability to fund our operations and meet our cash requirements including the covid19 pandemic see the section entitled “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this annual report 

cash requirements and commitments 

our liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital product development and capital expenditure needs to fund scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness and to fund our quarterly dividend and any future strategic investments our ability to fund these requirements will depend on our future cash flows which are determined by future operating performance and therefore subject to prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and financial business and other factors some of which are beyond our control 

from time to time we may repurchase any of our outstanding senior notes in open market or privately negotiated purchases or o therwise or we may repurchase outstanding senior notes pursuant to the terms of the applicable indenture 

on july 19 2021 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 067 per share which will be payable on october 6 2021 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on september 22 2021 

as of july 2 2021 we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our debt agreements based on our current outlook and the information we currently have available to us we expect to be in compliance with the covenants in our debt agreements over the next 12 months 

the carrying value of our debt as of july 2 2021 and july 3 2020 was 51 billion and 42 billion respectively the table below presents the principal amounts of our outstanding debt 



from time to time at the company’s discretion we may repurchase any of our outstanding ordinary shares through private open market or broker assisted purchases tender offers or other means including through the use of derivative transactions our board of directors increased the authorization for the repurchase of our outstanding ordinary shares by 30 billion on october 21 2020 and 20 billion on february 22 2021 during fiscal year 2021 we repurchased approximately 34 million of our ordinary shares including shares withheld for statutory tax withholdings related to vesting of employee equity awards see “item 5 market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securitiesrepurchases of our equity securities” as of july 2 2021 42 billion remained available for repurchase under our existing repurchase authorization limit we may limit or terminate the repurchase program at any time all repurchases are effected as redemptions in accordance with our constitution 

for fiscal year 2022 we expect capital expenditures to be aligned to our updated longterm targeted range of 4 to 6 of revenue we require substantial amounts of cash to fund any increased working capital requirements future capital expenditures scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness and payments of dividends we will continue to evaluate and manage the retirement and replacement of existing debt and associated obligations including evaluating the issuance of new debt securities exchanging existing debt securities for other debt securities and retiring debt pursuant to privately negotiated transactions open market purchases tender offers or other means or otherwise in addition we may selectively pursue strategic alliances acquisitions joint ventures and investments which may require additional capital 

contractual obligations and commitments 

our contractual cash obligations and commitments as of july 2 2021 are summarized in the table below 



 

1 purchase obligations are defined as contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services which are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms 

2 includes total future minimum rent expense under noncancelable leases for both occupied and vacated facilities rent expense is shown net of sublease income refer to “ item 8 financial statements and supplementary data— note 6 leases” for details 

as of july 2 2021 we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits and an accrual for the payment of related interest totaling 3 million none of which is expected to be settled within one year outside of one year we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlement with a taxing authority will occur 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of july 2 2021 we did not have any material offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of regulation sk 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the methods estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements the sec has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are highly uncertain at the time of estimation based on this definition our most critical accounting policies include revenue  sales program accruals warranty and income taxes below we discuss these policies further as well as the estimates and judgments involved we also have other accounting policies and accounting estimates relating to uncollectible customer accounts valuation of inventories assessing goodwill and other longlived assets for impairment valuation of sharebased payments and restructuring we believe that these other accounting policies and accounting estimates either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective or it is less likely that they would have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period 

revenue  sales program accruals we record estimated variable consideration at the time of revenue recognition as a reduction to revenue variable consideration generally consists of sales incentive programs such as price protection and volume incentives aimed at increasing customer demand for oem sales rebates are typically established by estimating the most likely amount of consideration expected to be received based on an oem customers volume of purchases from us or other agreed upon rebate programs for the distribution and retail channel these sales incentive programs typically involve estimating the most likely amount of rebates related to a customers level of sales order size advertising or point of sale activity as well as the expected value of price protection adjustments based on historical analysis and forecasted pricing environment total sales programs were 14 12 and 11 of gross revenue in fiscal years 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively adjustments to revenues due to under or over accruals for sales programs related to revenues reported in prior quarterly periods were less than 1 of gross revenue in fiscal years 2021 2020 and 2019 

warranty we estimate probable product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized we generally provide a warranty on our products for a period of 1 to 5 years our warranty provision considers estimated product failure rates and trends including the timing of product returns during the warranty periods and estimated repair or replacement costs related to product quality issues if any we also exercise judgment in estimating our ability to sell refurbished products based on historical experience our judgment is subject to a greater degree of subjectivity with respect to newly introduced products because of limited experience with those products upon which to base our warranty estimates 

income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits recognition of income and deductions and calculation of specific tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for income tax and financial statement purposes as well as tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions the calculation of tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by various taxing authorities if estimates of these tax liabilities are greater or less than actual results an additional tax provision or benefit will result the deferred tax assets we record each period depend primarily on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states and certain nonus jurisdictions each period we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and if necessary adjust the valuation allowance so that net deferred tax assets are recorded only to the extent we conclude it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized if our outlook for future taxable income changes significantly our assessment of the need for and the amount of a valuation allowance may also change 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data— note 1 basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies” for information regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we have exposure to market risks due to the volatility of interest rates foreign currency exchange rates credit rating changes and equity and bond markets a portion of these risks may be hedged but fluctuations could impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash investment portfolio as of july 2 2021 we had no availableforsale debt securities that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for a period greater than 12 months we determined no availableforsale debt securities were otherthantemporarily impaired as of july 2 2021 

we have fixed rate and variable rate debt obligations we enter into debt obligations for general corporate purposes including capital expenditures and working capital needs our term loan bears interest at a variable rate equal to london interbank offered rate “libor” plus a variable margin set on june 17 2021 

in the quarter ended october 4 2019 we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of 500 million to convert the variable interest rate on the term loan to fixed interest rates the contracts were effective as of october 4 2019 and will mature on september 16 2025 the notional amount of the interest rate swap agreements was 481 million as of july 2 2021 the objective of the interest rate swap agreements is to eliminate the variability of interest payment cash flows associated with the variable interest rate on the term loan the company designated the interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges 

the table below presents principal amounts and related fixed or weightedaverage interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio and debt obligations as of july 2 2021 



foreign currency exchange risk from time to time we may enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposure related to certain foreign currency commitments and anticipated foreign currency denominated expenditures our policy prohibits us from entering into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 

we hedge portions of our foreign currency denominated balance sheet positions with foreign currency forward exchange contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings will be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates the change in fair value of these contracts is recognized in earnings in the same period as the gains and losses from the remeasurement of the assets and liabilities all foreign currency forward exchange contracts mature within 12 months 

we recognized a net gain of 14 million and a net loss of 7 million in cost of revenue and interest expense related to the loss of hedge designations on discontinued cash flow hedges during fiscal year 2021 respectively we recognized 4 million in other expense net related to hedge ineffectiveness and discontinued cash flow hedges during fiscal year 2020 

the table below provides information as of july 2 2021 about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts the table is provided in dollar equivalent amounts and presents the notional amounts at the contract exchange rates and the weightedaverage contractual foreign currency exchange rates 



 

1 equivalent to the unrealized net gain loss on existing contracts 

other market risks we have exposure to counterparty credit downgrades in the form of credit risk related to our foreign currency forward exchange contracts and our fixed income portfolio we monitor and limit our credit exposure for our foreign currency forward exchange contracts by performing ongoing credit evaluations we also manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with any one counterparty and we maintain limits on maximum tenor of contracts based on the credit rating of the financial institution additionally the investment portfolio is diversified and structured to minimize credit risk 

changes in our corporate issuer credit ratings have minimal impact on our near term financial results but downgrades may negatively impact our future ability to raise capital our ability to execute transactions with various counterparties and may increase the cost of such capital 

we are subject to equity market risks due to changes in the fair value of the notional investments selected by our employees as part of our nonqualified deferred compensation plan—the seagate deferred compensation plan the “sdcp” the sdcp is a successor plan to the prior seagate deferred compensation plans as amended from time to time under which no additional deferrals may be made after december 31 2014 in fiscal year 2014 we entered into a total return swap “trs” in order to manage the equity market risks associated with the sdcp liabilities we pay a floating rate based on the libor plus an interest rate spread on the notional amount of the trs the trs is designed to substantially offset changes in the sdcp liabilities due to changes in the value of the investment options made by employees see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data— note 8 derivative financial instruments” of this report on form 10k

 item 1 business 

we are a leading provider of data storage technology and solutions our principal products are hard disk drives commonly referred to as disk drives hard drives or hdds in addition to hdds we produce a broad range of data storage products including solid state drives “ssds” solid state hybrid drives “sshds” and storage subsystems 

hdds are devices that store digitally encoded data on rapidly rotating disks with magnetic surfaces hdds continue to be the primary medium of mass data storage due to their performance attributes reliability high quality and cost effectiveness complementing existing storage architectures ssds use integrated circuit assemblies as memory to store data and most ssds use nand flash memory in contrast to hdds and ssds sshds combine the features of ssds and hdds in the same unit containing a highcapacity hdd and a smaller ssd acting as a cache to improve performance of frequently accessed data 

our hdd products are designed for mass capacity storage and legacy markets these markets were previously categorized as enterprise servers and storage systems edge noncompute applications and edge compute applications our hdd and ssd product portfolio includes serial advanced technology attachment “sata” serial attached scsi “sas” and nonvolatile memory express “nvme” based designs to support a wide variety of mass capacity and legacy applications 

our enterprise data solutions “eds” portfolio includes storage subsystems for enterprises cloud service providers scaleout storage servers and original equipment manufacturers “oems” engineered for modularity mobility capacity and performance these solutions include our enterprise hdds and ssds enabling customers to integrate powerful scalable storage within legacy environments or build new ecosystems from the ground up in a secure costeffective manner 

industry overview 

data storage industry 

the data storage industry includes companies that manufacture components or subcomponents designed for data storage devices as well as companies that provide storage solutions software and services for enterprise cloud big data computing platforms and consumer markets the rapid growth of data generation and the intelligent application of data are driving demand for data storage as more data is created at endpoints outside traditional data centers requiring processing at the edge and in the core or cloud the need for data storage and management has also increased these use cases include autonomous vehicles smart manufacturing systems and smart cities we believe the proliferation and personal creation of mediarich digital content further enabled by fifthgeneration wireless “5g” the edge the internet of things “iot” and artificial intelligence “ai” will continue to create demand for higher capacity storage solutions the new ecosystem is expected to require increasing amounts of data storage both at the edge and in the core 

markets 

the principal data storage markets include 

mass capacity storage markets 

mass capacity storage supports high capacity lowcost per terabyte “tb” storage applications including nearline video and image applications and networkattached storage “ nas” mass capacity storage markets represent growing markets that have been increasing as a percentage of our total revenue and in total exabytes shipped in fiscal years 2020 2019 and 2018 with this trend expected to continue in fiscal year 2021 

nearline nearline applications require mass capacity devices hdds as well as mass capacity eds subsystems that provide endtoend solutions to businesses for the purpose of modular and scalable storage enterprise storage applications require both highcapacity and energy efficient storage devices to support low total cost of ownership the eds solutions may also offer file management systems software and compute capabilities to enable both private and public data center applications we expect this market which includes storage for cloud computing content delivery and backup services to continue to grow and drive increasing exabyte demand 

video and image and nas video and image applications and nas drives are specifically designed to ensure the appropriate performance and reliability of the system for surveillance environments video and image and network storage environments nas we expect these markets which includes storage for security and smart video installations to show long term secular growth in exabyte demand 

s 

legacy markets 

legacy markets include mission critical desktop notebook consumer dvr and gaming applications we continue to service these markets but do not plan significant additional investment these markets have been decreasing as a percentage of our total revenue in fiscal years 2020 2019 and 2018 and this trend is expected to continue in fiscal year 2021 and the long term outlook is for a decrease in demand for exabytes in these markets 

mission critical storage mission critical applications are defined as those that use very high performance enterprise class hdds and ssds with sophisticated firmware to reliably support very high workloads we expect that enterprises utilizing dedicated storage area networks will continue to drive market demand for mission critical enterprise storage solutions 

consumer storage consumer applications are externally connected storage both hdd and ssdbased used to provide backup capabilities augmented storage capacity or portable storage for pcs and mobile devices 

desktop and notebook storage these applications rely on low costperhdd and ssd devices to provide builtin storage for a wide variety of consumer and business applications 

gaming storage this market includes storage for pcbased gaming rigs as well as console gaming applications the products are optimized for the speed and responsiveness gamers require and include both internal and external storage options based on hdds and ssds 

dvr dvr applications are hdd storage for video streaming in alwayson consumer premise equipment like dvrs and media centers 

participants in the data storage industry include 

major subcomponent manufacturers companies that manufacture components or subcomponents used in data storage devices or solutions include companies that supply spindle motors heads and media and application specific integrated circuits “asics” 

storage device manufacturers companies that transform components into storage products include disk drive manufacturers and semiconductor storage manufacturers that integrate flash memory into storage products such as ssds 

storage solutions manufacturers and system integrators companies such as oems that bundle and package storage solutions distributors that integrate storage hardware and software into enduser applications cloud service providers “csps” that provide cloud based solutions to businesses for the purpose of scaleout storage solutions and modular systems and producers of solutions such as storage racks 

hyperscale data centers large hyperscale data center companies many of which are csps are increasingly designing their own storage subsystems and having them built by contract manufacturers for use inside their own data centers this trend is reshaping the storage system and subsystem market driving both innovation in system design and changes in the competitive landscape of large storage system vendors 

storage services companies that provide and host services and solutions which include storage backup archiving recovery and discovery of data 

  

demand for data storage 

the international data corporation “idc” forecasts in the 2020 seagatesponsored data age 2025 study that the global datasphere should grow from 59 zettabytes in 2020 to 175 zettabytes by 2025 according to idc we are fast approaching a new era of the data age which we expect will have a positive impact on storage demand the digital transformation has given rise to many new applications all of which rely on faster access to and secure storage of data proliferating from endpoints through edge to cloud 

the data age 2025 study found that data is shifting to both the core and the edge and by 2025 nearly 80 of the world’s data will be stored in the core and edge up from 35 in 2015 

as more applications require realtime decision making some data processing and storage is moving closer to the network edge we believe this will result in a buildup of private and edge cloud environments that will enable fast and secure access to data throughout the iot ecosystem according to idc nearly 25 of the global datasphere will be realtime by 2025 

factors contributing to the growth of digital content include 

• creation sharing and consumption of mediarich content such as highresolution photos high definition videos and digital music through smart phones tablets digital cameras personal video cameras dvrs gaming consoles or other digital devices 

s 

• increasing use of video and imaging sensors to collect and analyze data used to improve traffic flow emergency response times and manufacturing production costs as well as for new surveillance systems that feature higher resolution digital cameras and thus require larger data storage capacities 

• creation and collection of data through the development and evolution of the iot ecosystem big data analytics ai and new technology trends such as autonomous vehicles and drones smart manufacturing and smart cities 

• the growing use of analytics especially for action on data created at the edge instead of processing and analyzing at the data center which is particularly important for verticals such as autonomous vehicles property monitoring systems smart manufacturing and others 

• cloud migration initiatives and the ongoing advancement of the cloud including the build out of large numbers of cloud data centers by csps and private companies transitioning onsite data centers into the cloud and 

• need for protection of increased digital content through redundant storage on backup devices and externally provided storage services 

as a result of these factors we anticipate that the nature and volume of data being created will require greater storage capability which is more efficiently and economically facilitated by higher capacity mass storage devices 

in addition the economics of storage infrastructure are also evolving the utilization of public and private hyperscale storage and opensource solutions is reducing the total cost of ownership of storage while increasing the speed and efficiency with which customers can leverage massive computing and storage devices accordingly we expect these trends will continue to create significant demand for data storage products and solutions going forward 

demand trends 

we believe that continued growth in digital content creation will require increasingly higher storage capacity in order to store aggregate host distribute analyze manage protect back up and use such content we also believe that as architectures evolve to serve a growing commercial and consumer user base throughout the world storage solutions will evolve as well 

mass capacity is and will continue to be the enabler of scale we expect increased data creation will lead to the expansion of the need for storage in the form of hdds eds and ssds while the advance of solid state technology in many end markets is expected to increase we believe that in the foreseeable future cloud edge and traditional enterprise which require highcapacity storage solutions will be best served by hdds due to their ability to deliver the most cost effective reliable and energyefficient mass storage devices we also believe that as hdd capacities continue to increase a focus exclusively on unit demand does not reflect the increase in demand for exabytes as demand for higher capacity drives increases the demand profile has shifted to reflect fewer total hdd units but with higher average capacity per drive and higher overall exabyte demand 

industry supply balance 

from time to time the storage industry has experienced periods of imbalance between supply and demand to the extent that the storage industry builds or maintains capacity based on expectations of demand that do not materialize price erosion may become more pronounced conversely during periods where demand exceeds supply price erosion is generally muted 

our business 

data storage technologies 

the design and manufacturing of hdds depends on highly advanced technology and manufacturing techniques therefore it requires high levels of research and development spending and capital equipment investments we design fabricate and assemble a number of the most important components in our disk drives including readwrite heads and recording media our design and manufacturing operations are based on technology platforms that are used to produce various disk drive products that serve multiple data storage applications and markets our core technology platforms including innovations like the throughputoptimizing multi actuator mach2 technology and the highcapacity enabling heatassisted magnetic recording “hamr” technology focus on the areal density of media and readwrite head technologies this design and manufacturing approach allows us to deliver a portfolio of storage products to service a wide range of data storage applications and industries 

s 

disk drives that we manufacture are commonly differentiated by the following key characteristics 

• inputoutput operations per second “iops” commonly expressed in megabytes per second which is the maximum number of reads and writes to a storage location 

• storage capacity commonly expressed in tb which is the amount of data that can be stored on the disk drive 

• spindle rotation speed commonly expressed in revolutions per minute “rpm” which has an effect on speed of access to data 

• interface transfer rate commonly expressed in megabytes per second which is the rate at which data moves between the disk drive and the computer controller 

• average seek time commonly expressed in milliseconds which is the time needed to position the heads over a selected track on the disk surface 

• data transfer rate commonly expressed in megabytes per second which is the rate at which data is transferred to and from the disk drive 

• product quality and reliability commonly expressed in annualized return rates and 

• energy efficiency commonly measured by the power output necessary to operate the disk drive 

areal density is measured by storage capacity per square inch on the recording surface of a disk the storage capacity of a disk drive is determined by the size and number of disks it contains as well as the areal density capability of these disks 

we also offer ssds as part of our storage solutions portfolio our portfolio includes devices with sata sas and nvme interfaces the ssds differ from hdds in that they are without mechanical parts 

ssds store data on nand flash memory cells or metaloxide semiconductor transistors using a charge on a capacitor to represent a binary digit ssd technology offers fast access to data and robust performance ssds complement hyperscale applications highdensity data centers cloud environments and web servers they are also used in missioncritical enterprise applications consumer gaming and nas applications 

the sshds that we manufacture contain technology that fuses some features of ssds and hdds they include high capacity hdds with flash memory that acts as a cache to improve performance of frequently accessed data and are primarily targeted at pc gaming applications 

manufacturing 

we primarily design and manufacture our own readwrite heads and recording media which are critical technologies for disk drives this integrated approach enables us to lower costs and to improve the functionality of components so that they work together efficiently 

we believe that because of our vertical design and manufacturing strategy we are well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities to leverage the close interdependence of components for disk drives our manufacturing efficiency and flexibility are critical elements of our integrated business strategy we continuously seek to improve our manufacturing efficiency and reduce manufacturing costs by 

• employing manufacturing automation 

• employing machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence 

• improving product quality and reliability 

• integrating our supply chain with suppliers and customers to enhance our demand visibility and reduce our working capital requirements 

• coordinating between our manufacturing group and our research and development organization to rapidly achieve volume manufacturing and 

• operating our facilities at optimal capacities 

a vertically integrated model however tends to have less flexibility when demand declines as it exposes us to higher unit costs when capacity utilization is not optimized 

s 

components and raw materials 

disk drives incorporate certain components including a head disk assembly and a printed circuit board mounted to the head disk assembly which are sealed inside a rigid base and top cover containing the recording components in a contamination controlled environment we maintain a highly integrated approach to our business by designing and manufacturing a significant portion of the components we view as critical to our products such as readwrite heads and recording media 

readwrite heads the function of the readwrite head is to scan across the disk as it spins magnetically recording or reading information the tolerances of readwrite heads are extremely demanding and require stateoftheart equipment and processes our readwrite heads are manufactured with thinfilm and photolithographic processes similar to those used to produce semiconductor integrated circuits though challenges related to magnetic film properties and topographical structures are unique to the disk drive industry we perform all primary stages of design and manufacture of readwrite heads at our facilities we use a combination of internally manufactured and externally sourced readwrite heads the mix of which varies based on product mix technology and our internal capacity levels 

media data is written to or read from the media or disk as it rotates at very high speeds past the readwrite head the media is made from nonmagnetic substrates usually an aluminum alloy or glass and is coated with thin layers of magnetic materials we use a combination of internally manufactured and externally sourced finished media and aluminum substrates the mix of which varies based on product mix technology and our internal capacity levels we purchase all of our glass substrates from third parties 

printed circuit board assemblies the printed circuit board assemblies “pcbas” are comprised of standard and custom asics and ancillary electronic control chips the asics control the movement of data to and from the readwrite heads and through the internal controller and interface which communicates with the host computer the asics and control chips form electronic circuitry that delivers instructions to a head positioning mechanism called an actuator to guide the heads to the selected track of a disk where the data is recorded or retrieved disk drive manufacturers use one or more industry standard interfaces such as sata scsi or sas to communicate to the host systems 

head disk assembly the head disk assembly consists of one or more disks attached to a spindle assembly powered by a spindle motor that rotates the disks at a high constant speed around a hub readwrite heads mounted on an arm assembly similar in concept to that of a record player fly extremely close to each disk surface and record data on and retrieve it from concentric tracks in the magnetic layers of the rotating disks the readwrite heads are mounted vertically on an eshaped assembly “eblock” that is actuated by a voicecoil motor to allow the heads to move from track to track the eblock and the recording media are mounted inside the head disk assembly we purchase spindle motors from outside vendors and from time to time participate in the design of the motors that go into our products 

disk drive assembly following the completion of the head disk assembly it is mated to the pcba and the completed unit goes through extensive defect mapping and machine learning prior to packaging and shipment disk drive assembly and machine learning operations occur primarily at our facilities located in china and thailand we perform subassembly and component manufacturing operations at our facilities in china malaysia northern ireland singapore thailand and the united states 

contract manufacturing we outsource the manufacturing and assembly of certain components and products to third parties in various countries worldwide this includes outsourcing the pcbas used in our disk drives ssds and storage subsystems we continue to participate in the design of our components and products and are directly involved in qualifying key suppliers and components used in our products 

suppliers of components and industry constraints there are a limited number of independent suppliers of components such as recording heads and media available to disk drive manufacturers vertically integrated disk drive manufacturers like us who manufacture their own components are less dependent on external component suppliers than less vertically integrated disk drive manufacturers however our business has been adversely affected by our suppliers’ capacity constraints in the past and this could occur in the future 

commodity and other manufacturing costs the production of disk drives requires rare earth elements precious metals scarce alloys and industrial commodities which are subject to fluctuations in price and the supply of which has at times been constrained in addition to increased costs of components and commodities volatility in fuel and other transportation costs may also increase our costs related to commodities manufacturing and freight as a result we may increase our use of alternative shipment methods to help offset any increase in freight costs and we will continually review various forms of shipments and routes in order to minimize the exposure to higher freight costs

our retail channel consists of our branded storage products sold to retailers either by us directly or by our distributors retail sales made by us or our distributors typically require greater marketing support sales incentives and price protection periods 

see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data— note 16 business segment and geographic information ” contained in this report for a description of our major customers 

competition 

we compete primarily with manufacturers of hard drives used in the mass capacity storage and legacy markets and with other companies in the data storage industry that provide ssds and eds some of the principal factors used by customers to differentiate among data storage solutions manufacturers are storage capacity product performance product quality and reliability price per unit and price per tb storageretrieval access times data transfer rates form factor product warranty and support capabilities supply continuity and flexibility power consumption total cost of ownership and brand while different markets and customers place varying levels of emphasis on these factors we believe that our products are competitive with respect to many of these factors in the markets that we currently compete in 

principal competitors we compete with manufacturers of storage solutions and the other principal manufacturers in the data storage solution industry include 

• micron technology inc 

• samsung electronics 

• sk hynix inc 

• kioxia holdings corporation 

• toshiba corporation and 

• western digital corporation operating the western digital hitachi global storage technologies and sandisk brands 

price erosion historically our industry has been characterized by price declines for data storage products with comparable capacity performance and feature sets “likeforlike products” price declines for likeforlike products “price erosion” tend to be more pronounced during periods of 

• economic contraction in which competitors may use discounted pricing to attempt to maintain or gain market share 

• few new product introductions when competitors have comparable or alternative product offerings and 

• industry supply exceeding demand 

data storage manufacturers typically attempt to offset price erosion with an improved mix of data storage products characterized by higher capacity better performance and additional feature sets and product cost reductions 

we believe the hdd industry experienced modest price erosion in fiscal years 2020 2019 and 2018 

product life cycles and changing technology success in our industry has been dependent to a large extent on the ability to balance the introduction and transition of new products with timetovolume performance capacity and quality metrics at a competitive price level of service and support that our customers expect generally the drive manufacturer that introduces a new product first benefits from improved product mix favorable profit margins and less pricing pressure until comparable products are introduced changing technology also necessitates ongoing investments in research and development which may be difficult to recover due to rapid product life cycles and economic declines further there is a continued need to successfully execute product transitions and new product introductions as factors such as quality reliability and manufacturing yields continue to be of significant competitive importance 

s 

seasonality 

variability of sales can be related to the timing of it spending or a reflection of cyclical demand from csps based on the timing of their procurement and deployment requirements and the supply and demand balance of other components such as nand and dram our legacy markets traditionally experience seasonal variability in demand with higher levels of demand in the second half of the calendar year this seasonality is driven by consumer spending in the backtoschool season from late summer to fall and the traditional holiday shopping season from fall to winter 

research and development 

we are committed to developing new component technologies products and alternative storage technologies our research and development focus is designed to bring new products to market in high volume with quality attributes that our customers expect before our competitors part of our product development strategy is to leverage a design platform andor subsystem within product families to serve different market needs this platform strategy allows for more efficient resource utilization leverages best design practices reduces exposure to changes in demand and allows for achievement of lower costs through purchasing economies our advanced technology integration effort focuses disk drive and component research on recording subsystems including readwrite heads and recording media marketspecific product technology and technology we believe may lead to new business opportunities the primary purpose of our advanced technology integration effort is to ensure timely availability of mature component technologies for our product development teams as well as to allow us to leverage and coordinate those technologies in the design centers across our products in order to take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace 

patents and licenses 

as of july 3 2020 we had approximately 5300 us patents and 1200 patents issued in various foreign jurisdictions as well as approximately 700 us and 400 foreign patent applications pending the number of patents and patent applications will vary at any given time as part of our ongoing patent portfolio management activity due to the rapid technological change that characterizes the data storage industry we believe that in addition to patent protection the improvement of existing products reliance upon trade secrets protection of unpatented proprietary knowhow and development of new products are also important to our business in establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage accordingly we intend to continue our efforts to broadly protect our intellectual property including obtaining patents where available in connection with our research and development program 

the data storage industry is characterized by significant litigation arising from time to time relating to patent and other intellectual property rights from time to time we receive claims that our products infringe patents of third parties although we have been able to resolve some of those claims or potential claims without a material adverse effect on us other claims have resulted in adverse decisions or settlements in addition other claims are pending which if resolved unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations for more information on these claims see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data— note 14 legal environmental and other contingencies ” the costs of engaging in intellectual property litigation in the past have been and in the future may be substantial irrespective of the merits of the claim or the outcome 

backlog 

in view of industry practice whereby customers may cancel or defer orders with little or no penalty we believe backlog for our business is of limited indicative value in estimating future performance and results 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we operate relating to the protection of the environment including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites some of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution and these permits are subject to modification renewal and revocation by issuing authorities 

s 

we have established environmental management systems and continually update environmental policies and standard operating procedures for our operations worldwide we believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws regulations and permits we budget for operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental laws if additional or more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future we could incur additional operating costs and capital expenditures 

some environmental laws such as the us comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended the “superfund” law and its state equivalents can impose liability for the cost of cleanup of contaminated sites upon any of the current or former site owners or operators or upon parties who sent waste to these sites regardless of whether the owner or operator owned the site at the time of the release of hazardous substances or the lawfulness of the original disposal activity we have been identified as a responsible or potentially responsible party at several sites based on current estimates of cleanup costs and our expected allocation of these costs we do not expect costs in connection with these sites to be material 

we may be subject to various state federal and international laws and regulations governing environmental matters including those restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products for example the european union “eu” enacted the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment 201165eu which prohibits the use of certain substances including lead in certain products including disk drives and server storage products put on the market after july 1 2006 similar legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions including in the us canada mexico taiwan china and japan the eu reach directive registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals ec 19072006 also restricts substances of very high concern in products if we or our suppliers fail to comply with the substance restrictions recycle requirements or other environmental requirements as they are enacted worldwide it could have a materially adverse effect on our business 

employees 

at july 3 2020 we employed approximately 42000 employees and temporary employees worldwide of which approximately 35000 were located in our asia operations we believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees at all levels we believe that our employee relations are good

 item 1a risk factors 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic has impacted our business operating results and financial condition  as well as the operations and financial performance of many of the customers and suppliers in industries that we serve we are unable to predict the extent to which the pandemic and related effects will adversely impact our business operations financial performance results of operations financial position and the achievement of our strategic objectives  

the covid19 pandemic has resulted in a widespread health crisis and numerous disease control measures being taken to limit its spread the impact of the pandemic on our business has included or could in the future include 

• disruptions to or restrictions on our ability to ensure the continuous manufacture and supply of our products and services including insufficiency of our existing inventory levels 

• temporary closures or reductions in operational capacity of our facilities or the facilities of our direct or indirect suppliers or customers 

• permanent closures of our direct and indirect suppliers resulting in adverse effects to our supply chain 

• temporary shortages of skilled employees available to staff manufacturing facilities due to stay at home orders and travel restrictions within as well as into and out of countries 

• increases in operational expenses and other costs related to requirements implemented to mitigate the impact of the pandemic 

• supply chain disruptions 

• delays or limitations on the ability of our customers to perform or make timely payments 

• reductions in short and longterm demand for our products or other disruptions in technology buying patterns 

• adverse effects on economies and financial markets globally or in various markets throughout the world potentially leading to a prolonged economic downturn or reductions in business and consumer spending which may result in decreased net revenue gross margins or earnings andor in increased expenses and difficulty in managing inventory levels 

• delays to andor lengthening of our sales or development cycles or qualification activity 

• challenges for us our direct and indirect suppliers and our customers in obtaining financing due to turmoil in financial markets 

• workforce disruptions due to illness quarantines governmental actions other restrictions andor the social distancing measures we have taken to mitigate the impact of covid19 at certain of our locations around the world in an effort to protect the health and wellbeing of our employees customers suppliers and of the communities in which we operate including working from home restricting the number of employees attending events or meetings in person limiting the number of people in our buildings and factories at any one time further restricting access to our facilities suspending employee travel and inability to meet in person with customers 

• increased vulnerability to cyberattacks due to the significant number of employees working remotely and 

• our management team continuing to commit significant time attention and resources to monitoring the covid19 pandemic and seeking to mitigate its effects on our business and workforce 

the ultimate extent of the impact of covid19 on our business financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time these impacts individually or in the aggregate could have a material and adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition such effect may be exacerbated in the event the pandemic and the measures taken in response to it and their effects persist for an extended period of time or if there is a resurgence of the outbreak under any of these circumstances the resumption of normal business operations may be delayed or hampered by lingering effects of covid19 on our operations direct and indirect suppliers partners and customers 

we operate in highly competitive markets and our failure to anticipate and respond to technological changes and other market developments including price could harm our ability to compete 

we face intense competition in the data storage industry our principal sources of competition include  

• disk drive and ssd manufacturers such as micron technology inc samsung electronics sk hynix inc toshiba corporation kioxia holdings corporation and western digital corporation and 

• companies that provide storage subsystems and components to oems including electronic manufacturing services “ems” and contract electronic manufacturing “cem” 

s 

the markets for our data storage products are characterized by technological change which is driven in part by the adoption of new industry standards these standards provide mechanisms to ensure technology component interoperability but they also hinder our ability to innovate or differentiate our products when this occurs our products may be deemed commodities which could result in downward pressure on prices 

we also experience competition from other companies that produce alternative storage technologies such as flash memory where increasing capacity decreasing cost energy efficiency and improvements in performance have resulted in increased competition with our lower capacity smaller form factor disk drives some customers for both mass capacity storage and legacy markets have adopted ssds as an alternative to hard drives in certain applications further adoption of alternative storage technologies may limit our total addressable hdd market impact the competitiveness of our product portfolio and reduce our market share any resulting increase in competition could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations  

in addition the barriers to entry into our markets could be lowered allowing large ems and cem companies that utilize generalpurpose design skills to enter our markets and reduce the value of our specialized research and design skills if our markets become more commoditized and we fail to deliver innovative alternative products to our customers or match the price declines or cost efficiencies we will have difficulty competing against the large ems and cem companies this could result in lower profit margins or a loss of market share any significant decline in our market share in any of our principal markets would adversely affect our results of operations 

we must plan our investments in our products and incur costs before we have customer orders or know about the market conditions at the time the products are produced if we fail to predict demand accurately for our products or if the markets for our products change we may be unable to meet demand or we may have insufficient demand which may materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our industry operates primarily on quarterly purchasing cycles with most of the orders typically coming at the end of each quarter our manufacturing process requires us to make significant productspecific investments in inventory each quarter for production in that quarter or a specific quarter in the future as a result we incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales that may never materialize or that may be substantially lower than expected if actual demand for our products is lower than the forecast we may also experience higher inventory carrying costs manufacturing rework costs and product obsolescence conversely if we underestimate demand we may have insufficient inventory to satisfy demand and may have to forego sales  

other factors that have affected and may continue to affect our ability to anticipate or meet the demand for our products and adversely affect our results of operations include 

• competitive product announcements or technological advances that result in excess supply when customers cancel purchases in anticipation of newer products 

• variable demand resulting from unanticipated upward or downward pricing pressures 

• our ability to successfully qualify manufacture and sell our data storage products 

• changes in our product mix which may adversely affect our gross margins 

• manufacturing delays or interruptions particularly at our manufacturing facilities in china malaysia northern ireland singapore thailand or the united states 

• limited access to components that we obtain from a single or a limited number of suppliers and 

• the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the cost of producing our products and the effective price of our products to nonus customers 

in addition we derive a portion of our revenues in each quarter from a small number of relatively large orders if one or more of our key customers decides to defer or cancel a purchase order or delay product acceptance in any given quarter our revenues for that quarter may be significantly reduced and fall below our expectations conversely if one of our key customers unexpectedly increases its orders we may be unable to produce the additional product volumes in a timely manner or take advantage of any overall increased market demand this could damage our customer relationships and reputation which may adversely affect our results of operations  

s 

changes in demand for computer systems data storage subsystems and consumer electronic devices may in the future cause a decline in demand for our products 

our products are components in computers data storage systems and consumer electronic devices historically the demand for these products has been volatile unexpected slowdowns in demand for computers data storage subsystems or consumer electronic devices generally result in sharp declines in demand for our products declines in customer spending on the systems and devices that incorporate our products could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and on our financial condition and results of operations uncertain global economic and business conditions can exacerbate these risks 

sales to the legacy markets remain an important part of our business these markets however have been and we expect them to continue to be adversely affected by 

• announcements or introductions of major new operating systems or semiconductor improvements or shifts in customer preferences performance requirements and behavior such as the shift to tablet computers smart phones nand flash memory or similar devices 

• longer product life cycles and 

• changes in macroeconomic conditions that cause customers to spend less such as the imposition of new tariffs increased laws and regulations and increased unemployment levels 

we believe these announcements and introductions from time to time have caused customers to defer or cancel their purchases making certain inventory obsolete whenever an oversupply of products in the market causes participants in our industry to have higher than anticipated inventory levels we experience even more intense price competition from other manufacturers than usual which may materially adversely affect our financial results we believe that the deterioration of demand for disk drives in certain of the legacy markets has accelerated and this deterioration may continue or further accelerate which could cause our operating results to suffer 

in addition the demand for legacy markets products is volatile this volatility may be exacerbated by competing alternative storage technologies such as flash memory which meet customers’ cost and capacity metrics unpredictable fluctuations in demand for our products or rapid shifts in demand from our products to alternative storage technologies could materially adversely impact our future results of operations 

we are dependent on our longterm investments to manufacture adequate products our investment decisions in adding new assembly and test capacity require significant planning and leadtime and a failure to accurately forecast demand for our products could cause us to overinvest or underinvest which would lead to excess capacity underutilization charges impairments or loss of sales and revenue opportunities 

our ability to increase our revenue and maintain our market share depends on our ability to successfully introduce and achieve market acceptance of new products on a timely basis  

the markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product introductions and technology enhancements uncertain product life cycles and changes in customer demand 

historically our results of operations have substantially depended upon our ability to be among the firsttomarket with new data storage product offerings we may face technological operational and financial challenges in developing new products in addition our investments in new product development may not yield the anticipated benefits our market share revenue and results of operations in the future may be adversely affected if we fail to  

• consistently maintain our timetomarket performance with our new products 

• produce these products in adequate volume 

• qualify these products with key customers on a timely basis by meeting our customers’ performance and quality specifications or 

• achieve acceptable manufacturing yields quality and costs with these products 

accordingly we cannot accurately determine the ultimate effect that our new products will have on our results of operations our failure to accurately anticipate customers’ needs and accurately identify the shift in technological changes could materially adversely affect our longterm financial results 

in addition the limited number of highvolume oems magnifies the potential effect of missing a product qualification opportunity if the delivery of our products is delayed our oem customers may use our competitors’ products to meet their production requirements 

s 

we cannot assure you that we will be among the leaders in timetomarket with new products or that we will be able to successfully qualify new products with our customers in the future  if our new products are not successful our future results of operations may be adversely affected 

if our products do not keep pace with technological changes our results of operations will be adversely affected  

our customers demand new generations of storage products as advances in computer hardware and software have created the need for improved storage products with features such as increased storage capacity enhanced security improved performance and reliability and lower cost we and our competitors have developed improved products and we will need to continue to do so in the future if we are unable to develop new products identify business strategies and timely introduce competitive product offerings to meet technological shifts or we are unable to execute successfully our business and results of operations may be adversely affected  

when we develop new products with higher capacity and more advanced technology our results of operations may decline because the increased difficulty and complexity associated with producing these products increases the likelihood of reliability quality or operability problems if our products experience increases in failure rates are of low quality or are not reliable customers may reduce their purchases of our products our factory utilization may decrease and our manufacturing rework and scrap costs and our service and warranty costs may increase in addition a decline in the reliability of our products may make it more difficult for us to effectively compete with our competitors 

additionally we may be unable to produce new products that have higher capacities and more advanced technologies in the volumes and timeframes that are required to meet customer demand we are transitioning to key areal density recording technologies that use hamr technology to increase hdd capacities if our transitions to more advanced technologies including the transition to hdds utilizing hamr technology require development and production cycles that are longer than anticipated or if we otherwise fail to implement new hdd technologies successfully we may lose sales and market share which could significantly harm our financial results  

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations and our investments to meet our liquidity requirements including servicing our indebtedness  

our business may not generate sufficient cash flows to enable us to meet our liquidity requirements including working capital capital expenditures product development efforts investments servicing our indebtedness and other general corporate requirements if we cannot fund our liquidity requirements we may have to reduce or delay capital expenditures product development efforts investments and other general corporate expenditures we cannot assure you that any of these remedies would if necessary be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all or that they would permit us to meet our obligations which would affect our results of operations 

we are leveraged and require significant amounts of cash to service our debt our debt and debt service requirements could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities and reduce our options for capital allocation our high level of debt presents the following risks 

• we are required to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements 

• our substantial leverage increases our vulnerability to economic downturns decreased availability of capital and adverse competitive and industry conditions and could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that are less leveraged 

• our debt service obligations could limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry and could limit our ability to pursue other business opportunities borrow more money for operations or capital in the future and implement our business strategies 

• our level of debt may restrict us from raising or make it more costly to raise additional financing on satisfactory terms to fund working capital capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements and 

• covenants in our debt instruments limit our ability to pay future dividends or make other restricted payments and investments 

s 

in addition in the event that we need to refinance all or a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures or incur additional debt to fund our operations we may not be able to obtain terms as favorable as the terms of our existing debt or refinance our existing debt at all if prevailing interest rates or other factors result in higher interest rates upon refinancing then the interest expense relating to the refinanced debt would increase furthermore if any rating agency changes our credit rating or outlook our debt and equity securities could be negatively affected which could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt or raise additional capital  

we may not be successful in our efforts to grow our eds and ssd revenues 

we have made and continue to make investments to grow our eds and ssd revenues our ability to grow eds and ssd revenues is subject to the following risks 

• we may be unable to accurately estimate and predict data center capacity and requirements 

• we may not be able to offer compelling solutions to enterprises and consumers 

• we may be unable to obtain cost effective supply of nand flash memory in order to offer competitive ssd solutions and 

• our cloud systems revenues generally have a longer sales cycle and growth is likely to depend on relatively large customer orders which may increase the variability of our results of operations and the difficulty of matching revenues with expenses 

our results of operations and share price may be adversely affected if we are not successful in our efforts to grow our revenues as anticipated in addition our growth in these markets may bring us into closer competition with some of our customers or potential customers which may decrease their willingness to do business with us 

changes in the macroeconomic environment may in the future negatively impact our results of operations 

changes in macroeconomic conditions may affect consumer and enterprise spending and as a result our customers may postpone or cancel spending in response to volatility in credit and equity markets negative financial news andor declines in income or asset values all of which may have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products andor result in significant decreases in our product prices other factors that could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and on our financial condition and results of operations include conditions in the labor market healthcare costs access to credit consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer and business spending behavior 

macroeconomic developments such as the withdrawal of the united kingdom “uk” from the european union “eu” slowing economies in parts of asia and the americas increased tariffs between the us and china mexico and other countries or adverse economic conditions worldwide resulting from the covid19 pandemic and efforts of governments and private industry to slow the pandemic through stay at home orders social distancing requirements and other disease control measures could negatively affect our business operating results or financial condition which in turn could adversely affect the price of our ordinary shares a general weakening of and related declining corporate confidence in the global economy or the curtailment in government or corporate spending could cause current or potential customers to reduce their information technology “it” budgets or be unable to fund data storage systems which could cause customers to delay decrease or cancel purchases of our products or cause customers not to pay us or to delay paying us for previously purchased products and services  

s 

our quarterly results of operations fluctuate sometimes significantly from period to period and may cause our share price to decline  

our quarterly revenue and results of operations fluctuate sometimes significantly from period to period these fluctuations which we expect to continue have been and may continue to be precipitated by a variety of factors including 

• uncertainty in global economic and political conditions which may pose a risk to the overall economy or specific geographies or industries and adversely affect our customers’ purchasing behavior 

• adverse changes in the level of economic activity in the major regions in which we do business 

• competitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices by our competitors which may shift demand away from our products toward those of our competitors 

• delays or problems in our introduction of new more costeffective products the inability to achieve high production yields or delays in customer qualification or initial product quality issues 

• changes in purchasing patterns of our customers 

• application of new or revised industry standards 

• disruptions in our supply chain 

• increased costs or adverse changes in availability of supplies of raw materials or components 

• the impact of corporate restructuring activities that we have and may continue to engage in 

• changes in the demand for the computer systems and data storage products that contain our products due to seasonality economic conditions and other factors 

• shifting trends in customer demand which when combined with overproduction of particular products particularly when the industry is served by multiple suppliers results in unfavorable supply and demand imbalances 

• our high proportion of fixed costs including research and development expenses 

• any impairments in goodwill or other longlived assets 

• announcements of new products services or technological innovations by us or our competitors 

• changes in tax laws regulatory requirements including export regulations or tariffs or accounting standards and 

• adverse changes in the performance of our products 

as a result we believe that quartertoquarter and yearoveryear comparisons of our revenue and results of operations may not be meaningful and that these comparisons may not be an accurate indicator of our future performance our results of operations in one or more future quarters may fail to meet the expectations of investment research analysts or investors which could cause an immediate and significant decline in our market value 

s 

we experience seasonal declines in the sales of our products during the second half of our fiscal year which may adversely affect our results of operations 

sales of computers storage subsystems and consumer electronic devices tend to be seasonal and therefore we expect to continue to experience seasonality in our business as we respond to variations in our customers’ demand for our products in particular we anticipate that sales of our products will continue to be lower during the second half of our fiscal year in the desktop and notebook consumer and gaming storage legacy markets applications of our data storage business this seasonality is partially attributable to the historical trend of our customers’ increased sales of desktop computers notebook computers and consumer electronics during the backtoschool and winter holiday season in the desktop and notebook consumer and gaming storage legacy markets our sales are seasonal because of the purchasing cycles of our end users we also experience seasonal reductions in the business activities of our customers during international holidays like lunar new year as well as in the summer months particularly in europe which typically result in lower sales during those periods since our working capital needs peak during periods in which we are increasing production in anticipation of orders that have not yet been received our results of operations will fluctuate seasonally even if the forecasted demand for our products proves accurate furthermore it is difficult for us to evaluate the degree to which this seasonality may affect our business in future periods because of the rate and unpredictability of product transitions and new product introductions as well as macroeconomic conditions 

we have a long and unpredictable sales cycle for nearline and mission critical storage solutions which impairs our ability to accurately predict our financial and operating results in any period and may adversely affect our ability to forecast the need for investments and expenditures  

our nearline and mission critical storage solutions are technically complex and we typically supply them in high quantities to a small number of customers many of our products are also tailored to meet the specific requirements of individual customers and are often integrated by our customers into the systems and products that they sell factors that affect the length of our sales cycle include 

• the time required for developing testing and evaluating our products before they are deployed 

• the size of the deployment and 

• the complexity of system configuration necessary to deploy our products 

as a result our sales cycle for nearline and mission critical storage solutions is often in excess of one year and frequently unpredictable given the length of development and qualification programs and unpredictability of the sales cycle we may be unable to accurately forecast product demand which may result in lost sales or excess inventory and associated inventory reserves or writedowns each of which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations  

we may be adversely affected by the loss of or reduced delayed or canceled purchases by one or more of our key customers  

some of our key customers account for a large portion of our revenue while we have longstanding relationships with many of our customers if any of our key customers were to significantly reduce their purchases from us or we were prohibited or restricted by law regulation or other governmental action from selling to those key customers our results of operations would be adversely affected although sales to key customers may vary from period to period a key customer that permanently discontinues or significantly reduces its relationship with us could be difficult to replace in line with industry practice new key customers usually require that we pass a lengthy and rigorous qualification process at the customer’s expense accordingly it may be difficult or costly for us to attract new key customers  

additionally if there is consolidation among our customer base our customers may be able to command increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale which could adversely affect our profitability furthermore if as a result of increased leverage customer pressures require us to reduce our pricing such that our gross margins are diminished it might not be feasible to sell our products to a particular customer which could result in a decrease in our revenue consolidation among our customer base may also lead to reduced demand for our products replacement of our products by the combined entity with those of our competitors and cancellations of orders each of which could adversely affect our results of operations if a significant transaction or regulatory impact involving any of our key customers results in the loss of or reduction in purchases by these key customers it could have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition  

s 

we are dependent on sales to distributors and retailers which may increase price erosion and the volatility of our sales  

a substantial portion of our sales has been to distributors of disk drive products certain of our distributors may also market other products that compete with our products product qualification programs in this distribution channel are limited which increases the number of competing products that are available to satisfy demand particularly in times of lengthening product cycles as a result purchasing decisions in this channel are based largely on price terms and product availability sales volumes through this channel are also less predictable and subject to greater volatility than sales to our oem customers in addition deterioration in business and economic conditions could exacerbate price erosion and volatility as distributors lower prices to compensate for lower demand and higher inventory levels our distributors’ ability to access credit for purposes of funding their operations may also affect purchases of our products by these customers if distributors reduce their purchases of our products or prices decline significantly in this distribution channel or if distributors experience financial difficulties or terminate their relationships with us our revenues and results of operations would be adversely affected 

in addition retail sales of our legacy markets solutions traditionally experience seasonal variability in demand with higher levels of demand in the first half of our fiscal year driven by consumer spending in the backtoschool season from late summer to fall and the traditional holiday shopping season from fall to winter our ability to reach such consumers depends on us maintaining effective working relationships with major retailers and distributors failure to anticipate consumer demand for our branded solutions as well as an inability to maintain effective working relationships with retail and online distributors may adversely impact our future results of operations  

our worldwide sales and manufacturing operations subject us to risks that may adversely affect our business related to disruptions in international markets currency exchange fluctuations longer payment cycles potential adverse tax consequences increased costs our customers’ credit and access to capital healthrelated risks including pandemics such as covid19 investment risks tariffs privacy and protection of data and access to personnel  

we have significant sales and manufacturing operations outside of the united states including manufacturing facilities sales personnel and customer support operations we have manufacturing facilities in china malaysia northern ireland singapore thailand and the united states additionally the manufacturing of some of our products is concentrated in certain geographical locations the production of certain drive subassemblies are limited to thailand and the production of media is limited to singapore we also generate a significant portion of our revenue from sales outside the united states disruptions in the economic environmental political legal or regulatory landscape in these countries may have a material adverse impact on our manufacturing and sales operations 

our worldwide operations are subject to economic regulatory and other risks inherent in doing business internationally including the following  

• disruptions in international markets disruptions in financial markets and the deterioration of the underlying economic conditions in the past in some countries including the united kingdom and those in asia and the european union have had an impact on our sales to customers located in or whose enduser customers are located in these countries 

• fluctuations in currency exchange rates prices for our products are denominated predominantly in dollars even when sold to customers that are located outside the us an increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside of the us where we sell in dollars this could adversely impact our sales and market share in such areas or increase pressure on us to lower our price and adversely impact our profit margins in addition we have revenue and expenses denominated in currencies other than the dollar primarily the thai baht singaporean dollar chinese renminbi and british pound sterling which further exposes us to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates a weakened dollar could increase the effective cost of our expenses such as payroll utilities tax and marketing expenses as well as overseas capital expenditures any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations we have attempted to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes by among other things entering into foreign currency forward exchange contracts from time to time which could be designated as cash flow hedges or not designated as hedging instruments our hedging strategy may be ineffective and specific hedges may expire and not be renewed or may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations the hedging activities may not cover our full exposure subject us to certain counterparty credit risks and may impact our results of operations see “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk— foreign currency exchange risk ” of this report for additional information about our foreign currency exchange risk 

• longer payment cycles our customers outside of the united states are sometimes allowed longer time periods for payment than our us customers this increases the risk of nonpayment due to the possibility that the financial condition of particular customers may worsen during the course of the payment period 

s 

• potential adverse tax consequences we are incorporated in ireland and have offices operations and subsidiaries in many countries around the world our international operations create a risk of potential adverse tax consequences including imposition of withholding or other taxes on payments by our subsidiaries in addition our taxable income in any jurisdiction is dependent upon acceptance of our operational practices and intercompany transfer pricing by local tax authorities as being on an arm’s length basis due to inconsistencies in application of the arm’s length standard among taxing authorities as well as a lack of adequate treatybased protection transfer pricing challenges by tax authorities could if successful substantially increase our income tax expense we are subject to tax audits around the world and are under audit in various jurisdictions and such jurisdictions have in the past assessed and may in the future assess additional income tax against us although we believe our tax positions are reasonable the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from our recorded income tax provisions and accruals the ultimate results of an audit could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made and could result in increases to our overall tax expense in subsequent periods in light of the ongoing fiscal challenges many countries are facing various levels of government are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative or regulatory action to increase tax revenue in addition the organization for economic cooperation and developments base erosion and profit shifting recommendations are reshaping international tax rules in numerous countries these actual and potential changes in the relevant tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals along with potential changes in accounting and other laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations could increase the risk of double taxation cause increased tax audit activity and could impact our effective tax rate 

• increased costs the shipping and transportation costs associated with our international operations are typically higher than those associated with our us operations resulting in decreased operating margins in some countries volatility in fuel costs political instability or constraints in or increases in the costs of air transportation may lead us to develop alternative shipment methods which could disrupt our ability to receive raw materials or ship finished product and as a result our business and results of operations may be harmed 

• credit and access to capital risks our customers could have reduced access to working capital due to global economic conditions higher interest rates reduced bank lending resulting from contractions in the money supply or the deterioration in the customer’s or their bank’s financial condition or the inability to access other financing which would increase our credit and nonpayment risk and could result in an increase in our operating costs or a reduction in our revenue in addition some of our oem customers have adopted a subcontractor model that requires us to contract directly with companies such as original design manufacturers that provide manufacturing and fulfillment services to our oem customers because these subcontractors are generally not as well capitalized as our direct oem customers this subcontractor model exposes us to increased credit risks our agreements with our oem customers may not permit us to increase our product prices to alleviate this increased credit risk 

• global health outbreaks the occurrence of a pandemic disease such as the recent covid19 pandemic has impacted and may adversely impact our operations including without limitation logistical and other operational costs and the operations of some of our key direct and indirect suppliers and customers the reactions by governments and private industry to such diseases have also disrupted and could continue to disrupt the availability timeliness and reliability of the supply chains and distribution networks we rely on 

s 

• privacy and protection of data  our business is subject to a number of laws rules and regulations in the countries where we operate pertaining to the collection processing security use retention and transfer of information about our customers consumers and employees for example the general data protection regulation “gdpr” which is in effect in the european economic area “eea” applies to our operations the gdpr imposes stringent data protection requirements in the eea and provides for greater penalties for noncompliance of up to the greater of 4 of worldwide annual revenue or €20 million in china we are monitoring legal and government advisory developments regarding the chinese cybersecurity law and draft cybersecurity review measures for impacts to our business related to crossborder transfer limitations and evolving privacy security or data protection requirements in the us numerous federal and state laws rules and regulations apply to our data handling practices for example california recently enacted legislation the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” which among other things requires new disclosures to california consumers and affords such consumers new abilities to

new privacy law the california privacy rights act “cpra” recently was certified by the california secretary of state to appear on the ballot for the november 3 2020 election if this initiative is approved by california voters the cpra would significantly modify the ccpa potentially resulting in further uncertainty and requiring us to incur additional costs and expenses the us federal government and other states in the us also have proposed or enacted similar laws and regulations relating to privacy and data protection some countries have passed or are considering legislation limiting extraterritorial transfers of data including requiring the local storage and processing of data or similar requirements as a result of the july 16 2020 european court of justice “ecj” opinion

we are subject to counterparty default risks 

we have numerous arrangements with financial institutions that subject us to counterparty default risks including cash and investment deposits and foreign currency forward exchange contracts and other derivative instruments as a result we are subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these arrangements will voluntarily or involuntarily default on its performance obligations in times of market distress in particular a counterparty may not comply with its contractual commitments that could then lead to it defaulting on its obligations with little or no notice to us thereby limiting our ability to take action to lessen or cover our exposure additionally our ability to mitigate our counterparty exposures could be limited by the terms of the relevant agreements or because market conditions prevent us from taking effective action if one of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy our ability to recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterpartys default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty or the applicable laws governing the bankruptcy proceedings in the event of any such counterparty default we could incur significant losses which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our business is subject to various laws regulations and governmental policies that may cause us to incur significant expense  

our business is subject to regulation under a wide variety of us federal and state and nonus laws regulations and policies there can be no assurance that laws regulations and policies will not be changed in ways that will require us to modify our business model and objectives or affect our returns on investments by restricting existing activities and products subjecting them to escalating costs or prohibiting them outright in particular legislative regulatory or other areas of significance for our businesses that us and nonus governments have focused and continue to focus on including antitrust and competition law improper payments data privacy and sovereignty currency exchange controls that could restrict the movement of liquidity from particular jurisdictions trade controls or tariffs on imports and exports in the us or other countries complex economic sanctions and the enactment of us tax reform and potential further changes to global tax laws have had and may continue to have an effect on our corporate structure operations sales liquidity capital requirements effective tax rate and financial performance china malaysia northern ireland singapore and thailand in which we have significant operating assets and the european union each have exercised and continue to exercise significant influence over many aspects of their domestic economies including but not limited to fair competition tax practices anticorruption antitrust price controls and international trade 

in addition regulation or government scrutiny may impact the requirements for marketing our products and slow our ability to introduce new products resulting in an adverse impact on our business although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate these or other applicable laws rules and regulations to which we are and may be subject violations of these laws and regulations could lead to significant penalties restraints on our export or import privileges monetary fines government investigations disruption of our operating activities damage to our reputation and corporate brand criminal proceedings and regulatory or other actions that could materially adversely affect our results of operations the political and media scrutiny surrounding a governmental investigation for the violation of such laws even if an investigation does not result in a finding of violation could cause us significant expense and collateral consequences including reputational harm that could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

changes in us trade policy including the imposition of sanctions or tariffs and the resulting consequences may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

the us government has adopted a new approach to trade policy including in some cases to renegotiate or potentially terminate certain existing bilateral or multilateral trade agreements the us government has also imposed tariffs on certain nonus goods including information and communication technology products these measures may materially increase costs for goods imported into the united states this in turn could require us to materially increase prices to our customers which may reduce demand or if we are unable to increase prices to adequately address any tariffs quotas or duties result in lowering our margin on products sold changes in us trade policy have resulted in and could result in more us trading partners adopting responsive trade policies including imposition of increased tariffs quotas or duties making it more difficult or costly for us to export our products to those countries the implementation of a border tax tariff or higher customs duties on our products manufactured abroad or components that we import into the us or any potential corresponding actions by other countries in which we do business could negatively impact our financial performance the us government also imposes sanctions through executive orders restricting us companies from conducting business activities with specified individuals and companies and the sanctions imposed by the us government could be expanded in the future if we are unable to conduct business with new or existing customers our business including revenue profitability and cash flows could be materially adversely affected

our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer equipment and the electronic data stored in our databases we manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our operations as our operations become more automated and increasingly interdependent our exposure to the risks posed by storage and maintenance of data will continue to increase the measures we have implemented to secure our computer equipment and electronic data have been and may continue to be vulnerable to phishing employee error hacking malfeasance system error or other irregularities and may not be sufficient for all eventualities including sustained maintenance of remote working requirements the insurance coverage we maintain that is intended to address certain data security risks may be insufficient to cover all types of claims or losses that may arise we have been and will likely continue to be subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes cyberattacks or other computerrelated attempts to breach the it systems we use for these purposes we have been and may also continue be subject to it system failures and network disruptions due to these factors experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of thirdparties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products such attempts are increasing in technical sophistication number and the ability to evade detection or to obscure such activities although we take steps to protect against and detect such attempts our efforts may not be sufficient for all eventualities including sustained maintenance of remote working requirements in addition sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from thirdparties may contain defects in design or manufacture including “bugs” and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system  

the costs to us to eliminate or address the foregoing security problems and security vulnerabilities before or after a cyberincident could be significant system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions we could lose existing or potential customers for outsourcing services or other it solutions in connection with any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products some of our products contain encryption and other measures to protect thirdparty content stored on our products such measures may be compromised breached or circumvented by sophisticated attackers and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information may occur breaches of our security measures and the unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers or other thirdparties has exposed us and could expose us our vendors and customers or other thirdparties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation or governmental investigations and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business failure to meet our contractual obligations to promote information security with certain customers may result in liability including additional costs indemnification claims litigation and damage to our brand and reputation in addition we rely in certain limited capacities on thirdparty data management providers whose possible security problems and security vulnerabilities may have similar effects on us our business brand and reputation could also be adversely affected by media or other reports of perceived security vulnerabilities in our products network or processes even if unsubstantiated  

we are subject to laws rules and regulations in the us uk eu and other countries relating to the collection use and security of user data in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries and among us our subsidiaries and other parties with which we have commercial relations our ability to execute transactions and to possess and use personal information and data in conducting our business subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens that require us to notify vendors customers or employees of a data security breach we have incurred and will continue to incur significant expenses to comply with mandatory privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law regulation industry standards and contractual obligations these laws protocols and standards continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction complying with emerging and changing international requirements has caused and may continue to cause us to incur substantial costs or required or may continue to require us to change our business practices if we fail to comply with applicable federal state or international privacyrelated or data protection laws we may be subject to proceedings by governmental entities and incur penalties significant legal liability or reputational harm

we must successfully maintain and upgrade our it systems and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations  

from time to time we expand and improve our it systems to support our business going forward consequently we are in the process of implementing and will continue to invest in and implement modifications and upgrades to our it systems and procedures including making changes to legacy systems or acquiring new systems with new functionality and building new policies procedures training programs and monitoring tools including in connection with the sustained maintenance of remote working requirements these types of activities subject us to inherent costs and risks associated with changing and acquiring these systems policies procedures and monitoring tools including capital expenditures additional operating expenses demands on management time and other risks and costs of delays or difficulties in transitioning to or integrating new systems policies procedures or monitoring tools into our current systems these implementations modifications and upgrades may not result in productivity improvements at a level that outweighs the costs of implementation or at all in addition difficulties with implementing new technology systems delays in our timeline for planned improvements significant system failures or our inability to successfully modify our it systems policies procedures or monitoring tools to respond to changes in our business needs have caused and may continue to cause disruptions in our business operations and may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we experience shortages or delays in the receipt of or cost increases in critical components equipment or raw materials necessary to manufacture our products we may suffer lower operating margins production delays and other material adverse effects 

the cost quality availability and supply of components subassemblies certain equipment and raw materials used to manufacture our products and key components like recording media and heads are critical to our success particularly important for our products are components such as readwrite heads substrates for recording media asics spindle motors printed circuit boards suspension assemblies and nand flash memory in addition the equipment we use to manufacture our products and components is frequently custom made and comes from a few suppliers and the lead times required to obtain manufacturing equipment can be significant 

we rely on sole direct and indirect suppliers or a limited number of direct and indirect suppliers for some or all of these components that we do not manufacture including substrates for recording media readwrite heads asics spindle motors printed circuit boards suspension assemblies and nand flash memory many of such direct and indirect component suppliers are geographically concentrated making our supply chain more vulnerable to regional disruptions such as severe weather the occurrence of local or global health issues or pandemics such as covid19 acts of terrorism and an unpredictable geopolitical climate which may have a material impact on the production availability and transportation of many components for example we have experienced and continue to experience disruptions in our supply chain due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic if our direct and indirect vendors for these components are unable to meet our cost quality supply and transportation requirements continue to remain financially viable or fulfill their contractual commitments and obligations we could experience disruption in our supply chain including shortages in supply or increases in production costs which would materially adversely affect our results of operations 

certain rare earth elements are critical in the manufacture of our products we purchase components that contain rare earth elements from a number of countries including china we cannot predict whether any nation will impose regulations or trade barriers including tariffs duties quotas or embargoes upon the rare earth elements incorporated into our products that would restrict the worldwide supply of such metals or increase their cost we have experienced increased costs and production delays when we were unable to obtain the necessary equipment or sufficient quantities of some components andor have been forced to pay higher prices or make volume purchase commitments or advance deposits for some components equipment or raw materials that were in short supply in the industry in general further if our customers experience shortages of components or materials used in their products it could result in a decrease in demand for our products and have an adverse effect on our results of operations if any major supplier were to restrict the supply available to us or increase the cost of the rare earth elements used in our products we could experience a shortage in supply or an increase in production costs which would adversely affect our results of operations 

s 

from time to time we may be subject to litigation government investigations or governmental proceedings which may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 

from time to time we have been and may continue to be involved in various legal regulatory or administrative investigations negotiations or proceedings arising in the normal course of business  in the event of litigation government investigations or governmental proceedings we are subject to the inherent risks and uncertainties that may result if outcomes differ from our expectations in the event of adverse outcomes in any litigation investigation or government proceeding we could be required to pay substantial damages fines or penalties and cease certain practices or activities which could materially harm our business 

the costs associated with litigation and government investigations can also be unpredictable depending on the complexity and length of time devoted to such litigation or investigation litigation investigations or government proceedings may also divert the efforts and attention of our key personnel which could also harm our business  

if we do not control our fixed costs we will not be able to compete effectively in our industry  

we continually seek to make our cost structure and business processes more efficient we are focused on increasing workforce flexibility and scalability and improving overall competitiveness by leveraging our global capabilities as well as external talent and skills worldwide our strategy involves to a substantial degree increasing revenue and exabytes volume while at the same time controlling operating expenses if we do not control our operating expenses our ability to compete in the marketplace may be impaired in the past activities to reduce operating costs have included closures and transfers of facilities significant personnel reductions restructuring efforts and efforts to increase automation our restructuring efforts may not yield the intended benefits and may be unsuccessful or disruptive to our business operations which may materially adversely affect our financial results  

shortages or delays in critical components as well as reliance on singlesource suppliers can affect our production and development of products and may harm our operating results  

we are dependent on a limited number of qualified suppliers who provide critical materials or components if there is a shortage of or delay in supplying us with critical components equipment or raw materials then  

• it is likely that our suppliers would raise their prices and if we could not pass these price increases to our customers our operating margin would decline 

• we may have to reengineer some products which would likely cause production and shipment delays make the reengineered products more costly and provide us with a lower rate of return on these products 

• we would likely have to allocate the components we receive to certain of our products and ship less of others which could reduce our revenues and could cause us to lose sales to customers who could purchase more of their required products from manufacturers that either did not experience these shortages or delays or that made different allocations and 

• we may be late in shipping products causing potential customers to make purchases from our competitors thus causing our revenue and operating margin to decline 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain critical components in a timely and economic manner many of our suppliers’ manufacturing facilities are fully utilized if they fail to invest in additional capacity or deliver components in the required timeframe such failure would have an impact on our ability to ramp new products and may result in a loss of revenue or market share if our competitors did not utilize the same components and were not affected  

we often aim to lead the market in new technology deployments and leverage unique and customized technology from single source suppliers who are early adopters in the emerging market our options in supplier selection in these cases are limited and the supplier based technology has been and may continue to be single sourced until wider adoption of the technology occurs and any necessary licenses become available in such cases any technical issues in the supplier’s technology may cause us to delay shipments of our new technology deployments and harm our financial position  

s 

if revenues fall or customer demand decreases significantly we may not meet all of our purchase commitments to certain suppliers  

from time to time we enter into longterm noncancelable purchase commitments or make large upfront investments with certain suppliers in order to secure certain components or technologies for the production of our products or to supplement our internal manufacturing capacity for certain components if our actual revenues in the future are lower than our projections or if customer demand decreases significantly below our projections we may not meet all of our purchase commitments with these suppliers as a result it is possible that our revenues will not be sufficient to recoup our upfront investments in which case we will have to shift output from our internal manufacturing facilities to these suppliers or make penaltytype payments under the terms of these contracts additionally because our markets are volatile competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes we face inventory and other asset risks in the event we do not fully utilize firm purchase commitments 

the loss of key executive officers and employees could negatively impact our business prospects  

our future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued service of key members of management as well as marketing sales and product development personnel we believe our future success will also depend in large part upon our ability to attract retain and further motivate highly skilled management marketing sales and product development personnel we have experienced intense competition for personnel and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our key employees or that we will be successful in attracting assimilating and retaining personnel in the future additionally because a portion of our key personnel’s compensation is contingent upon the performance of our business including through cash bonuses and equity compensation when our results of operations or financial condition are negatively impacted we may be at a competitive disadvantage for retaining and hiring employees the loss of one or more of our key personnel or the inability to hire and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

due to the complexity of our products some defects may only become detectable after deployment  

our products are highly complex and are designed to operate in and form part of larger complex networks and storage systems our products may contain a defect or be perceived as containing a defect by our customers as a result of improper use or maintenance lead times required to manufacture certain components are significant and a quality excursion may take significant time and resources to remediate defects in our products thirdparty components or in the networks and systems of which they form a part directly or indirectly have resulted in and may in the future result in  

• increased costs and product delays until complex solution level interoperability issues are resolved 

• costs associated with the remediation of any problems attributable to our products 

• loss of or delays in revenues 

• loss of customers 

• failure to achieve market acceptance and loss of market share 

• increased service and warranty costs and 

• increased insurance costs 

defects in our products could also result in legal actions by our customers for property damage injury or death such legal actions including but not limited to product liability claims could exceed the level of insurance coverage that we have obtained any significant uninsured claims could significantly harm our financial condition

we may pursue strategic alliances acquisitions joint ventures and investment opportunities that involve risks that could adversely affect our results of operations 

from time to time we pursue strategic alliances acquisitions joint ventures and investments in other companies that are complementary to our business there is substantial competition for attractive strategic alliance acquisition joint venture and investment candidates therefore we may not be able to identify suitable strategic alliances acquisition joint venture or investment candidates even if we can identify them the terms on which we are able to consummate a transaction may not be commercially reasonable for us to pursue we cannot assure you that we will be able to partner with acquire or invest in suitable candidates or integrate acquired technologies or operations successfully into our existing technologies and operations moreover our ability to finance potential strategic alliances acquisitions joint ventures or investments may be limited by market conditions our leverage level the covenants contained in the instruments that govern our outstanding indebtedness and any agreements governing any other debt we may incur in addition our cash reserves could diminish significantly as a result of any acquisitions joint ventures strategic alliances or other investments we pursue even if we are successful in forming strategic alliances or acquiring forming joint ventures with or making investments in other companies we cannot be certain that we will realize the anticipated benefits or synergies of any strategic alliance acquisition joint venture or investment that we pursue which could cause among other things an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets if our goodwill or net intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a charge to our consolidated statements of comprehensive income which would adversely affect our financial results 

political events war terrorism natural disasters public health issues and other circumstances could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition  

war terrorism geopolitical uncertainties natural disasters public health issues and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy and thus could have a strong negative effect on our business our direct and indirect suppliers logistics providers manufacturing vendors and customers our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes fires power or water shortages terrorist attacks other hostile acts labor disputes public health issues such as the covid19 pandemic and other events beyond our control such events may decrease demand for our products make it difficult or impossible for us to make and deliver products to our customers or to receive components from our direct and indirect suppliers and create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain in the event of a natural disaster losses and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected should major public health issues including pandemics arise we could be negatively affected by stringent employee travel restrictions additional limitations or cost increases in freight and other logistical services governmental actions limiting the movement of products or employees between regions increases in or changes to data collection and reporting obligations delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in our operations and those of some of our key direct and indirect suppliers and customers for example the recent covid19 pandemic has resulted in governmentimposed travel restrictions border closures stayathome orders facility closures or operating constraints in a number of locations including but not limited to china malaysia singapore and the united states disruptions in our operations and those of our suppliers partners and customers increases in air freight rates limited numbers of employees available to staff manufacturing operations and shortages of supplies of personal protective equipment required for our manufacturing operations if any of these circumstances continue for an extended period of time our manufacturing ability and capacity or those of our key direct and indirect suppliers or customers could be impacted and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected

failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations customer requirements and regulations regarding conflicts minerals and other laws and regulations applicable to our business could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition  

the sale and manufacturing of products in certain states and countries has and may continue to subject us and our suppliers to state federal and international laws and regulations governing protection of the environment including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites restrictions on the presence of certain substances in electronic products and the responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling we endeavor to ensure that we and our suppliers comply with all applicable environmental laws and regulations however compliance has increased and may continue to increase our operating costs and may otherwise impact future financial results if additional or more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future we could incur additional operating costs and capital expenditures if we fail to comply with applicable environmental laws regulations initiatives or standards of conduct our customers may refuse to purchase our products and we could be subject to fines penalties and possible prohibition of sales of our products into one or more states or countries liability to our customers and damage to our reputation which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

sec rules require certain disclosures regarding the use of specified minerals often referred to as conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured these rules could affect our ability to source directly or indirectly certain materials used in our products at competitive prices and could impact the availability of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products including gold tantalum tin and tungsten as there may be only a limited number of suppliers of “conflict free” minerals we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary conflict free minerals in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices our customers including our oem customers may require that our products be free of conflict minerals and our revenues and margins may be harmed if we are unable to procure conflict free minerals at a reasonable price or at all or are unable to pass through any increased costs associated with meeting these demands we may also face challenges with government regulators and our customers and suppliers if we are unable to sufficiently verify that the metals used in our products are conflict free furthermore our customers and manufacturing stakeholders may place increased demands on our compliance framework which may in turn negatively impact our relationships with our suppliers if we are unable to comply with requirements regarding the use of conflict and other minerals our business financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

any cost reduction initiatives that we undertake may not deliver the results we expect and these actions may adversely affect our business  

from time to time we engage in restructuring plans that have resulted and may continue to result in workforce reduction and consolidation of our real estate facilities and our manufacturing footprint in addition management will continue to evaluate our global footprint and cost structure and additional restructuring plans are expected to be formalized as a result of our restructurings we have experienced and may in the future experience a loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge disruptions to our operations and inefficiency during transitional periods additionally global footprint consolidation and reduction in excess capacity may result in us being unable to respond to increases in forecasted volume of customer demand and loss of revenue opportunity if our competitors have underutilized factories any costcutting measures could impact employee retention in addition we cannot be sure that any future cost reductions or global footprint consolidations will deliver the results we expect be successful in reducing our overall expenses as we expect or that additional costs will not offset any such reductions or global footprint consolidation if our operating costs are higher than we expect or if we do not maintain adequate control of our costs and expenses our results of operations may be adversely affected 

our ability to use our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be limited  

the use of a portion of our us net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards is subject to annual limitations pursuant to us tax law sections 382 and 383 of the us internal revenue code generally impose annual limitations on the amount of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that may be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone significant changes in ownership as a result future changes in ownership could put further limitations on the availability of our net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards  see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data — note 5 income taxes ” contained in this report for among other things a description of current net operating loss and tax credit carryforward limitations

we are at times subject to intellectual property proceedings and claims which could cause us to incur significant additional costs or prevent us from selling our products and which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition  

we are subject from timetotime to legal proceedings and claims including claims of alleged infringement of the patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties by us or our customers in connection with the use of our products intellectual property litigation can be expensive and timeconsuming regardless of the merits of any claim and could divert our management’s attention from operating our business in addition intellectual property lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties due to the complexity of the technical issues involved which may cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations patent litigation has increased due to the current uncertainty of the law and the increasing competition and overlap of product functionality in the field some of the actions that we face from timetotime seek injunctions against the sale of our products andor substantial monetary damages which if granted or awarded could materially harm our business financial condition and operating results  

we cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of others we may not be aware of currently filed patent applications that relate to our products or technology if patents are later issued on these applications we may be liable for infringement if our products were found to infringe the intellectual property rights of others we could be required to pay substantial damages cease the manufacture use and sale of infringing products in one or more geographic locations expend significant resources to develop noninfringing technology discontinue the use of specific processes or obtain licenses to the technology infringed we might not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms or at all or be able to reengineer our products successfully to avoid infringement any of the foregoing could cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling our products which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data — note 14 legal environmental and other contingencies ” contained in this report for a description of pending intellectual property proceedings  

we may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations  

we rely on a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws confidentiality agreements security measures and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights in the past we have been involved in significant and expensive disputes regarding our intellectual property rights and those of others including claims that we may be infringing patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights of thirdparties we expect that we will be involved in similar disputes in the future  

there can be no assurance tha t 

• any of our existing patents will continue to be held valid if challenged 

• patents will be issued for any of our pending applications 

• any claims allowed from existing or pending patents will have sufficient scope or strength to protect us 

• our patents will be issued in the primary countries where our products are sold in order to protect our rights and potential commercial advantage 

• we will be able to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality agreements with our customers suppliers and employees and through other security measures and 

• others will not gain access to our trade secrets 

in addition our competitors may be able to design their products around our patents and other proprietary rights enforcement of our rights often requires litigation if we bring a patent infringement action and are not successful our competitors would be able to use similar technology to compete with us moreover the defendant in such an action may successfully countersue us for infringement of their patents or assert a counterclaim that our patents are invalid or unenforceable  

furthermore we have significant operations and sales in countries where intellectual property laws and enforcement policies are often less developed less stringent or more difficult to enforce than in the united states therefore we cannot be certain that we will be able to protect our intellectual property rights in jurisdictions outside the united states

the price of our ordinary shares may be volatile and could decline significantly  

the market price of our ordinary shares has experienced price fluctuations and could be subject to wide fluctuations in the future the market price of our ordinary shares has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly in response to various factors including  

• general uncertainty in stock market conditions occasioned by global economic conditions and negative financial news unrelated to our business or industry including the impact of the recent covid19 pandemic 

• the timing and amount of our share repurchases 

• actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations 

• announcements of innovations new products or significant price reductions by us or our competitors including those competitors who offer alternative storage technology solutions 

• our failure to meet our guidance or the performance estimates of investment research analysts 

• the timing of announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts or acquisitions 

• significant announcements by or changes in financial condition of a large customer 

• general stock market conditions 

• actual or perceived security breaches or security vulnerabilities 

• the occurrence of major catastrophic events 

• changes in financial estimates by investment research analysts 

• actual or anticipated changes in the credit ratings of our indebtedness by rating agencies and 

• the sale of our ordinary shares held by certain equity investors or members of management 

market price fluctuations of our ordinary shares has impacted and could continue to impact the value of our equity compensation which could affect our ability to recruit and retain employees in addition in the past following periods of decline in the market price of a company’s securities class action lawsuits have often been pursued against that company if similar litigation were pursued against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

any decision to reduce or discontinue the payment of cash dividends to our shareholders or the repurchase of our ordinary shares pursuant to our previously announced share repurchase program could cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline significantly  

although historically we have announced regular cash dividend payments and a share repurchase program we are under no obligation to pay cash dividends to our shareholders in the future at historical levels or at all or to repurchase our ordinary shares at any particular price or at all the declaration and payment of any future dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors our previously announced share repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time our payment of quarterly cash dividends and the repurchase of our ordinary shares pursuant to our share repurchase program are subject to among other things our financial position and results of operations available cash and cash flow capital and regulatory requirements market and economic conditions our ordinary share price and other factors any reduction or discontinuance by us of the payment of quarterly cash dividends or the repurchase of our ordinary shares pursuant to our share repurchase program could cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline significantly moreover in the event our payment of quarterly cash dividends or repurchases of our ordinary shares are reduced or discontinued our failure to resume such activities at historical levels could result in a persistent lower market valuation of our ordinary shares

impact of covid19 

the covid19 pandemic has resulted in a widespread health crisis and numerous disease control measures being taken to limit its spread the effects of which began during our quarter ended april 3 2020 we incurred certain supply chain and demand disruptions during the fiscal year 2020 as well as factory underutilization and higher logistics and operational costs and softer demand across our markets due to the covid19 pandemic which we expect to continue into our fiscal year 2021 our customers also experienced certain supply chain and demand disruptions in our fourth fiscal quarter 2020 which we anticipate will continue into fiscal year 2021 we are continuing to actively monitor the effects and potential impacts of the covid19 pandemic on all aspects of our business liquidity and capital resources we are complying with governmental rules and guidelines across all of our sites and are actively working on opportunities to lower our cost structure and drive further operational efficiencies although we are unable to predict the impact of covid19 on our business results of operations liquidity or capital resources at this time we expect we will be negatively affected if the pandemic and related public and private health measures result in substantial manufacturing or supply chain problems substantial reductions in demand due to disruptions in the operations of our customers or partners disruptions in local and global economies volatility in the global financial markets sustained reductions or volatility in overall demand trends restrictions on the export or shipment of our products or other ramifications from the covid19 pandemic for a further discussion of the uncertainties and business risks associated with the covid19 pandemic see the section entitled “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this annual report

our income tax provision recorded for fiscal year 2020 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying the irish statutory rate of 25 to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i tax benefits related to nonus and nonirish earnings generated in jurisdictions that are subject to tax incentive programs and are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of ireland and ii tax benefits related to research credits our income tax benefit recorded for fiscal year 2019 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying the irish statutory rate of 25 to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i a decrease in valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets primarily driven by improvements in our profitability outlook in the us and ii tax benefits related to nonus and nonirish earnings generated in jurisdictions that are subject to tax incentive programs and are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of ireland 

based on our nonirish ownership structure and subject to i potential future increases in our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and ii a future change in our intention to indefinitely reinvest earnings from our subsidiaries outside of ireland we anticipate that our effective tax rate in future periods will generally be less than the irish statutory rate

liquidity and capital resources 

the following sections discuss our principal liquidity requirements as well as our sources and uses of cash and our liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase the principal objectives of our investment policy are the preservation of principal and maintenance of liquidity we believe our cash equivalents are liquid and accessible during fiscal year 2020 we reduced and restructured our longterm debt portfolio through a combination of new issuances repurchases and exchanges to lower annual repayment levels by extending the maturity dates of certain notes and lowering the average interest rates we operate in some countries that have restrictive regulations over the movement of cash andor foreign exchange across their borders however we believe our sources of cash have been and will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the next 12 months although there can be no assurance we believe that our financial resources along with controlling our costs will allow us to manage the potential impacts of the covid19 pandemic on our business operations for the foreseeable future however the challenges posed by covid19 to our industry and to our business are evolving rapidly and are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time consequently we will continue to evaluate our financial position in light of future developments particularly those relating to covid19

liquidity sources 

our primary sources of liquidity as of july 3 2020 consist of 1 approximately 17 billion in cash and cash equivalents 2 cash we expect to generate from operations and 3 subject to compliance with certain requirements under our control up to 15 billion available for borrowing under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility “revolving credit facility” which is part of our credit agreement the “credit agreement” 

as of july 3 2020 no borrowings had been drawn and no borrowings had been utilized for letters of credit or swing line loans issued under the revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility is available for borrowings subject to compliance with financial covenants and other customary conditions to borrowing 

the credit agreement includes three financial covenants 1 interest coverage ratio 2 total leverage ratio and 3 a minimum liquidity amount the term of the revolving credit facility is through february 20 2024 and the maturity date of the term loan is september 16 2025 

as of july 3 2020 cash and cash equivalents held by nonirish subsidiaries was 17 billion this amount is potentially subject to taxation in ireland upon repatriation by means of a dividend into our irish parent however it is our intent to indefinitely reinvest earnings of nonirish subsidiaries outside of ireland and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate such earnings by means of a taxable irish dividend should funds be needed in the irish parent company and should we be unable to fund parent company activities through means other than a taxable irish dividend we would be required to accrue and pay irish taxes on such dividend 

we believe that our sources of cash will be sufficient to fund our operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months for additional information on factors that could impact our ability to fund our operations and meet our cash requirements including the covid19 pandemic see the section entitled “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this annual report 

s 

cash requirements and commitments 

our liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital product development and capital expenditure needs to fund scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness and to fund our quarterly dividend and any future strategic investments our ability to fund these requirements will depend on our future cash flows which are determined by future operating performance and therefore subject to prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and financial business and other factors some of which are beyond our control 

on july 22 2020 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 065 per share which will be payable on october 7 2020 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on september 23 2020 

as of july 3 2020 we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our debt agreements based on our current outlook and the information we currently have available to us we expect to be in compliance with the covenants in our debt agreements over the next 12 months 

the carrying value of our debt as of july 3 2020 and june 28 2019 was 42 billion and 43 billion respectively the table below presents the principal amounts of our outstanding debt 



from time to time we may repurchase any of our outstanding ordinary shares through private open market or broker assisted purchases tender offers or other means during fiscal year 2020 we repurchased approximately 18 million of our ordinary shares including shares withheld for statutory tax withholdings related to vesting of employee equity awards see “item 5 market for registrants common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securitiesrepurchases of our equity securities” as of july 3 2020 13 billion remained available for repurchase under our existing repurchase authorization limit all repurchases are effected as redemptions in accordance with our constitution 

for fiscal year 2021 we expect capital expenditures to be at or below our longterm targeted range of 6 to 8 of revenue we require substantial amounts of cash to fund any increased working capital requirements future capital expenditures scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness and payments of dividends we will continue to evaluate and manage the retirement and replacement of existing debt and associated obligations including evaluating the issuance of new debt securities exchanging existing debt securities for other debt securities and retiring debt pursuant to privately negotiated transactions open market purchases tender offers or other means or otherwise in addition we may selectively pursue strategic alliances acquisitions joint ventures and investments which may require additional capital 

s 

contractual obligations and commitments 

our contractual cash obligations and commitments as of july 3 2020 are summarized in the table below 



 

1 purchase obligations are defined as contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services which are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms 

2 includes total future minimum rent expense under noncancelable leases for both occupied and vacated facilities rent expense is shown net of sublease income refer to “ item 8 financial statements and supplementary data— note 6 leases” for details 

as of july 3 2020 we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits and an accrual for the payment of related interest totaling 2 million none of which is expected to be settled within one year outside of one year we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlement with a taxing authority will occur 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of july 3 2020 we did not have any material offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of regulation sk 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the methods estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements the sec has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are highly uncertain at the time of estimation based on this definition our most critical accounting policies include revenue  sales program accruals warranty income taxes and assessing goodwill and other longlived assets for impairment below we discuss these policies further as well as the estimates and judgments involved we also have other accounting policies and accounting estimates relating to uncollectible customer accounts valuation of inventories valuation of sharebased payments and restructuring we believe that these other accounting policies and accounting estimates either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective or it is less likely that they would have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period 

revenue  sales program accruals we record estimated variable consideration at the time of revenue recognition as a reduction to revenue variable consideration generally consists of sales incentive programs such as price protection and volume incentives aimed at increasing customer demand for oem sales rebates are typically established by estimating the most likely amount of consideration expected to be received based on an oem customers volume of purchases from us or other agreed upon rebate programs for the distribution and retail channel these sales incentive programs typically involve estimating the most likely amount of rebates related to a customers level of sales order size advertising or point of sale activity as well as the expected value of price protection adjustments based on historical analysis and forecasted pricing environment total sales programs were 12 of gross revenue in fiscal year 2020 and 11 for each of the 2019 and 2018 fiscal years adjustments to revenues due to under or over accruals for sales programs related to revenues reported in prior quarterly periods were less than 1 of gross revenue in fiscal years 2020 2019 and 2018 

s 

warranty we estimate probable product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized we generally provide a warranty on our products for a period of 1 to 5 years our warranty provision considers estimated product failure rates and trends including the timing of product returns during the warranty periods and estimated repair or replacement costs related to product quality issues if any we also exercise judgment in estimating our ability to sell refurbished products based on historical experience our judgment is subject to a greater degree of subjectivity with respect to newly introduced products because of limited experience with those products upon which to base our warranty estimates 

income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits recognition of income and deductions and calculation of specific tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for income tax and financial statement purposes as well as tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions the calculation of tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by various taxing authorities if estimates of these tax liabilities are greater or less than actual results an additional tax provision or benefit will result the deferred tax assets we record each period depend primarily on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states and certain nonus jurisdictions each period we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and if necessary adjust the valuation allowance so that net deferred tax assets are recorded only to the extent we conclude it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized if our outlook for future taxable income changes significantly our assessment of the need for and the amount of a valuation allowance may also change 

assessing goodwill and other longlived assets for impairment we perform a qualitative assessment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist to determine if any events or circumstances exist such as an adverse change in business climate or a decline in the overall industry that would indicate that it would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount based on the qualitative assessment if it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then the company is not required to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test if it is determined in the qualitative assessment that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not below its carrying amount including goodwill then we perform a quantitative impairment test the quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount any excess in the carrying value of a reporting unit over its fair value is recognized as an impairment loss limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 

we evaluate other longlived assets including property equipment and leasehold improvements and other intangible assets subject to amortization for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of those assets may not be recoverable we assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group if the recoverability assessment indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable we will estimate the fair value of the asset group and compare it to its carrying value the excess of the carrying value over the fair value is allocated pro rata to derive the adjusted carrying value of each asset in the asset group the adjusted carrying value of each asset in the asset group is not reduced below its fair value 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data— note 1 basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies” for information regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we have exposure to market risks due to the volatility of interest rates foreign currency exchange rates credit rating changes and equity and bond markets a portion of these risks may be hedged but fluctuations could impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash investment portfolio as of july 3 2020 we had no availableforsale debt securities that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for a period greater than 12 months we determined no availableforsale debt securities were otherthantemporarily impaired as of july 3 2020 

we have fixed rate and variable rate debt obligations we enter into debt obligations for general corporate purposes including capital expenditures and working capital needs our term loan bears interest at a variable rate equal to london interbank offered rate “libor” plus a variable margin set on june 19 2020

in the quarter ended october 4 2019 we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of 500 million to convert the variable interest rate on the term loan to fixed interest rates the contracts were effective as of october 4 2019 and will mature on september 16 2025 the objective of the interest rate swap agreements is to eliminate the variability of interest payment cash flows associated with the variable interest rate on the term loan the company designated the interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges

industry overview 

data storage industry 

the data storage industry includes companies that manufacture components or subcomponents designed for data storage devices and companies that provide storage solutions software and services for enterprise cloud big data computing platforms and consumer markets the rapid growth in data generation and the intelligent application of data are driving demand for data storage as more data is created at endpoints outside traditional data centers and requires processing at the edge the need for data storage and management has also increased examples of this include autonomous vehicles smart manufacturing systems and smart cities we believe the proliferation and personal creation of mediarich digital content further enabled by fifthgeneration wireless “5g” the edge the internet of things “iot” and artificial intelligence “ai” will continue to create demand for higher capacity storage solutions the new ecosystem is expected to require increasing amounts of data storage both at the edge and in enterprises that store the data 

markets 

the principal data storage markets include 

enterprise storage we define enterprise storage as dedicated storage area networks and hyperscale cloud storage environments enterprise and cloud data centers run solutions which are designed for nearline mission critical and enterprise ssd applications 

nearline applications are defined as those which require high capacity and energy efficient storage solutions we expect such applications which include storage for cloud computing content delivery and backup services will continue to grow and drive exabyte demand additionally with the increased requirements for storage capacity and performance driven by the creation and consumption of mediarich content we expect that the increased exabyte demand will require further buildout of data centers by cloud service providers “csps” and other enterprises that use highcapacity nearline devices 

mission critical applications are defined as those that use high performance enterprise class hdds and ssds with sophisticated firmware enterprise storage is vital to the operation of largescale enterprise workloads requiring high performance and high reliability storage solutions we expect the market for mission critical enterprise storage solutions to continue to be driven by enterprises utilizing dedicated storage area networks 

 

seagate technology public limited company  2019 form 10k  3 

edge noncompute we define edge noncompute applications as solutions designed primarily for consumer electronic devices that require a higher capacity low costpergigabyte storage solution including surveillance nas dvrs and gaming consumer solutions support a variety of consumer and industrial needs with internal and external storage solutions disk drives for external storage are designed for purposes such as portable external storage and to augment storage capacity in the consumer’s current desktop notebook tablet or mobile phone device 

edge compute we define edge compute applications as solutions designed for desktop and mobile compute applications ranging from traditional laptops to convertible systems some edge compute applications rely less on builtin storage and instead rely on cloud storage for longterm archiving 

enterprise data solutions we define enterprise data solutions as applications that provide endtoend solutions to businesses for the purpose of modular systems and scaleout storage applications can contain hdds and ssds and may offer file management systems software and compute power enabling both private and public clouds 

participants in the data storage industry include 

major subcomponent manufacturers companies that manufacture components or subcomponents used in data storage devices or solutions include companies that supply spindle motors heads and media and application specific integrated circuits “asics” 

storage device manufacturers companies that transform components into storage products include disk drive manufacturers and semiconductor storage manufacturers which integrate flash memory into storage products such as ssds 

storage solutions manufacturers and system integrators companies such as oems that bundle and package storage solutions distributors that integrate storage hardware and software into enduser applications csps that provide cloud based solutions to businesses for the purpose of scaleout storage solutions and modular systems and producers of solutions such as storage racks 

hyperscale data centers large hyperscale data center companies many of which are csps are increasingly designing their own storage subsystems and having them built by contract manufacturers for use inside their own data centers this trend is reshaping the storage system and subsystem market and driving innovation in system design and changes in the competitive landscape of large storage system vendors 

storage services companies that provide and host services and solutions which include storage backup archiving recovery and discovery of data 

demand for data storage 

the international data corporation “idc” forecasted in its 2018 digitization of the world study that the global datasphere will grow from 33 zettabytes in 2018 to 175 zettabytes by 2025 according to idc we are fast approaching a new era of the data age which we expect will have a positive impact on storage demand the digital transformation has given rise to many new applications all of which rely on faster access to and a secure storage of an increasing amount of data 

as more applications require realtime decision making more data processing and storage is moving near the edge of the network which we believe will result in a buildup in private and edge cloud environments that will enable fast and secure access to data throughout the iot ecosystem 

factors contributing to the growth of digital content include 

 

  

  

seagate technology public limited company  2019 form 10k  4 

  

  

  

 as a result of these factors we anticipate that the nature and volume of content being created will require greater storage capability which is more efficiently and economically facilitated by higher capacity storage devices in order to store aggregate host distribute analyze manage protect backup and use such content 

in addition the economics of storage infrastructure are also evolving with the utilization of public and private hyperscale storage and opensource solutions reducing the total cost of ownership of storage while increasing the speed and efficiency with which customers can leverage massive computing and storage devices accordingly we expect these trends will continue to create significant demand for data storage solutions going forward 

demand trends 

we believe that continued growth in digital content creation requires increasingly higher storage capacity in order to store aggregate host distribute analyze manage protect back up and use such content we also believe that as architectures evolve to serve the growing commercial and consumer user base throughout the world the storage solutions will evolve as well 

we expect increased data creation will lead to the expansion of the need for storage in the form of hdds eds and ssds while the advance of solid state technology in many end markets is expected to increase we believe that in the foreseeable future cloud traditional enterprise edge noncompute and edge compute markets that require highcapacity storage solutions will be best served by hard disk drives due to their ability to deliver the most cost effective reliable and energyefficient mass storage devices we also believe that as hard disk drive capacities continue to increase a focus exclusively on unit demand does not reflect the increase in demand for exabytes as demand for higher capacity drives increases the demand profile has shifted to reflect fewer total hdd units but with higher average capacity per drive and higher overall exabyte demand 

industry supply balance 

from time to time the storage industry has experienced periods of imbalance between supply and demand to the extent that the storage industry builds or maintains capacity based on expectations of demand that do not materialize price erosion may become more pronounced conversely during periods where demand exceeds supply price erosion is generally muted 

our business 

data storage technologies 

the design and manufacturing of hdds depends on highly advanced technology and manufacturing techniques therefore it requires high levels of research and development spending and capital equipment investments we design fabricate and assemble a number of the most important components in our disk drives including readwrite heads and recording media our design and manufacturing operations are based on technology platforms that are used to produce various disk drive products that serve multiple data storage applications and markets our core technology platforms including upcoming innovations like the throughputoptimizing mach2 and the highcapacity enabling heatedassisted magnetic reading “hamr” are focused around the areal density of media and readwrite head technologies this design and manufacturing approach allows us to deliver a portfolio of disk drive products to service a wide range of data storage applications and industries 

 

seagate technology public limited company  2019 form 10k  5 

disk drives that we manufacture are commonly differentiated by the following key characteristics 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 areal density is measured by storage capacity per square inch on the recording surface of a disk the storage capacity of a disk drive is determined by the size and number of disks it contains as well as the areal density capability of these disks 

we also offer ssds as part of our storage solutions portfolio our portfolio includes devices with sas and nvme interfaces the ssds differ from hdds in that they are without mechanical parts 

ssds store data on nand flash memory cells or metaloxide semiconductor transistors using a charge on a capacitor to represent a binary digit ssd technology offers fast access to data and robust performance ssds complement missioncritical enterprise applications hyperscale applications highdensity data centers cloud environments and web servers 

the sshds that we manufacture contain a technology that fuses some features of ssds and hdds they include high capacity hdds with flash memory that acts as a cache to improve performance of frequently accessed data 

manufacturing 

we design and produce our own readwrite heads and recording media which are critical technologies for disk drives this integrated approach enables us to lower costs and to improve the functionality of components so that they work together efficiently 

we believe that because of our vertical design and manufacturing strategy we are well suited to take advantage of the opportunities to leverage the close interdependence of components for disk drives our manufacturing efficiency and flexibility are critical elements of our integrated business strategy we continuously seek to improve our manufacturing efficiency and reduce manufacturing costs by 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

seagate technology public limited company  2019 form 10k  6 

a vertically integrated model however tends to have less flexibility when demand moderates as it exposes us to higher unit costs when capacity utilization is not optimized 

components and raw materials 

disk drives incorporate certain components including a head disk assembly and a printed circuit board mounted to the head disk assembly which are sealed inside a rigid base and top cover containing the recording components in a contamination controlled environment we maintain a highly integrated approach to our business by designing and manufacturing a significant portion of the components we view as critical to our products such as readwrite heads and recording media 

readwrite heads the function of the readwrite head is to scan across the disk as it spins magnetically recording or reading information the tolerances of readwrite heads are extremely demanding and require stateoftheart equipment and processes our readwrite heads are manufactured with thinfilm and photolithographic processes similar to those used to produce semiconductor integrated circuits though challenges related to magnetic film properties and topographical structures are unique to the disk drive industry we perform all primary stages of design and manufacture of readwrite heads at our facilities we use a combination of internally manufactured and externally sourced readwrite heads the mix of which varies based on product mix technology and our internal capacity levels 

media data is written to or read from the media or disk as it rotates at very high speeds past the readwrite head the media is made from nonmagnetic substrates usually an aluminum alloy or glass and is coated with thin layers of magnetic materials we use a combination of internally manufactured and externally sourced finished media and aluminum substrates the mix of which varies based on product mix technology and our internal capacity levels we purchase all of our glass substrates from third parties 

printed circuit board assemblies the printed circuit board assemblies “pcbas” are comprised of standard and custom asics and ancillary electronic control chips the asics control the movement of data to and from the readwrite heads and through the internal controller and interface which communicates with the host computer the asics and control chips form electronic circuitry that delivers instructions to a head positioning mechanism called an actuator to guide the heads to the selected track of a disk where the data is recorded or retrieved disk drive manufacturers use one or more industry standard interfaces such as serial advanced technology architecture “sata” small computer system interface “scsi” or sas to communicate to the host systems 

head disk assembly the head disk assembly consists of one or more disks attached to a spindle assembly powered by a spindle motor that rotates the disks at a high constant speed around a hub readwrite heads mounted on an arm assembly similar in concept to that of a record player fly extremely close to each disk surface and record data on and retrieve it from concentric tracks in the magnetic layers of the rotating disks the readwrite heads are mounted vertically on an eshaped assembly “eblock” that is actuated by a voicecoil motor to allow the heads to move from track to track the eblock and the recording media are mounted inside the head disk assembly we purchase spindle motors from outside vendors and from time to time participate in the design of the motors that go into our products 

disk drive assembly following the completion of the head disk assembly it is mated to the pcba and the completed unit goes through extensive defect mapping and machine learning prior to packaging and shipment disk drive assembly and machine learning operations occur primarily at our facilities located in china and thailand we perform subassembly and component manufacturing operations at our facilities in china malaysia northern ireland singapore thailand and the united states 

contract manufacturing we outsource the manufacturing and assembly of certain components and products to third parties in various countries worldwide this includes outsourcing the pcbas used in our disk drives ssds and storage subsystems we continue to participate in the design of our components and products and are directly involved in qualifying key suppliers and components used in our products 

suppliers of components and industry constraints there are a limited number of independent suppliers of components such as recording heads and media available to disk drive manufacturers vertically integrated disk drive manufacturers who 

 

seagate technology public limited company  2019 form 10k  7 

manufacture their own components are less dependent on external component suppliers than less vertically integrated disk drive manufacturers however our business has been adversely affected by our suppliers’ capacity constraints in the past and this could occur again 

commodity and other manufacturing costs the production of disk drives requires rare earth elements precious metals scarce alloys and industrial commodities which are subject to fluctuations in price and the supply of which has at times been constrained in addition to increased costs of components and commodities volatility in fuel costs may also increase our costs related to commodities manufacturing and freight as a result we may increase our use of alternative shipment methods to help offset any increase in freight costs and we will continually review various forms of shipments and routes in order to minimize the exposure to higher freight costs

our distributors generally enter into nonexclusive agreements for the resale of our products they typically furnish us with a nonbinding indication of their nearterm requirements and product deliveries are generally scheduled accordingly the agreements and related sales programs typically provide the distributors with limited rights of return and price protection rights in addition we offer sales programs to distributors on a quarterly and periodic basis to promote the sale of selected products in the sales channel 

our retail channel consists of our branded storage products sold to retailers either by us directly or by our distributors retail sales made by us or our distributors typically require greater marketing support sales incentives and price protection periods 

see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data— note 13 b usiness segment and geographic information ” contained in this report for a description of our major customers 

competition 

we compete primarily with manufacturers of hard drives used in the enterprise edge noncompute and edge compute applications and with other companies in the data storage industry that provide ssds and eds some of the principal factors used by customers to differentiate among data storage solutions manufacturers are storage capacity product performance product quality and reliability price per unit and price per terabyte storageretrieval access times data transfer rates form factor product warranty and support capabilities supply continuity and flexibility power consumption total cost of ownership and brand while different markets and customers place varying levels of emphasis on these factors we believe that our products are competitive with respect to many of these factors in the markets that we currently address 

principal competitors we compete with manufacturers of storage solutions and the principal manufacturers in the data storage solution industry include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

seagate technology public limited company  2019 form 10k  9 

price erosion historically our industry has been characterized by price declines for data storage products with comparable capacity performance and feature sets “likeforlike products” price declines for likeforlike products “price erosion” tend to be more pronounced during periods of 

 

  

  

 data storage manufacturers typically attempt to offset price erosion with an improved mix of data storage products characterized by higher capacity better performance and additional feature sets and product cost reductions 

we believe the data storage industry experienced modest price erosion in fiscal years 2019 2018 and 2017 

product life cycles and changing technology success in our industry has been dependent to a large extent on the ability to balance the introduction and transition of new products with timetovolume performance capacity and quality metrics at a competitive price level of service and support that our customers expect generally the drive manufacturer that introduces a new product first benefits from improved product mix favorable profit margins and less pricing pressure until comparable products are introduced changing technology also necessitates ongoing investments in research and development which may be difficult to recover due to rapid product life cycles and economic declines further there is a continued need to successfully execute product transitions and new product introductions as factors such as quality reliability and manufacturing yields continue to be of significant competitive importance 

seasonality 

the disk drive industry traditionally experiences seasonal variability in demand with higher levels of demand in the second half of the calendar year this seasonality is driven by consumer spending in the backtoschool season from late summer to fall and the traditional holiday shopping season from fall to winter beyond traditional seasonality variability of sales can be related to the timing of it spending or a reflection of cyclical demand from csps based on the timing of their procurement and deployment requirements and the supply and demand balance of other components such as nand and dram 

research and development 

we are committed to developing new component technologies products and alternative storage technologies our research and development focus is designed to bring new products to market in high volume with quality attributes that our customers expect before our competitors part of our product development strategy is to leverage a design platform andor subsystem within product families to serve different market needs this platform strategy allows for more efficient resource utilization leverages best design practices reduces exposure to changes in demand and allows for achievement of lower costs through purchasing economies our advanced technology integration effort focuses disk drive and component research on recording subsystems including readwrite heads and recording media marketspecific product technology and technology we believe may lead to new business opportunities the primary purpose of our advanced technology integration effort is to ensure timely availability of mature component technologies for our product development teams as well as to allow us to leverage and coordinate those technologies in the design centers across our products in order to take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace 

patents and licenses 

as of june 28 2019 we had approximately 6000 us patents and 1300 patents issued in various foreign jurisdictions as well as approximately 900 us and 500 foreign patent applications pending the number of patents and patent applications will vary at any given time as part of our ongoing patent portfolio management activity due to the rapid technological change that characterizes the data storage industry we believe that in addition to patent protection the improvement of existing products reliance upon trade secrets protection of unpatented proprietary knowhow and development of new products are also important to our business in establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage accordingly we intend to continue our efforts to broadly protect our intellectual property including obtaining patents where available in connection with our research and development program 

 

seagate technology public limited company  2019 form 10k  10 

the data storage industry is characterized by significant litigation arising from time to time relating to patent and other intellectual property rights from time to time we receive claims that our products infringe patents of third parties although we have been able to resolve some of those claims or potential claims without a material adverse effect on us other claims have resulted in adverse decisions or settlements in addition other claims are pending which if resolved unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations for more information on these claims see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data— note 14 legal environmental and other contingencies ” the costs of engaging in intellectual property litigation in the past have been and in the future may be substantial irrespective of the merits of the claim or the outcome 

backlog 

in view of industry practice whereby customers may cancel or defer orders with little or no penalty we believe backlog for our business is of limited indicative value in estimating future performance and results 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to us and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites some of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution and these permits are subject to modification renewal and revocation by issuing authorities 

we have established environmental management systems and continually update environmental policies and standard operating procedures for our operations worldwide we believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws regulations and permits we budget for operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental laws if additional or more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future we could incur additional operating costs and capital expenditures 

some environmental laws such as the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended the “superfund” law and its state equivalents can impose liability for the cost of cleanup of contaminated sites upon any of the current or former site owners or operators or upon parties who sent waste to these sites regardless of whether the owner or operator owned the site at the time of the release of hazardous substances or the lawfulness of the original disposal activity we have been identified as a responsible or potentially responsible party at several sites at each of these sites we have an assigned portion of the financial liability based on the type and amount of hazardous substances disposed of by each party at the site and the number of financially viable parties we have fulfilled our responsibilities at some of these sites and remain involved in only a few at this time 

while our ultimate costs in connection with these sites are difficult to predict based on current estimates of cleanup costs and our expected allocation of these costs we do not expect costs in connection with these sites to be material 

we may be subject to various state federal and international laws and regulations governing environmental matters including those restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products for example the european union “eu” has enacted the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment which prohibits the use of certain substances including lead in certain products including disk drives and server storage products put on the market after july 1 2006 similar legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions including in the united states canada mexico taiwan china japan and others the european union reach directive registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals ec 19072006 also restricts substances of very high concern “svhcs” in products 

employees 

at june 28 2019 we employed approximately 40500 employees and temporary employees worldwide of which approximately 33500 were located in our asia operations we believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees at all levels we believe that our employee relations are good

 item 1a risk factors 

tableend we operate in highly competitive markets and our failure to anticipate and respond to technological changes and other market developments including price could harm our ability to compete  

we face intense competition in the data storage industry our principal sources of competition include 

 

  

 the markets for our data storage products are characterized by technological change which is driven in part by the adoption of new industry standards these standards provide mechanisms to ensure technology component interoperability but they also hinder our ability to innovate or differentiate our products when this occurs our products may be deemed commodities which could result in downward pressure on prices 

we also experience competition from other companies that produce alternative storage technologies such as flash memory where increasing capacity decreasing cost energy efficiency and improvements in performance have resulted in increased competition with our lower capacity smaller form factor disk drives some customers for both enterprise and edge compute applications have adopted ssds as an alternative to hard drives in certain applications further adoption of alternative storage technologies may impact the competitiveness of our product portfolio and reduce our market share any resulting increase in competition could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition the barriers to entry into our markets could be lowered allowing large ems and cem companies that utilize generalpurpose design skills to enter our markets and reduce the value of our specialized research and design skills if our markets become more commoditized and we fail to deliver innovative alternative products to our customers or match the price declines or cost efficiencies we will have difficulty competing against the large ems and cem companies this could result in lower profit margins or a loss of market share any significant decline in our market share in any of our principal markets would adversely affect our results of operations 

we must plan our investments in our products and incur costs before we have customer orders or know about the market conditions at the time the products are produced if we fail to predict demand accurately for our products or if the markets for our products change we may be unable to meet demand or we may have insufficient demand which may materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations  

our industry operates primarily on quarterly purchasing cycles with most of the orders typically coming at the end of each quarter our manufacturing process requires us to make significant productspecific investments in inventory each quarter for production in that quarter or a specific quarter in the future as a result we incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales that may never materialize or that may be substantially lower than expected if actual demand for our products is lower than the forecast we may also experience higher inventory carrying costs manufacturing rework costs and product obsolescence conversely if we underestimate demand we may have insufficient inventory to satisfy demand and may have to forego sales 

other factors that may affect our ability to anticipate or meet the demand for our products and adversely affect our results of operations include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

seagate technology public limited company  2019 form 10k  14 

  

 in addition we derive a portion of our revenues in each quarter from a number of relatively large orders if one or more of our key customers decides to defer or cancel a purchase order or delay product acceptance in any given quarter our revenues for that quarter may be significantly reduced and fall below our expectations conversely if one of our key customers unexpectedly increases its orders we may be unable to produce the additional product volumes in a timely manner or take advantage of any overall increased market demand this could damage our customer relationships and reputation which may adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in demand for computer systems and storage subsystems may in the future cause a decline in demand for our products  

our products are components in computers data storage systems and consumer electronic devices historically the demand for these products has been volatile unexpected slowdowns in demand for computers storage subsystems or consumer electronic devices generally result in sharp declines in demand for our products declines in consumer spending on the systems and devices that incorporate our products could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and on our financial condition and results of operations 

sales to the edge compute market remain an important part of our business this market however has been and we expect it to continue to be adversely affected by 

 

  

  

 we believe these announcements and introductions from time to time have caused consumers to defer or cancel their purchases making certain inventory obsolete whenever an oversupply of products in the market causes participants in our industry to have higher than anticipated inventory levels we experience even more intense price competition from other manufacturers than usual which may materially adversely affect our financial results we believe that the deterioration of demand for disk drives in the edge compute market has accelerated and this deterioration may continue or further accelerate which could cause our operating results to suffer 

in addition the demand for edge noncompute products is volatile this volatility may be exacerbated by competing alternative storage technologies such as flash memory which meet customers’ cost and capacity metrics unpredictable fluctuations in demand for our products or rapid shifts in demand from our products to alternative storage technologies in new edge noncompute applications could materially adversely impact our future results of operations 

the enterprise storage market for disk drives has been adversely affected by the growth of the utilization of nand flash memory in mission critical applications this deterioration of the enterprise storage disk drive market could cause our operating results to suffer an acceleration of the pace of migration of the enterprise storage market to nand flash memory products may materially adversely affect our financial results 

we are dependent on our longterm investments to manufacture adequate products our investment decisions in adding new assembly and test capacity require significant planning and leadtime and a failure to accurately forecast demand for our products could cause us to overinvest or underinvest which would lead to excess capacity underutilization charges impairments or loss of sales and revenue opportunities 

 

seagate technology public limited company  2019 form 10k  15 

our ability to increase our revenue and maintain our market share depends on our ability to successfully introduce and achieve market acceptance of new products on a timely basis  

the markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product introductions and technology enhancements uncertain product life cycles and changes in customer demand 

historically our results of operations have substantially depended upon our ability to be among the firsttomarket with new data storage product offerings we may face technological operational and financial challenges in developing new products in addition our investments in new product development may not yield the anticipated benefits our market share and results of operations in the future may be adversely affected if we fail to 

 

  

  

  

 accordingly we cannot accurately determine the ultimate effect that our new products will have on our results of operations our failure to accurately anticipate customers’ needs and accurately identify the shift in technological changes could materially adversely affect our longterm financial results 

in addition the limited number of highvolume oems magnifies the potential effect of missing a product qualification opportunity if the delivery of our products is delayed our oem customers may use our competitors’ products to meet their production requirements 

we cannot assure you that we will be among the leaders in timetomarket with new products or that we will be able to successfully qualify new products with our customers in the future if our new products are not successful our future results of operations may be adversely affected 

if our products do not keep pace with technological changes our results of operations will be adversely affected  

our customers demand new generations of storage products as advances in computer hardware and software have created the need for improved storage products with features such as increased storage capacity enhanced security improved performance and reliability and lower cost we and our competitors have developed improved products and we will need to continue to do so in the future if we are unable to develop new products identify business strategies and timely introduce competitive product offerings to meet technological shifts our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 

when we develop new products with higher capacity and more advanced technology our results of operations may decline because the increased difficulty and complexity associated with producing these products increases the likelihood of reliability quality or operability problems if our products experience increases in failure rates are of low quality or are not reliable customers may reduce their purchases of our products our factory utilization may decrease and our manufacturing rework and scrap costs and our service and warranty costs may increase in addition a decline in the reliability of our products may make it more difficult for us to effectively compete with our competitors 

additionally we may be unable to produce new products that have higher capacities and more advanced technologies in the volumes and timeframes that are required to meet customer demand we are transitioning to key areal density recording technologies that use hamr technology to increase hdd capacities if our transitions to more advanced technologies including the transition to hdds utilizing hamr technology require development and production cycles that are longer than anticipated or if we otherwise fail to implement new hdd technologies successfully we may lose sales and market share which could significantly harm our financial results 

 

seagate technology public limited company  2019 form 10k  16 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations and our investments to meet our liquidity requirements including servicing our indebtedness  

our business may not generate sufficient cash flows to enable us to meet our liquidity requirements including working capital capital expenditures product development efforts investments servicing our indebtedness and other general corporate requirements if we cannot fund our liquidity requirements we may have to reduce or delay capital expenditures product development efforts investments and other general corporate expenditures we cannot assure you that any of these remedies would if necessary be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all or that they would permit us to meet our obligations 

we are leveraged and require significant amounts of cash to service our debt our debt and debt service requirements could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities and reduce our options for capital allocation our high level of debt presents the following risks 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition in the event that we need to refinance all or a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures or incur additional debt to fund our operations we may not be able to obtain terms as favorable as the terms of our existing debt or refinance our existing debt at all if prevailing interest rates or other factors result in higher interest rates upon refinancing then the interest expense relating to the refinanced debt would increase furthermore if any rating agency changes our credit rating or outlook our debt and equity securities could be negatively affected which could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt or raise additional capital 

we may not be successful in our efforts to grow our eds and ssd revenues  

we have made and continue to make investments to grow our eds and ssd revenues our ability to grow eds and ssd revenues is subject to the following risks 

 

  

  

 our results of operations and share price may be adversely affected if we are not successful in our efforts to grow our revenues as anticipated in addition our growth in these markets may bring us into closer competition with some of our customers or potential customers which may decrease their willingness to do business with us 

 

seagate technology public limited company  2019 form 10k  17 

changes in the macroeconomic environment may in the future negatively impact our results of operations  

changes in macroeconomic conditions may affect consumer and enterprise spending and as a result our customers may postpone spending in response to volatility in credit and equity markets negative financial news andor declines in income or asset values all of which may have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products other factors that could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and on our financial condition and results of operations include conditions in the labor market healthcare costs access to credit consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior 

macroeconomic developments such as the pending withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union slowing economies in parts of asia and south america or increased tariffs between the us and china mexico and other countries could negatively affect our business operating results or financial condition which in turn could adversely affect the price of our ordinary shares a general weakening of and related declining corporate confidence in the global economy or the curtailment in government or corporate spending could cause current or potential customers to reduce their it budgets or be unable to fund data storage systems which could cause customers to delay decrease or cancel purchases of our products or cause customers not to pay us or to delay paying us for previously purchased products and services 

our quarterly results of operations fluctuate sometimes significantly from period to period and may cause our share price to decline  

our quarterly revenue and results of operations may fluctuate sometimes significantly from period to period these fluctuations which we expect to continue may be precipitated by a variety of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result we believe that quartertoquarter and yearoveryear comparisons of our revenue and results of operations may not be meaningful and that these comparisons may not be an accurate indicator of our future performance our results of operations in one or more future quarters may fail to meet the expectations of investment research analysts or investors which could cause an immediate and significant decline in our market value 

 

seagate technology public limited company  2019 form 10k  18 

we experience seasonal declines in the sales of our products during the second half of our fiscal year which may adversely affect our results of operations  

sales of computers storage subsystems and consumer electronic devices tend to be seasonal and therefore we expect to continue to experience seasonality in our business as we respond to variations in our customers’ demand for our products in particular we anticipate that sales of our products will continue to be lower during the second half of our fiscal year in the edge compute and edge noncompute market applications of our data storage business this seasonality is partially attributable to the historical trend of our customers’ increased sales of desktop computers notebook computers and consumer electronics during the backtoschool and winter holiday season in the enterprise storage market our sales are seasonal because of the capital budgeting and purchasing cycles of our end users we also experience seasonal reductions in the business activities of our customers during the summer months particularly in europe and the impact of international holidays like chinese new year typically result in lower earnings during those periods since our working capital needs peak during periods in which we are increasing production in anticipation of orders that have not yet been received our results of operations will fluctuate seasonally even if the forecasted demand for our products proves accurate furthermore it is difficult for us to evaluate the degree to which this seasonality may affect our business in future periods because of the rate and unpredictability of product transitions and new product introductions particularly in the edge noncompute market as well as macroeconomic conditions 

we have a long and unpredictable sales cycle for enterprise data storage solutions which impairs our ability to accurately predict our financial and operating results in any periods and may adversely affect our ability to forecast the need for investments and expenditures  

our enterprise data storage solutions are technically complex and we typically supply them in high quantities to a small number of customers many of our products are also tailored to meet the specific requirements of individual customers and are often integrated by our customers into the systems and products that they sell factors that affect the length of our sales cycle include 

 

  

  

 as a result our sales cycle for enterprise data storage solutions is often in excess of one year and frequently unpredictable given the length of development and unpredictability of the sales cycle we may be unable to accurately forecast product demand which may result in lost sales or excess inventory and associated inventory reserves or writedowns each of which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may be adversely affected by the loss of or reduced delayed or canceled purchases by one or more of our key customers  

some of our key customers account for a large portion of our revenue while we have longstanding relationships with many of our customers if any of our key customers were to significantly reduce their purchases from us our results of operations would be adversely affected although sales to key customers may vary from period to period a key customer that permanently discontinues or significantly reduces its relationship with us could be difficult to replace in line with industry practice new key customers usually require that we pass a lengthy and rigorous qualification process at the customer’s expense accordingly it may be difficult or costly for us to attract new key customers 

additionally if there is consolidation among our customer base our customers may be able to command increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale which could adversely affect our profitability furthermore if as a result of increased leverage customer pressures require us to reduce our pricing such that our gross margins are diminished it might not be feasible to sell our products to a particular customer which could result in a decrease in our revenue consolidation among our customer base may also lead to reduced demand for our products replacement of our products by the combined entity with those of our competitors and cancellations of orders each of which could adversely affect our operating results if a significant transaction involving any of our key customers results in the loss of or reduction in purchases by these key customers it could have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

seagate technology public limited company  2019 form 10k  19 

we are dependent on sales to distributors and retailers which may increase price erosion and the volatility of our sales  

a substantial portion of our sales has been to distributors of disk drive products certain of our distributors may also market other products that compete with our products product qualification programs in this distribution channel are limited which increases the number of competing products that are available to satisfy demand particularly in times of lengthening product cycles as a result purchasing decisions in this channel are based largely on price terms and product availability sales volumes through this channel are also less predictable and subject to greater volatility than sales to our oem customers in addition deterioration in business and economic conditions could exacerbate price erosion and volatility as distributors lower prices to compensate for lower demand and higher inventory levels our distributors’ ability to access credit for purposes of funding their operations may also affect purchases of our products by these customers if distributors reduce their purchases of our products or prices decline significantly in this distribution channel or if distributors experience financial difficulties or terminate their relationships with us our revenues and results of operations would be adversely affected 

in addition retail sales of our consumer solutions traditionally experience seasonal variability in demand with higher levels of demand in the first half of our fiscal year driven by consumer spending in the backtoschool season from late summer to fall and the traditional holiday shopping season from fall to winter our ability to reach such consumers depends on us maintaining effective working relationships with major retailers and distributors failure to anticipate consumer demand for our branded solutions as well as an inability to maintain effective working relationships with retail and online distributors may adversely impact our future results of operations 

our international sales and manufacturing operations subject us to risks that may adversely affect our business related to disruptions in foreign markets currency exchange fluctuations longer payment cycles potential adverse tax consequences increased costs our customers’ credit and access to capital healthrelated risks investment risks tariffs privacy and protection of data and access to personnel  

we have significant sales and manufacturing operations in foreign countries including manufacturing facilities sales personnel and customer support operations we have manufacturing facilities in china malaysia northern ireland singapore and thailand in addition to those in the united states additionally the manufacturing of some of our products is concentrated in certain geographical locations the production of certain drive subassemblies are limited to thailand and the production of media is limited to singapore disruptions in the economic environmental political legal or regulatory landscape in these countries may have a material adverse impact on our manufacturing operations 

our international operations are subject to economic risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries including the following

 our business is subject to various laws regulations and governmental policies that may cause us to incur significant expense  

our business is subject to regulation under a wide variety of us federal and state and nonus laws regulations and policies there can be no assurance that laws regulations and policies will not be changed in ways that will require us to modify our business model and objectives or affect our returns on investments by restricting existing activities and products subjecting them to escalating costs or prohibiting them outright in particular legislative regulatory or other areas of significance for our businesses that us and nonus governments have focused and continue to focus on include antitrust and competition law improper payments data privacy and sovereignty currency exchange controls that could restrict the movement of liquidity from particular jurisdictions trade controls or tariffs on imports and exports in the us or other countries complex economic sanctions and the enactment of us tax reform and potential further changes to tax laws may have an effect on our corporate structure operations sales liquidity capital requirements effective tax rate and performance in china malaysia northern ireland singapore and thailand in which we have significant operating assets and the european union have exercised and continue to exercise significant influence over many aspects of their domestic economies including but not limited to fair competition tax practices anticorruption antitrust price controls and international trade 

in addition regulation or government scrutiny may impact the requirements for marketing our products and slow our ability to introduce new products resulting in an adverse impact on our business although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate these or other applicable laws rules and regulations to which we may be subject violations of these laws and regulations could lead to significant penalties restraints on our export or import privileges monetary fines government investigations disruption of our operating activities damage to our reputation and corporate brand criminal proceedings and regulatory or other actions that could materially adversely affect our results of operations the political and media scrutiny surrounding a governmental investigation for the violation of such laws even if an investigation does not result in a finding of violation could cause us significant expense and collateral consequences including reputational harm that could have an adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

changes in us trade policy including the imposition of tariffs and the resulting consequences may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations  

the us government has adopted a new approach to trade policy including in some cases to renegotiate or potentially terminate certain existing bilateral or multilateral trade agreements the us government has also imposed tariffs on certain foreign goods including information and communication technology products these measures may materially increase costs for goods imported into the united states this in turn could require us to materially increase prices to our customers which may reduce demand or if we are unable to increase prices to adequately address any tariffs quotas or duties result in lowering our margin on products sold changes in us trade policy have resulted in and could result in more us trading partners adopting responsive trade policies including imposition of increased tariffs quotas or duties making it more difficult or costly for us to export our products to those countries the implementation of a border tax tariff or higher customs duties on our products manufactured abroad or components that we import into the us or any potential corresponding actions by other countries in which we do business could negatively impact our financial performance

we could suffer a loss of revenue and increased costs exposure to significant liability including legal and regulatory consequences reputational harm and other serious negative consequences if we encounter cyberattacks ransomware or other cyber security breaches that disrupt our operations or result in the dissemination of proprietary or confidential information about us or our customers or other third parties  

our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer equipment and the electronic data stored in our databases we manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our operations as our operations become more automated and increasingly interdependent our exposure to the risks posed by storage and maintenance of data will increase the measures we have implemented to secure our computer equipment and electronic data may be vulnerable to employee error hacking malfeasance system error or other irregularities and may not be sufficient for all eventualities the insurance coverage we maintain that is intended to address certain data security risks may be insufficient to cover all types of claims or losses that may arise we have been and will likely continue to be subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes cyberattacks or other computerrelated attempts to breach the information technology “it” systems we use for these purposes we may also be subject to it system failures and network disruptions due to these factors experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of thirdparties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products such attempts are increasing in technical sophistication number and ability to evade detection or to obscure such activities although we take steps to protect against and detect such attempts our efforts may not be sufficient for all eventualities in addition sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from thirdparties may contain defects in design or manufacture including “bugs” and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system 

the costs to us to eliminate or address the foregoing security problems and security vulnerabilities before or after a cyberincident could be significant system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions we could lose existing or potential customers for outsourcing services or other it solutions in connection with any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products some of our products contain encryption and other measures to protect thirdparty content stored on our products such measures may be compromised breached or circumvented by sophisticated attackers and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information may occur breaches of our security measures and the unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers or other thirdparties could expose us our vendors and customers or other thirdparties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation or governmental investigations and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business failure to meet our contractual obligations to promote information security with certain customers may result in liability including additional costs indemnification claims litigation and damage to our brand and reputation in addition we rely in certain limited capacities on thirdparty data management providers whose possible security problems and security vulnerabilities may have similar effects on us our business brand and reputation could also be adversely affected by media or other reports of perceived security vulnerabilities in our products network or processes even if unsubstantiated 

we are subject to laws rules and regulations in the us uk eu and other countries relating to the collection use and security of user data in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries and among us our subsidiaries and other parties with which we have commercial relations our ability to execute transactions and to possess and use personal information and data in conducting our business subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens that may require us to notify vendors customers or employees of a data security breach we have incurred and will continue to incur significant expenses to comply with mandatory privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law regulation industry standards or contractual obligations these laws protocols and standards continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices if we fail to comply with applicable federal state or international privacyrelated or data protection laws we may be subject to proceedings by governmental entities and incur penalties significant legal liability or reputational harm

we must successfully maintain and upgrade our it systems and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations  

from time to time we expand and improve our it systems to support our business going forward consequently we are in the process of implementing and will continue to invest in and implement modifications and upgrades to our it systems and procedures including making changes to legacy systems or acquiring new systems with new functionality and building new policies procedures training programs and monitoring tools these types of activities subject us to inherent costs and risks associated with changing and acquiring these systems including capital expenditures additional operating expenses demands on management time and other risks and costs of delays or difficulties in transitioning to or integrating new systems into our current systems these implementations modifications and upgrades may not result in productivity improvements at a level that outweighs the costs of implementation or at all in addition difficulties with implementing new technology systems delays in our timeline for planned improvements significant system failures or our inability to successfully modify our it systems to respond to changes in our business needs may cause disruptions in our business operations and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we experience shortages or delays in the receipt of or cost increases in critical components equipment or raw materials necessary to manufacture our products we may suffer lower operating margins production delays and other material adverse effects  

the cost quality and supply of components subassemblies certain equipment and raw materials used to manufacture our products and key components like recording media and heads are critical to our success the equipment we use to manufacture our products and components is frequently custom made and comes from a few suppliers and the lead times required to obtain manufacturing equipment can be significant particularly important for our products are components such as readwrite heads substrates for recording media asics spindle motors printed circuit boards suspension assemblies and nand flash memory 

we rely on sole suppliers or a limited number of suppliers for some or all of these components that we do not manufacture including substrates for recording media readwrite heads asics spindle motors printed circuit boards suspension assemblies and nand flash memory many of such component suppliers are geographically concentrated which makes our supply chain more vulnerable to regional disruptions such as severe weather acts of terrorism and an unpredictable geopolitical climate which may have a material impact on the production and availability of many components if our vendors for these components are unable to meet our cost quality and supply requirements continue to remain financially viable or fulfill their contractual commitments and obligations we could experience a shortage in supply or an increase in production costs which would materially adversely affect our results of operations 

certain rare earth elements are critical in the manufacture of our products we purchase components that contain rare earth elements from a number of countries including china we cannot predict whether any nation will impose regulations or trade barriers including tariffs duties quotas or embargoes upon the rare earth elements incorporated into our products that would restrict the worldwide supply of such metals or increase their cost we have experienced increased costs and production delays when we were unable to obtain the necessary equipment or sufficient quantities of some components andor have been forced to pay higher prices or make volume purchase commitments or advance deposits for some components equipment or raw materials that were in short supply in the industry in general further if our customers experience shortages of components or materials used in their products it could result in a decrease in demand for our products and have an adverse effect on our results of operations if any major supplier were to restrict the supply available to us or increase the cost of the rare earth elements used in our products we could experience a shortage in supply or an increase in production costs which would adversely affect our results of operations 

from time to time we may be subject to litigation government investigations or governmental proceedings which may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition  

from time to time we may be involved in various legal regulatory or administrative investigations negotiations or proceedings arising in the normal course of business in the event of litigation government investigations or governmental proceedings we are subject to the inherent risks and uncertainties that may result if outcomes differ from our expectations in the event of adverse outcomes in any litigation investigation or government proceeding we could be required to pay substantial damages fines or penalties and cease certain practices or activities which could materially harm our business 

 

seagate technology public limited company  2019 form 10k  24 

the costs associated with litigation and government investigations can also be unpredictable depending on the complexity and length of time devoted to such litigation or investigation litigation investigations or government proceedings may also divert the efforts and attention of our key personnel which could also harm our business 

if we do not control our fixed costs we will not be able to compete effectively in our industry  

we continually seek to make our cost structure and business processes more efficient we are focused on increasing workforce flexibility and scalability and improving overall competitiveness by leveraging our global capabilities as well as external talent and skills worldwide our strategy involves to a substantial degree increasing revenue and exabytes volume while at the same time controlling operating expenses if we do not control our operating expenses our ability to compete in the marketplace may be impaired in the past activities to reduce operating costs have included closures and transfers of facilities significant personnel reductions restructuring efforts and efforts to increase automation our restructuring efforts may not yield the intended benefits and may be unsuccessful or disruptive to our business operations which may materially adversely affect our financial results 

consolidation among component manufacturers has resulted and may continue to result in some component manufacturers exiting the industry or not making sufficient investments to develop new components  

if there is a shortage of or delay in supplying us with critical components equipment or raw materials then 

 

  

  

  

 we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain critical components in a timely and economic manner many of our suppliers’ manufacturing facilities are fully utilized if they fail to invest in capacity or in the required timeframe such failure would have an impact on our ability to ramp new products and may result in a loss of revenue or market share if our competitors did not utilize the same components and were not affected 

we often aim to lead the market in new technology deployments and leverage unique and customized technology from single source suppliers who are early adopters in the emerging market our options in supplier selection in these cases are limited and the supplier based technology may consequently be single sourced until wider adoption of the technology occurs and any necessary licenses become available in such cases any technical issues in the supplier’s technology may cause us to delay shipments of our new technology deployments and harm our financial position 

if revenues fall or customer demand decreases significantly we may not meet all of our purchase commitments to certain suppliers  

from time to time we enter into longterm noncancelable purchase commitments or make large upfront investments with certain suppliers in order to secure certain components or technologies for the production of our products or to supplement our internal manufacturing capacity for certain components if our actual revenues in the future are lower than our projections or if customer demand decreases significantly below our projections we may not meet all of our purchase commitments with these suppliers as a result it is possible that our revenues will not be sufficient to recoup our upfront investments in which case we will have to shift output from our internal manufacturing facilities to these suppliers or make penaltytype payments under the terms of these contracts additionally because our markets are volatile competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes we face inventory and other asset risks in the event we do not fully utilize firm purchase commitments

we are at times subject to intellectual property legal proceedings and claims which could cause us to incur significant additional costs or prevent us from selling our products and which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition  

we are subject from timetotime to legal proceedings and claims including claims of alleged infringement of the patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties by us or our customers in connection with their use of our products intellectual property litigation can be expensive and timeconsuming regardless of the merits of any claim and could divert our management’s attention from operating our business in addition intellectual property lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties due to the complexity of the technical issues involved which may cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations patent litigation has increased due to the current uncertainty of the law and the increasing competition and overlap of product functionality in the field some of the actions that we face from timetotime seek injunctions against the sale of our products andor substantial monetary damages which if granted or awarded could materially harm our business financial condition and operating results 

we cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of others we may not be aware of currently filed patent applications that relate to our products or technology if patents are later issued on these applications we may be liable for infringement if our products were found to infringe the intellectual property rights of others we could be required to pay substantial damages cease the manufacture use and sale of infringing products in one or more geographic locations expend significant resources to develop noninfringing technology discontinue the use of specific processes or obtain licenses to the technology infringed we might not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms or at all or be able to reengineer our products successfully to avoid infringement any of the foregoing could cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling our products which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary datanote 14 legal environmental and other contingencies ” contained in this report for a description of pending intellectual property proceedings

in addition our competitors may be able to design their products around our patents and other proprietary rights enforcement of our rights often requires litigation if we bring a patent infringement action and are not successful our competitors would be able to use similar technology to compete with us moreover the defendant in such an action may successfully counter sue us for infringement of their patents or assert a counterclaim that our patents are invalid or unenforceable 

furthermore we have significant operations and sales in foreign countries where intellectual property laws and enforcement policies are often less developed less stringent or more difficult to enforce than in the united states therefore we cannot be certain that we will be able to protect our intellectual property rights in jurisdictions outside the united states

 liquidity sources 

our primary sources of liquidity as of june 28 2019 consist of 1 approximately 22 billion in cash and cash equivalents 2 cash we expect to generate from operations and 3 15 billion available for borrowing from our 2019 revolving credit facility 

on february 20 2019 we terminated our senior unsecured revolving credit facility scheduled to expire on january 15 2020 under which we were able to draw up to 700 million upon termination we and our subsidiary seagate hdd cayman entered into the 2019 revolving credit facility which provides us with a 13 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility on may 28 2019 we increased our 2019 revolving credit facility from 13 billion to 15 billion the 2019 revolving credit facility also allows us to increase the facility by up to an aggregate of 100 million provided that i there has been and will be after giving effect to such increase no default ii the increase is at least 25 million and iii the existing commitments under the facility receive 050 most favored nation protection 

as of june 28 2019 no borrowings were drawn and no letters of credit or swing line loans had been utilized under the 2019 revolving credit facility

as of june 28 2019 cash and cash equivalents held by nonirish subsidiaries was 22 billion this amount is potentially subject to taxation in ireland upon repatriation by means of a dividend into our irish parent however it is our intent to indefinitely reinvest earnings of nonirish subsidiaries outside of ireland and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate such earnings by means of a taxable irish dividend should funds be needed in the irish parent company and should we be unable to fund parent company activities through means other than a taxable irish dividend we would be required to accrue and pay irish taxes on such dividend 

we believe that our sources of cash will be sufficient to fund our operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months 

cash requirements and commitments 

our liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital product development and capital expenditure needs to fund scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness and to fund our quarterly dividend and any future strategic investments our ability to fund these requirements will depend on our future cash flows which are determined by future operating performance and therefore subject to prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and financial business and other factors some of which are beyond our control 

on july 30 2019 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 063 per share which will be payable on october 9 2019 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on september 25 2019 

as of june 28 2019 we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our debt agreements based on our current outlook we expect to be in compliance with the covenants in our debt agreements over the next 12 months 

the carrying value of our debt as of june 28 2019 and june 29 2018 was 43 billion and 48 billion respectively the table below presents the principal amounts of our outstanding debt 

 

 from time to time we may repurchase any of our outstanding ordinary shares through private open market or broker assisted purchases tender offers or other means during fiscal year 2019 we repurchased approximately 22 million of our ordinary shares including shares withheld for statutory tax withholdings related to vesting of employee equity awards see “item 5 market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securitiesrepurchases of our equity securities” as of june 28 2019 22 billion remained available for repurchase under our existing repurchase authorization limit all repurchases are effected as redemptions in accordance with our articles of association 

for fiscal year 2020 we expect capital expenditures to be within our longterm targeted range of 6 to 8 of revenue we require substantial amounts of cash to fund any increased working capital requirements future capital expenditures scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness and payments of dividends we will continue to evaluate and manage the retirement and replacement of existing debt and associated obligations including evaluating the issuance of new debt securities exchanging existing debt securities for other debt securities and retiring debt pursuant to privately negotiated transactions open market purchases tender offers or other means or otherwise in addition we may selectively pursue strategic alliances acquisitions joint ventures and investments which may require additional capital

contractual obligations and commitments 

our contractual cash obligations and commitments as of june 28 2019 are summarized in the table below 

 

  

  

  

 as of june 28 2019 we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits and an accrual for the payment of related interest totaling 4 million none of which is expected to be settled within one year outside of one year we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlement with a taxing authority will occur 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of june 28 2019 we did not have any material offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of regulation sk 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the methods estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements the sec has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are highly uncertain at the time of estimation based on this definition our most critical accounting policies include revenue—sales program accruals warranty income taxes and assessing goodwill and other longlived assets for impairment below we discuss these policies further as well as the estimates and judgments involved we also have other accounting policies and accounting estimates relating to uncollectible customer accounts valuation of inventories valuation of sharebased payments and restructuring we believe that these other accounting policies and accounting estimates either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective or it is less likely that they would have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period 

revenue—sales program accruals  we record estimated variable consideration at the time of revenue recognition as a reduction to revenue variable consideration generally consists of sales incentive programs such as price protection and volume incentives aimed at increasing customer demand for oem sales rebates are typically established by estimating the most likely amount of consideration expected to be received based on an oem customer’s volume of purchases from us or other agreed upon rebate programs for the distribution and retail channel these sales incentive programs typically involve 

 

seagate technology public limited company  2019 form 10k  45 

estimating the most likely amount of rebates related to a customer’s level of sales order size advertising or point of sale activity as well as the expected value of price protection adjustments based on historical analysis and forecasted pricing environment in fiscal years 2019 2018 and 2017 total sales programs were approximately 11 of gross revenue adjustments to revenues due to under or over accruals for sales programs related to revenues reported in prior quarterly periods were less than 1 of gross revenue in fiscal years 2019 2018 and 2017 

warranty we estimate probable product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized we generally provide a warranty on our products for a period of 1 to 5 years our warranty provision considers estimated product failure rates and trends including the timing of product returns during the warranty periods and estimated repair or replacement costs related to product quality issues if any we also exercise judgment in estimating our ability to sell refurbished products our judgment is subject to a greater degree of subjectivity with respect to newly introduced products because of limited experience with those products upon which to base our warranty estimates 

income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits recognition of income and deductions and calculation of specific tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for income tax and financial statement purposes as well as tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions the calculation of tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the internal revenue service or other tax jurisdictions if estimates of these tax liabilities are greater or less than actual results an additional tax provision or benefit will result the deferred tax assets we record each period depend primarily on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states and certain nonus jurisdictions each period we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and if necessary adjust the valuation allowance so that net deferred tax assets are recorded only to the extent we conclude it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized if our outlook for future taxable income changes significantly our assessment of the need for and the amount of a valuation allowance may also change 

assessing goodwill and other longlived assets for impairment we perform a qualitative assessment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist to determine if any events or circumstances exist such as an adverse change in business climate or a decline in the overall industry that would indicate that it would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount based on the qualitative assessment if it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then the company is not required to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test if it is determined in the qualitative assessment that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not below its carrying amount including goodwill then we perform a quantitative impairment test the quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount any excess in the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill over its fair value is recognized as an impairment loss limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 

we evaluate other longlived assets including property equipment and leasehold improvements and other intangible assets subject to amortization for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of those assets may not be recoverable we assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group if the recoverability assessment indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable we will estimate the fair value of the asset group and compare it to its carrying value the excess of the carrying value over the fair value is allocated pro rata to derive the adjusted carrying value of each asset in the asset group the adjusted carrying value of each asset in the asset group is not reduced below its fair value

industry overview 

data storage industry 

the data storage industry is comprised of companies that manufacture components or subcomponents designed for data storage devices and companies that provide storage solutions software and services for enterprise cloud big data computing platforms and consumer markets we believe the proliferation and personal creation of mediarich digital content will continue to create increasing consumer demand for higher capacity storage solutions 

markets 

the principal markets served by us include 

enterprise storage we define enterprise storage as dedicated storage area networks and hyperscale cloud storage environments enterprise and cloud data centers run solutions which are designed for mission critical nearline and enterprise serial attached scsi ssds applications 

mission critical applications are defined as those that are vital to the operation of largescale enterprise workloads requiring high performance and high reliability storage solutions we expect the market for mission critical enterprise storage solutions to continue to be driven by enterprises utilizing dedicated storage area networks our storage solutions are comprised principally of high performance enterprise class disk drives with sophisticated firmware and communications technologies 

nearline applications are defined as those which require high capacity and energy efficient storage solutions we expect such applications which include storage for cloud computing content delivery and backup services will continue to grow and drive demand for solutions designed with these attributes with the increased requirements for storage capacity and performance driven by the creation and consumption of mediarich digital content we expect the increased exabyte demand will require further buildout of data centers by cloud service providers “csps” and other enterprises which utilize high capacity nearline devices 

enterprise sas ssds are designed to deliver superior performance reliability and enterprise features to meet the demands of iointensive applications with potential for substantial power savings nvme ssds and addin cards are designed to optimize enterprise applications with a persistent highperformance highcapacity memory design they also leverage flash and software to accelerate any server virtualized deployment and move any big data to the realm of real time 

 

seagate technology public limited company  2018 form 10k  3 

edge computeclient compute we define edge computeclient compute applications as solutions designed for desktop and mobile compute applications ranging from traditional laptops to convertible systems as storage of digital content in the cloud becomes more prevalent accessible and affordable some edge computeclient compute applications rely less on builtin storage and instead have transitioned to cloud storage and computing solutions along with branded external hard drives 

edge noncomputeclient noncompute we define edge noncomputeclient noncompute applications as solutions designed for consumer electronic devices and disk drives used for external storage disk drives designed for consumer electronic devices are primarily used in applications such as surveillance systems dvrs nas and gaming consoles that require a higher capacity low costpergigabyte storage solution disk drives for external storage are designed for purposes such as portable external storage and to augment storage capacity in the consumer’s current desktop notebook tablet or mobile phone devices 

cloud systems and solutions we define cloud systems and solutions as applications that provide solutions to businesses for the purpose of modular systems and scaleout storage solutions systems can contain hdds and ssds and may offer file management systems software and compute power 

participants in the data storage industry include 

major subcomponent manufacturers companies that manufacture components or subcomponents used in data storage devices or solutions include companies that supply spindle motors heads and media and application specific integrated circuits “asics” 

storage solutions manufacturers companies that transform components into storage products include disk drive manufacturers and semiconductor storage manufacturers which integrate flash memory into storage products such as ssds 

system integrators companies such as oems that bundle and package storage solutions distributors that integrate storage hardware and software into enduser applications and csps that provide cloud based solutions to businesses for the purpose of scaleout storage solutions and modular systems 

hyperscale data centers large hyperscale data center companies which are increasingly designing their own storage subsystems and having them built by contract manufacturers for use inside their own data centers this trend is reshaping the storage system and subsystem market and driving innovation in system design and changes in the competitive landscape of large storage system vendors 

storage services companies that provide and host services and solutions which include storage backup archiving recovery and discovery of data 

demand for data storage 

the international data corporation “idc” forecasted in its 2017 data age 2025 study that the global datasphere will grow to 163 zettabytes by 2025 according to idc we are fast approaching a new era of the data age which we expect will have a positive impact on storage demand we believe that the continued advancement of the cloud the further development of edge computing the global proliferation of mobile devices the evolution of the internet of things “iot” the increasing use of video surveillance the evolution of consumer electronic devices and the enterprise use of big data analytics are driving the growth of digital content factors contributing to the growth of digital content include 

 

  

  

  

seagate technology public limited company  2018 form 10k  4 

  

  

 as a result of these factors we anticipate that the nature and volume of content being created will require greater storage which is more efficiently and economically facilitated by higher capacity storage devices in order to store manage distribute analyze and backup such content we expect this to support the growth in demand for data storage solutions in developed and emerging economies 

in addition the economics of storage infrastructure are also evolving with the utilization of public and private hyperscale storage and opensource solutions reducing the total cost of ownership of storage while increasing the speed and efficiency with which customers can leverage massive computing and storage devices accordingly we expect these trends will continue to create significant demand for data storage solutions going forward 

demand trends 

we believe that continued growth in digital content requires increasingly higher storage capacity in order to store aggregate host distribute analyze manage protect backup and use such content we also believe that as architectures evolve to serve the growing commercial and consumer user base throughout the world the storage solutions will evolve as well 

we expect increased data creation will lead to the expansion of the need for storage in the form of both hdds and ssds while the advance of solid state technology in many end markets is expected to increase we believe that in the foreseeable future cloud traditional enterprise client and consumer markets that require highcapacity storage solutions will be best served by hard disk drives due to their ability to deliver the most cost effective reliable and energy efficient mass storage devices we also believe that as hard disk drive capacities continue to increase a focus exclusively on unit demand does not reflect the increase in demand for exabytes this has resulted in demand for fewer units but with higher average capacity per drive 

industry supply balance 

from time to time the storage industry has experienced periods of imbalance between supply and demand to the extent that the storage industry builds or maintains capacity based on expectations of demand that do not materialize price erosion may become more pronounced conversely during periods where demand exceeds supply price erosion is generally muted 

our business 

disk drive technology 

the design and manufacturing of disk drives depends on highly advanced technology and manufacturing techniques and therefore requires high levels of research and development spending and capital equipment investments we design fabricate and assemble a number of the most important components in our disk drives including readwrite heads and recording media our design and manufacturing operations are based on technology platforms that are used to produce various disk drive products that serve multiple data storage applications and markets our core technology platforms are focused around the areal density of media and readwrite head technologies this design and manufacturing approach allows us to deliver a portfolio of disk drive products to service a wide range of data storage applications and industries 

disk drives that we manufacture are commonly differentiated by the following key characteristics 

 

  

  

seagate technology public limited company  2018 form 10k  5 

  

  

  

  

  

 areal density is measured by storage capacity per square inch on the recording surface of a disk the storage capacity of a disk drive is determined by the number of disks it contains as well as the areal density capability of these disks we have been pursuing and will continue to pursue a number of technologies to increase areal densities across the entire range of our products for expanding disk drive capacities and reducing the number of disks and heads per drive to further reduce product costs 

manufacturing 

we design and produce our own readwrite heads and recording media which are critical technologies for disk drives this integrated approach enables us to lower costs and to improve the functionality of components so that they work together efficiently 

we believe that because of our vertical design and manufacturing strategy we are well suited to take advantage of the opportunities to leverage the close interdependence of components for disk drives our manufacturing efficiency and flexibility are critical elements of our integrated business strategy we continuously seek to improve our manufacturing efficiency and reduce manufacturing costs by 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 a vertically integrated model however tends to have less flexibility when demand moderates as it exposes us to higher unit costs when capacity utilization is not optimized 

components and raw materials 

disk drives incorporate certain components including a head disk assembly and a printed circuit board mounted to the head disk assembly which are sealed inside a rigid base and top cover containing the recording components in a contamination controlled environment we maintain a highly integrated approach to our business by designing and manufacturing a significant portion of the components we view as critical to our products such as readwrite heads and recording media 

readwrite heads the function of the readwrite head is to scan across the disk as it spins magnetically recording or reading information the tolerances of readwrite heads are extremely demanding and require stateoftheart equipment and 

 

seagate technology public limited company  2018 form 10k  6 

processes our readwrite heads are manufactured with thinfilm and photolithographic processes similar to those used to produce semiconductor integrated circuits though challenges related to magnetic film properties and topographical structures are unique to the disk drive industry we perform all primary stages of design and manufacture of readwrite heads at our facilities we use a combination of internally manufactured and externally sourced readwrite heads the mix of which varies based on product mix technology and our internal capacity levels 

media data is written to or read from the media or disk as it rotates at very high speeds past the readwrite head the media is made from nonmagnetic substrates usually an aluminum alloy or glass and is coated with thin layers of magnetic materials we use a combination of internally manufactured and externally sourced finished media and aluminum substrates the mix of which varies based on product mix technology and our internal capacity levels we purchase all of our glass substrates from third parties 

printed circuit board assemblies the printed circuit board assemblies “pcbas” are comprised of standard and custom asics and ancillary electronic control chips the asics control the movement of data to and from the readwrite heads and through the internal controller and interface which communicates with the host computer the asics and control chips form electronic circuitry that delivers instructions to a head positioning mechanism called an actuator to guide the heads to the selected track of a disk where the data is recorded or retrieved disk drive manufacturers use one or more industry standard interfaces such as serial advanced technology architecture “sata” small computer system interface “scsi” sas or fiber channel to communicate to the host systems we outsource to third parties the manufacture and assembly of the pcbas used in our disk drives we do not manufacture any asics but we participate in their design 

head disk assembly the head disk assembly consists of one or more disks attached to a spindle assembly powered by a spindle motor that rotates the disks at a high constant speed around a hub readwrite heads mounted on an arm assembly similar in concept to that of a record player fly extremely close to each disk surface and record data on and retrieve it from concentric tracks in the magnetic layers of the rotating disks the readwrite heads are mounted vertically on an eshaped assembly “eblock” that is actuated by a voicecoil motor to allow the heads to move from track to track the eblock and the recording media are mounted inside the head disk assembly we purchase spindle motors from outside vendors and from time to time participate in the design of the motors that go into our products 

disk drive assembly following the completion of the head disk assembly it is mated to the pcba and the completed unit goes through extensive defect mapping and machine learning prior to packaging and shipment disk drive assembly and machine learning operations occur primarily at our facilities located in china and thailand we perform subassembly and component manufacturing operations at our facilities in china malaysia northern ireland singapore thailand and the united states in addition third parties manufacture and assemble components for us in various countries worldwide 

suppliers of components and industry constraints there are a limited number of independent suppliers of components such as recording heads and media available to disk drive manufacturers vertically integrated disk drive manufacturers who manufacture their own components are less dependent on external component suppliers than less vertically integrated disk drive manufacturers however our business has been adversely affected by our suppliers’ capacity constraints in the past and this could occur again 

commodity and other manufacturing costs the production of disk drives requires rare earth elements precious metals scarce alloys and industrial commodities which are subject to fluctuations in price and the supply of which has at times been constrained in addition to increased costs of components and commodities volatility in fuel costs may also increase our costs related to commodities manufacturing and freight as a result we may increase our use of alternative shipment methods to help offset any increase in freight costs and will continually review various forms of shipments and routes in order to minimize the exposure to higher freight costs 

products

the following table summarizes our hdd revenue by channel and by geography 

 

  

 

 oem customers including cloud service providers typically enter into master purchase agreements with us these agreements provide for pricing volume discounts order lead times product support obligations and other terms and conditions including sales programs offered to promote selected products deliveries are scheduled only after receipt of purchase orders in addition with limited leadtime customers may defer most purchase orders without significant penalty anticipated orders from many of our customers have in the past failed to materialize or oem delivery schedules have been deferred or altered as a result of changes in their business needs 

our distributors generally enter into nonexclusive agreements for the resale of our products they typically furnish us with a nonbinding indication of their nearterm requirements and product deliveries are generally scheduled accordingly the agreements and related sales programs typically provide the distributors with limited rights of return and price protection rights in addition we offer sales programs to distributors on a quarterly and periodic basis to promote the sale of selected products in the sales channel 

our retail channel consists of our branded storage products sold to retailers either by us directly or by our distributors retail sales made by us or our distributors typically require greater marketing support sales incentives and price protection periods 

in fiscal year 2018 no customer accounted for more than 10 of consolidated revenue in fiscal years 2017 and 2016 dell inc accounted for approximately 10 and 12 of consolidated revenue respectively see “item 1a risk factorsrisks related to our businesswe may be adversely affected by the loss of or reduced delayed or canceled purchases by one or more of our key customers” 

competition 

we compete primarily with manufacturers of hard drives used in the enterprise edge computeclient compute and edge noncomputeclient noncompute applications and with other companies in the data storage industry that provide ssds and nvme addin technology some of the principal factors used by customers to differentiate among data storage solutions manufacturers are storage capacity product performance product quality and reliability price per unit and price per gigabyte storageretrieval access times data transfer rates form factor product warranty and support capabilities supply continuity and flexibility power consumption total cost of ownership and brand while different markets and customers place varying levels of emphasis on these factors we believe that our products are competitive with respect to many of these factors in the markets that we currently address 

principal competitors we compete with manufacturers of storage solutions and the principal manufactures in the data storage solution industry include

 price erosion historically our industry has been characterized by price declines for disk drive products with comparable capacity performance and feature sets “likeforlike products” price declines for likeforlike products “price erosion” tend to be more pronounced during periods of 

 

  

  

 disk drive manufacturers typically attempt to offset price erosion with an improved mix of disk drive products characterized by higher capacity better performance and additional feature sets and product cost reductions 

we believe the hdd industry experienced modest price erosion in fiscal years 2016 2017 and 2018 

product life cycles and changing technology success in our industry has been dependent to a large extent on the ability to balance the introduction and transition of new products with timetovolume performance capacity and quality metrics at a competitive price level of service and support that our customers expect generally the drive manufacturer that introduces a new product first benefits from improved product mix favorable profit margins and less pricing pressure until comparable products are introduced changing technology also necessitates ongoing investments in research and development which may be difficult to recover due to rapid product life cycles and economic declines further there is a continued need to successfully execute product transitions and new product introductions as factors such as quality reliability and manufacturing yields continue to be of significant competitive importance 

seasonality 

the disk drive industry traditionally experiences seasonal variability in demand with higher levels of demand in the second half of the calendar year this seasonality is driven by consumer spending in the backtoschool season from late summer to fall and the traditional holiday shopping season from fall to winter beyond traditional seasonality variability of sales can be related to it spending or a reflection of more cyclical demand from csps based on the timing of procurement deployment and market supply and demand balance of other components such as nand and dram 

research and development 

we are committed to developing new component technologies products and alternative storage technologies our research and development focus is designed to bring new products to market in high volume with quality attributes that our customers expect before our competitors part of our product development strategy is to leverage a design platform andor subsystem within product families to serve different market needs this platform strategy allows for more efficient resource utilization leverages best design practices reduces exposure to changes in demand and allows for achievement of lower costs through purchasing economies our advanced technology integration effort focuses disk drive and component research on recording subsystems including readwrite heads and recording media marketspecific product technology and technology focused towards new business opportunities the primary purpose of our advanced technology integration effort is to ensure timely availability of mature component technologies for our product development teams as well as to allow us to leverage and coordinate those technologies in the design centers across our products in order to take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace during fiscal years 2018 2017 and 2016 we had product development expenses of approximately 1026 million 1232 million and 1237 million respectively which represented 9 11 and 11 of our consolidated revenue respectively

patents and licenses 

as of june 29 2018 we had approximately 6000 us patents and 1400 patents issued in various foreign jurisdictions as well as approximately 1000 us and 600 foreign patent applications pending the number of patents and patent applications will vary at any given time as part of our ongoing patent portfolio management activity due to the rapid technological change that characterizes the data storage industry we believe that in addition to patent protection the improvement of existing products reliance upon trade secrets protection of unpatented proprietary knowhow and development of new products are also important to our business in establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage accordingly we intend to continue our efforts to broadly protect our intellectual property including obtaining patents where available in connection with our research and development program 

the data storage industry is characterized by significant litigation arising from time to time relating to patent and other intellectual property rights from time to time we receive claims that our products infringe patents of third parties although we have been able to resolve some of those claims or potential claims without a material adverse effect on us other claims have resulted in adverse decisions or settlements in addition other claims are pending which if resolved unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations for more information on these claims see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data—note 14 legal environmental and other contingencies” the costs of engaging in intellectual property litigation in the past have been and in the future may be substantial irrespective of the merits of the claim or the outcome 

backlog 

in view of industry practice whereby customers may cancel or defer orders with little or no penalty we believe backlog for our business is of limited indicative value in estimating future performance and results

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to us and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites some of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution and these permits are subject to modification renewal and revocation by issuing authorities 

we have established environmental management systems and continually update environmental policies and standard operating procedures for our operations worldwide we believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws regulations and permits we budget for operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental laws if additional or more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future we could incur additional operating costs and capital expenditures 

some environmental laws such as the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended the “superfund” law and its state equivalents can impose liability for the cost of cleanup of contaminated sites upon any of the current or former site owners or operators or upon parties who sent waste to these sites regardless of whether the owner or operator owned the site at the time of the release of hazardous substances or the lawfulness of the original disposal activity we have been identified as a responsible or potentially responsible party at several sites at each of these sites we have an assigned portion of the financial liability based on the type and amount of hazardous substances disposed of by each party at the site and the number of financially viable parties we have fulfilled our responsibilities at some of these sites and remain involved in only a few at this time 

while our ultimate costs in connection with these sites are difficult to predict based on current estimates of cleanup costs and our expected allocation of these costs we do not expect costs in connection with these sites to be material 

we may be subject to various state federal and international laws and regulations governing environmental matters including those restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products for example the european union “eu” has enacted the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment which prohibits the use of certain substances including lead in certain products including disk drives and server storage products 

 

seagate technology public limited company  2018 form 10k  11 

put on the market after july 1 2006 similar legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions including in the united states canada mexico taiwan china japan and others the european union reach directive registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals ec 19072006 also restricts substances of very high concern “svhcs” in products 

employees 

at june 29 2018 we employed approximately 43000 employees and temporary employees worldwide of which approximately 36000 were located in our asian operations we believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees at all levels we believe that our employee relations are good

 item 1a risk factors 

tableend our industry is highly competitive and our failure to anticipate and respond to technological and market developments could harm our ability to compete 

we operate in markets that are highly competitive and subject to rapid change and that are significantly affected by new product introductions and technological advancements our competitors also may aggressively lower prices as part of a strategy to gain or retain market share and customers if these practices continue we may need to continually reduce our prices for existing products to retain our market share which could adversely affect our results of operations 

our ability to offset the effect of price erosion through new product introductions at higher average prices may be diminished to the extent competitors introduce products before we introduce similar competing products we may also lose market share if we are unable to ramp volume production of new products as quickly as our competitors ramp production of similar competing products any significant decline in our market share in any of our principal market applications would adversely affect our results of operations 

our principal sources of competition include 

 

  

  

  

 we also experience competition from other companies that produce alternative storage technologies such as flash memory where increasing capacity decreasing cost energy efficiency and improvements in performance ruggedness have resulted in competition with our lower capacity smaller form factor disk drives this competition has traditionally been in the markets for handheld consumer electronics applications and now it also includes ssds for tablet notebook and enterprise compute applications some customers for both enterprise and edge compute applications are adopting ssds as alternatives to hard drives in certain applications further adoption of these alternative storage technologies may impact the competitiveness of our product portfolio and reduce our market share and adversely affect our results of operations 

the markets for our data storage system products are also characterized by technological change which is driven in part by the adoption of new industry standards these standards provide mechanisms to ensure technology component interoperability can occur and may reduce our capability for differentiation or innovation if this occurs our affected products may be considered commodities this could lower the barriers for entry to our market away from our specialized research and development skills and enable entry for the generalpurpose design skills found in some large ems and cem companies commodity markets are driven by extremely low margins and very aggressive competitive pricing if our market becomes more commoditized and we fail to deliver innovative valueadded alternatives to our customers or if our component manufacturers transfer their business to our competitors we will have difficulty competing against the larger ems and cem companies which could reduce our profit margin or result in a loss of market share which could significantly harm our financial condition 

we may be unable to effectively plan and make strategic changes in our business which may materially adversely affect our financial and business results additionally even if we are able to make desired strategic changes we may not achieve the intended benefits of our efforts 

if we fail to predict demand accurately for our products in any quarter or if the market for our products changes we may not be able to recapture the cost of our investments which may materially adversely affect our financial results and results of operations 

our industry operates primarily on quarterly purchasing cycles with much of the order flow in any given quarter typically coming at the end of that quarter our quarterly results are subject to substantial fluctuations and can be difficult to predict our 

 

seagate technology public limited company  2018 form 10k  14 

manufacturing process requires us to make significant productspecific investments in inventory in each quarter for production in that quarter and future quarters since we typically receive the bulk of our orders late in a quarter after we have made our investments there is a risk that our orders will not be sufficient to allow us to recapture the costs of our investment before the products resulting from that investment have become obsolete we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to accurately predict demand in the future 

our revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent upon customer orders in that quarter we attempt to project future orders based in part on estimates from our key customers our customers’ estimated requirements are not always accurate and therefore we cannot predict our quarterly revenues with any degree of certainty in addition we derive a portion of our revenues in each quarter from a number of relatively large orders if one or more of our key customers decides to defer a purchase order or delays product acceptance in any given quarter our revenues for that quarter may be significantly reduced and fall below our expectations 

the difficulty in forecasting demand also increases the difficulty in anticipating our inventory requirements which may cause us to overproduce or underproduce finished goods if we do not produce enough finished goods to meet customer requirements we may be unable to maintain our market share additionally the risk of obsolescence or lower of cost and net realizable value inventory writeoffs could increase if we were to carry excess inventory levels for extended periods or due to volatility in the pricing environment our uneven sales cycle makes inventory management challenging and future financial results less predictable we cannot be certain that we will be able to recover the costs associated with increased inventory 

other factors that may adversely affect our ability to recapture the cost of investments in any given quarter include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition the demand for edge noncomputeclient noncompute products can be even more volatile and unpredictable than the demand for edge computeclient compute products in some cases our products manufactured for edge noncomputeclient noncompute applications are uniquely configured for a single customer’s application which creates a risk of unwanted and unsellable inventory if the anticipated volumes are not realized this potential for unpredictable volatility is increased by the possibility of competing alternative storage technologies such as flash memory meeting the customers’ cost and capacity metrics resulting in a rapid shift in demand from our products and disk drive technology generally to alternative storage technologies unpredictable fluctuations in demand for our products or rapid shifts in demand from our products to alternative storage technologies in new edge noncomputeclient noncompute applications could materially adversely impact 

 

seagate technology public limited company  2018 form 10k  15 

our future results of operations additionally we are dependent on our longterm investment to manufacture adequate products our investment decisions in adding a new assembly and test capacity require significant planning and leadtime and a failure to accurately forecast demand for our products could cause us to overinvest or underinvest which would lead to excess capacity underutilization charges impairments or loss of sales and revenue opportunities 

market acceptance of new product introductions cannot be accurately predicted and our results of operations will suffer if there is less demand for our new products than is anticipated 

the markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product introductions and technology enhancements uncertain product life cycles and changes in customer demand the success of our new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors including market acceptance our ability to manage the risks associated with product transitions our ability to effectively manage inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand and the risk that our new products will have quality problems or other defects in the early stages of introduction that were not anticipated in the design of those products accordingly we cannot accurately determine the ultimate effect that our new products will have on our results of operations our failure to accurately anticipate customers’ needs and accurately identify the shift in technological changes could materially adversely affect our longterm financial results 

historically our results of operations have substantially depended upon our ability to be among the firsttomarket with new disk drive product offerings we may face technological operational and financial challenges in developing new products in addition our investments in new product development may not yield the anticipated benefits our market share and results of operations in the future may be adversely affected if we fail to 

 

  

  

  

 in addition the success of our new product introductions is dependent upon our ability to qualify as a primary source of supply with our oem customers in order for our products to be considered by our customers for qualification we must be among the leaders in timetomarket with those new products once a product is accepted any failure or delay in the qualification process or a requirement that we requalify can result in our losing sales to that customer until new products are introduced the limited number of highvolume oems magnifies the potential effect of missing a product qualification opportunity these risks are further magnified because we expect competitive pressures to result in declining sales eroding prices and declining gross margins on our current generation products if the delivery of our products is delayed our oem customers may use our competitors’ products to meet their production requirements we cannot assure you that we will be among the leaders in timetomarket with new products or that we will be able to successfully qualify new products with our customers in the future 

we face the related risk that consumers and businesses may wait to make their purchases to evaluate new products or if they want to buy a new product that has been announced but not yet released if this were to occur we may be unable to sell our existing inventory of products that may be less efficient and cost effective compared to new products as a result even if we are among the firsttomarket with a given product subsequent introductions or announcements by our competitors of new products could cause us to lose revenue and not achieve a positive return on our investment in existing products and inventory 

if we cannot successfully deliver competitive products our future results of operations may be adversely affected further due to market competition volatility and rapid technology and price changes we may be unable to accurately forecast demand resulting in insufficient or excess production or purchase of products or components inventory any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

we may not be able to identify suitable strategic alliances acquisitions joint ventures or investment opportunities to successfully acquire and integrate companies that provide complementary products or technologies or to realize the anticipated benefits of such transactions 

our longterm growth strategy involves pursuing strategic alliances with making acquisitions of forming joint ventures with or making investments in other companies that are complementary to our business there is substantial competition for 

 

seagate technology public limited company  2018 form 10k  16 

attractive strategic alliance acquisition joint venture and investment candidates additionally a trend of consolidation in the data storage industry could materially adversely affect our business and financial results and our future growth prospects accordingly we may not be able to identify suitable strategic alliances acquisition joint venture or investment candidates even if we can identify them the terms on which we are able to consummate a transaction may not be commercially reasonable for us to pursue we cannot assure you that we will be able to partner with acquire or invest in suitable candidates or integrate acquired technologies or operations successfully into our existing technologies and operations moreover our ability to finance potential strategic alliances acquisitions joint ventures or investments may be limited by our leverage level the covenants contained in the instruments that govern our outstanding indebtedness and any agreements governing any other debt we may incur in addition our cash reserves could diminish significantly as a result of any acquisitions joint ventures strategic alliances or other investments we pursue 

even if we are successful in forming strategic alliances or acquiring forming joint ventures with or making investments in other companies these transactions may have an adverse effect on our results of operations particularly while the operations of an acquired business are being integrated it is also likely that integration of acquired companies would lead to the loss of key employees from those companies or the loss of customers of those companies in addition the integration of any acquired companies would require substantial attention from our senior management which may limit the amount of time available to be devoted to our daytoday operations or to the execution of our strategy growth by strategic alliance acquisition joint venture or investment involves an even higher degree of risk to the extent we combine new product offerings and enter new markets in which we have limited experience and no assurance can be given that acquisitions of entities with new or alternative business models will be successfully integrated or achieve the desired objectives there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits or synergies of any strategic alliance acquisition joint venture or investment that we make or if we do how long it will take to achieve such benefits 

furthermore the expansion of our business involves the risk that we may not manage our growth effectively that we would incur additional debt to finance these acquisitions or investments that would increase our debt service obligations and that we may have impairment of goodwill or acquired intangible assets associated with these acquisitions and investments each of these items could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we could issue additional ordinary shares in connection with future strategic alliances acquisitions joint ventures or investments issuing shares in connection with such transactions would have the effect of diluting the ownership percentage of the outstanding ordinary shares and could cause the price of our ordinary shares to decline and impact our existing dividend policy or share repurchase program resulting in diminishing shareholders’ value 

if we do not develop products in time to keep pace with technological changes our results of operations will be adversely affected 

our customers demand new generations of storage products as advances in computer hardware and software have created the need for improved storage products with features such as increased storage capacity enhanced security improved performance and reliability and lower cost we and our competitors have developed improved products and we will need to continue to do so in the future such product development requires significant investments in research and development we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully complete the design or introduction of new products in a timely manner that we will be able to manufacture new products in sufficient volumes with acceptable manufacturing yields that we will be able to successfully market these new products or that these products will perform to specifications on a longterm basis in addition the impact of slowing areal density growth may adversely impact our ability to be successful 

when we develop new products with higher capacity and more advanced technology our results of operations may decline because the increased difficulty and complexity associated with producing these products increases the likelihood of reliability quality or operability problems if our products experience increases in failures rates are of low quality or are not reliable customers may reduce their purchases of our products our factory utilization may decrease and our manufacturing rework and scrap costs and our service and warranty costs may increase in addition a decline in the reliability of our products may make us less competitive 

additionally we may be unable to produce new products that have higher capacities and more advanced technologies in the volumes and timeframes that are required to meet customer demand we announced our future transition to key areal density recording technologies that will use heatedassisted magnetic reading “hamr” technology to increase hdd 

 

seagate technology public limited company  2018 form 10k  17 

capacities if our transitions to more advanced technologies including the transition to hdds utilizing hamr technology require development and production cycles that are longer than anticipated or if we otherwise fail to implement new hdd technologies successfully we may lose sales and market share which could significantly harm our financial condition 

we may fail to successfully anticipate technological shifts business opportunities and market demand we also may be subject to risks associated with entry into the nand flash memory market if we are unable to successfully to penetrate the nand flash memory market our future growth prospects may be materially adversely affected we may fail to develop new products identify business strategies and introduce competitive product offerings to meet those technological shifts which may materially adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and may impact our future financial results 

servicing our indebtedness requires a significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt 

we are leveraged and have significant debt service obligations our significant debt and debt service requirements could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities and reduce our options for capital allocation our high level of debt presents the following risks 

 

  

  

  

  

 our business may not generate cash flow in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay the principal of or interest on our indebtedness further in the event that we need to refinance all or a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures or incur additional debt to fund our operations we may not be able to obtain terms as favorable as the terms of our existing debt or refinance our existing debt at all if prevailing interest rates or other factors result in higher interest rates upon refinancing then the interest expense relating to the refinanced debt would increase furthermore if any rating agency changes our credit rating or outlook our debt and equity securities could be negatively affected which could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt or raise additional capital 

in addition our business may not generate cash flow in an amount sufficient to enable us to fund our other liquidity needs including working capital capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements if we cannot fund our liquidity needs we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements we cannot assure you that any of these remedies could if necessary be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all or that they would permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations in addition if we incur additional debt the risks associated with our substantial leverage including the risk that we will be unable to service our debt or generate enough cash flow to fund our liquidity needs could intensify 

changes in demand for computer systems and storage subsystems may in the future cause a decline in demand for our products 

our products are components in computers data storage systems and consumer electronics devices historically the demand for these products has been volatile unexpected slowdowns in demand for computer systems storage subsystems 

 

seagate technology public limited company  2018 form 10k  18 

or consumer electronics devices generally cause sharp declines in demand for our products declines in consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services and on our financial condition and results of operations 

while sales to edge noncomputeclient noncompute and cloud systems and solutions markets are becoming a more significant source of revenue sales to the edge computeclient compute market remain an important part of our business the edge computeclient compute market however has been and we expect it to continue to be adversely affected by the growth of tablet computers smart phones and similar devices that perform many of the same capabilities as computers the lengthening of product life cycles and macroeconomic conditions we believe that the deterioration of the edge computeclient compute market has accelerated recently and that this accelerated deterioration may continue or further accelerate which could cause our operating results to suffer additionally if demand in the edge computeclient compute market is worse than expected as a result of these or other conditions demand for our products in the edge computeclient compute market may decrease at a faster rate and our operating results may be adversely affected 

the enterprise storage market for disk drives has been adversely affected by the growth of the utilization of nand flash memory in mission critical applications this deterioration of the enterprise storage disk drive market could cause our operating results to suffer an acceleration of the pace of migration of the enterprise storage market to nand flash memory products may materially adversely affect our financial results 

historically causes of declines in demand for our products have included weakness in macroeconomic environments announcements or introductions of major new operating systems or semiconductor improvements or shifts in consumer preferences and behavior such as the shift to mobile devices we believe these announcements and introductions have from time to time caused consumers to defer their purchases and made inventory obsolete whenever an oversupply of products causes participants in our industry to have higher than anticipated inventory levels we experience even more intense price competition from other manufacturers than usual which may materially adversely affect our financial results 

increases in the areal density of our disk drives may outpace our customers’ demand for storage capacity 

the rate of increase in areal density or storage capacity per square inch on a disk may be greater than the increase in our customers’ demand for aggregate storage capacity particularly in certain market applications such as edge computeclient compute as a result our customers’ storage capacity needs may be satisfied with lower priced low capacity disk drives these factors could decrease our sales especially when combined with continued price erosion which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we may not be successful in our efforts to grow our cloud systems and solutions revenues 

we have made and continue to make investments to grow our cloud systems and solutions revenues our ability to grow cloud systems and solutions revenues is subject to the following risks 

 

  

  

  

  

 our results of operations and share price may be adversely affected if we are not successful in our efforts to grow our revenues as anticipated in addition our growth in these markets may bring us into closer competition with some of our customers or potential customers which may decrease their willingness to do business with us 

 

seagate technology public limited company  2018 form 10k  19 

changes in the macroeconomic environment may in the future negatively impact our results of operations 

changes in macroeconomic conditions may affect consumer and enterprise spending and as a result our customers may postpone spending in response to volatility in credit and equity markets negative financial news andor declines in income or asset values all of which may have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products additionally enterprise spending continues to remain cautious in many regions around the world other factors that could influence demand include conditions in the labor market healthcare costs access to credit consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior these and other economic factors could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and on our financial condition and results of operations 

macroeconomic developments such as the pending withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union the debt crisis in certain countries in the european union slowing economies in parts of asia and south america or increased tariffs could negatively affect our business operating results or financial condition which in turn could adversely affect the price of our ordinary shares a general weakening of and related declining corporate confidence in the global economy or the curtailment in government or corporate spending could cause current or potential customers to reduce their it budgets or be unable to fund hardware systems which could cause customers to delay decrease or cancel purchases of our products or cause customers not to pay us or to delay paying us for previously purchased products and services 

our quarterly results of operations fluctuate sometimes significantly from period to period and may cause our share price to decline 

our quarterly revenue and results of operations may fluctuate sometimes significantly from period to period these fluctuations which we expect to continue may be occasioned by a variety of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

seagate technology public limited company  2018 form 10k  20 

as a result we believe that quartertoquarter and yearoveryear comparisons of our revenue and results of operations may not be meaningful and that these comparisons may not be an accurate indicator of our future performance our results of operations in one or more future quarters may fail to meet the expectations of investment research analysts or investors which could cause an immediate and significant decline in our market value 

we experience seasonal declines in the sales of our products during the second half of our fiscal year which may adversely affect our results of operations 

sales of computer systems storage subsystems and consumer electronics tend to be seasonal and therefore we expect to continue to experience seasonality in our business as we respond to variations in our customers’ demand for our products in particular we anticipate that sales of our products will continue to be lower during the second half of our fiscal year in the edge computeclient compute and edge noncomputeclient noncompute market applications of our disk drive business this seasonality is partially attributable to the historical trend in our results derived from our customers’ increased sales of desktop computers notebook computers and consumer electronics during the backtoschool and winter holiday season in the enterprise storage market our sales are seasonal because of the capital budgeting and purchasing cycles of our end users since our working capital needs peak during periods in which we are increasing production in anticipation of orders that have not yet been received our results of operations will fluctuate seasonally even if the forecasted demand for our products proves accurate furthermore it is difficult for us to evaluate the degree to which this seasonality may affect our business in future periods because of the rate and unpredictability of product transitions and new product introductions particularly in the edge noncomputeclient noncompute market as well as macroeconomic conditions 

we have a long and unpredictable sales cycle for enterprise data storage solutions which impairs our ability to accurately predict our financial and operating results in any periods and may adversely affect our ability to forecast the need for investments and expenditures 

our enterprise data storage solutions are technically complex and we typically supply them in high quantities to a small number of customers many of our products are also tailored to meet the specific requirements of individual customers and are often integrated by our customers into the systems and products that they sell factors that affect the length of our sales cycle include 

 

  

  

 as a result our sales cycle for enterprise data storage solutions is often in excess of one year and frequently unpredictable given the length of development and unpredictability of the sales cycle we may be unable to accurately forecast product demand which may result in lost sales or excess inventory and associated inventory reserves or writedowns each of which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition the emerging and evolving nature of the market for the products that we sell may lead prospective customers to postpone their purchasing decisions we invest resources and incur costs during this cycle that may not be recovered if we do not successfully conclude sales these factors lead to difficulty in matching revenues with expenses and increased expenditures and inventory which together may adversely impact our results of operations 

we may be adversely affected by the loss of or reduced delayed or canceled purchases by one or more of our key customers or a counterparty’s default 

some of our key customers account for a large portion of our disk drive revenue while we have longstanding relationships with many of our customers if any of our key customers were to significantly reduce their purchases from us our results of operations would be adversely affected although sales to key customers may vary from period to period a key customer that permanently discontinues or significantly reduces its relationship with us could be difficult to replace in line with industry practice new customers usually require that we pass a lengthy and rigorous qualification process at the customer’s cost accordingly it may be difficult or costly for us to attract new key customers additionally mergers acquisitions 

 

seagate technology public limited company  2018 form 10k  21 

consolidations or other significant transactions involving our customers generally entail risks to our business if a significant transaction involving any of our key customers results in the loss of or reduction in purchases by these key customers it could have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if a counterparty fails to comply with their contractual obligations our business results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected our ability to mitigate a counterparty’s default may be impeded or diminished by various factors including the terms of our contractual arrangements market conditions counterparty insolvency or bankruptcy or applicable laws and regulations 

we are dependent on sales to distributors and retailers which may increase price erosion and the volatility of our sales 

a substantial portion of our sales has been to distributors of disk drive products certain of our distributors may also market other products that compete with our products product qualification programs in this distribution channel are limited which increases the number of competing products that are available to satisfy demand particularly in times of lengthening product cycles as a result purchasing decisions in this channel are based largely on price terms and product availability sales volumes through this channel are also less predictable and subject to greater volatility than sales to our oem customers in addition deterioration in business and economic conditions could exacerbate price erosion and volatility as distributors lower prices to compensate for lower demand and higher inventory levels our distributors’ ability to access credit for purposes of funding their operations may also affect purchases of our products by these customers if distributors reduce their purchases of our products or prices decline significantly in this distribution channel or if distributors experience financial difficulties or terminate their relationships with us our revenues and results of operations would be adversely affected 

in addition retail sales of our consumer solutions traditionally experience seasonal variability in demand with higher levels of demand in the first half of our fiscal year driven by consumer spending in the backtoschool season from late summer to fall and the traditional holiday shopping season from fall to winter our ability to reach such consumers depends on us maintaining effective working relationships with major retailers and distributors failure to anticipate consumer demand for our branded solutions as well as an inability to maintain effective working relationships with retail and online distributors may adversely impact our future results of operations 

our international sales and manufacturing operations subject us to risks that may adversely affect our business related to disruptions in foreign markets currency exchange fluctuations longer payment cycles seasonality limitations imposed by a variety of legal and regulatory regimes potential adverse tax consequences increased costs our customers’ credit and access to capital healthrelated risks investment risks tariffs privacy and protection of data and access to personnel 

we have significant sales and manufacturing operations in foreign countries including manufacturing facilities sales personnel and customer support operations we have manufacturing facilities in china malaysia northern ireland singapore and thailand in addition to those in the united states additionally the manufacturing of some of our products is concentrated in certain geographical locations the production of certain drive subassemblies are limited to thailand and the production of media is limited to singapore disruptions in the economic environmental political legal or regulatory landscape in these countries may have a material adverse impact on our manufacturing operations 

our international operations are subject to economic risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries including the following

declines in the value of our investment in kk pangea “pangea” may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 

on may 31 2018 we invested 13 billion in nonconvertible preferred stock of pangea for the acquisition of toshiba memory corporation with a consortium of investors led by bain capital private equity the investment with a contractual maturity of six years is accounted for as a heldtomaturity debt security carried at amortized cost and has a contractual paymentinkind “pik” income that is accrued and added to the carrying value of the investment if the fair value of our investment including the accrued pik income declines we may be required to record impairment charges which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our results of operations numerous factors could cause the fair value of our investment to decline including the credit worthiness of pangea adverse changes in business climate adverse actions by regulators or unanticipated changes in the competitive environment or the industries in which pangea operates increased volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty could increase the risk that actual amounts realized on our investment may differ significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them 

we could suffer a loss of revenue and increased costs exposure to significant liability including legal and regulatory consequences reputational harm and other serious negative consequences if we encounter cyberattacks ransomware or other cyber security breaches that disrupt our operations or result in the dissemination of proprietary or confidential information about us or our customers or other third parties 

our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer equipment and the electronic data stored in our databases from damage by among other things earthquake floods fire natural disasters accidents power or water disruptions telecommunications failures acts of terrorism or war employee misconduct physical or electronic breakins cyberattacks ransomware system security breaches or similar events or disruptions we manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our operations as our operations become more automated and increasingly interdependent our exposure to the risks posed by these types of events will increase the measures we have implemented to secure our computer equipment and electronic data may be vulnerable to employee error hacking malfeasance system error or other irregularities and may not be sufficient for all eventualities the insurance coverage we maintain that is intended to address certain data security risks may be insufficient to cover all types of claims or losses that may arise we have been and will likely continue to be subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes cyberattacks or other computerrelated attempts to breach the information technology “it” systems we use for these purposes we may also be subject to it system failures and network disruptions due to these factors experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of thirdparties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products such attempts are increasing in technical sophistication number and ability to evade detection or to obscure such activities although we take steps to protect against and detect such attempts our efforts may not be sufficient for all eventualities in addition sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from thirdparties may contain defects in design or manufacture including “bugs” and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system 

the costs to us to eliminate or address the foregoing security problems and security vulnerabilities before or after a cyberincident could be significant system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions we could lose existing or potential customers for outsourcing services or other it solutions in connection with any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products some of our products contain encryption and other measures to protect thirdparty content stored on our products such measures may be compromised breached or circumvented by sophisticated attackers and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information may occur breaches of our security measures and the unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers or other thirdparties could expose us our vendors and customers or other thirdparties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation or governmental investigations and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business failure to meet our contractual obligations to promote information security with certain customers may result in liability including additional costs indemnification claims litigation and damage to our brand and reputation in addition we rely in certain limited capacities on thirdparty data 

 

seagate technology public limited company  2018 form 10k  25 

management providers whose possible security problems and security vulnerabilities may have similar effects on us our business brand and reputation could also be adversely affected by media or other reports of perceived security vulnerabilities in our products network or processes even if unsubstantiated 

we are subject to laws rules and regulations in the us uk eu and other countries relating to the collection use and security of user data in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries and among us our subsidiaries and other parties with which we have commercial relations our ability to execute transactions and to possess and use personal information and data in conducting our business subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens that may require us to notify vendors customers or employees of a data security breach we have incurred and will continue to incur significant expenses to comply with mandatory privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law regulation industry standards or contractual obligations these laws protocols and standards continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices if we fail to comply with applicable federal state or international privacyrelated or data protection laws we may be subject to proceedings by governmental entities and incur penalties significant legal liability or reputational harm 

we must successfully maintain and upgrade our it systems and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we expand and improve our it systems to support our business going forward consequently we are in the process of implementing and will continue to invest in and implement modifications and upgrades to our it systems and procedures including making changes to legacy systems or acquiring new systems with new functionality and building new policies procedures training programs and monitoring tools these types of activities subject us to inherent costs and risks associated with changing and acquiring these systems including capital expenditures additional operating expenses demands on management time and other risks and costs of delays or difficulties in transitioning to or integrating new systems into our current systems these implementations modifications and upgrades may not result in productivity improvements at a level that outweighs the costs of implementation or at all in addition difficulties with implementing new technology systems delays in our timeline for planned improvements significant system failures or our inability to successfully modify our it systems to respond to changes in our business needs may cause disruptions in our business operations and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we may be subject to litigation government investigations or governmental proceedings which may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 

from time to time we may be involved in various legal regulatory or administrative investigations negotiations or proceedings arising in the normal course of business in the event of litigation government investigations or governmental proceedings we are subject to the inherent risks and uncertainties that may result if outcomes differ from our expectations in the event of adverse outcomes in any litigation investigation or government proceeding we could be required to pay substantial damages fines or penalties and cease certain practices or activities which could materially harm our business 

the costs associated with litigation and government investigations can also be unpredictable depending on the complexity and length of time devoted to such litigation or investigation litigation investigations or government proceedings may also divert the efforts and attention of our key personnel which could also harm our business 

if we do not control our fixed costs we will not be able to compete effectively in our industry 

we continually seek to make our cost structure and business processes more efficient we are focused on increasing workforce flexibility and scalability and improving overall competitiveness by leveraging our global capabilities as well as external talent and skills worldwide our strategy involves to a substantial degree increasing revenue and product volume while at the same time controlling operating expenses if we do not control our operating expenses our ability to compete in the marketplace may be impaired in the past activities to reduce operating costs have included closures and transfers of facilities significant personnel reductions restructuring efforts and efforts to increase automation our restructuring efforts may not yield the intended benefits and may be unsuccessful or disruptive to our business operations which may materially adversely affect our financial results 

 

seagate technology public limited company  2018 form 10k  26 

if we experience shortages or delays in the receipt of or cost increases in critical components equipment or raw materials necessary to manufacture our products we may suffer lower operating margins production delays and other material adverse effects 

the cost quality and supply of components subassemblies certain equipment and raw materials used to manufacture our products and key components like recording media and heads are critical to our success the equipment we use to manufacture our products and components is frequently custom made and comes from a few suppliers and the lead times required to obtain manufacturing equipment can be significant particularly important for our products are components such as readwrite heads substrates for recording media asics spindle motors printed circuit boards suspension assemblies and nand flash memory 

we rely on sole suppliers or a limited number of suppliers for some or all of these components that we do not manufacture including substrates for recording media readwrite heads asics spindle motors printed circuit boards suspension assemblies and nand flash memory many of such component suppliers are geographically concentrated which makes our supply chain more vulnerable to regional disruptions such as severe weather acts of terrorism and an unpredictable geopolitical climate which may have a material impact on the production and availability of many components if our vendors for these components are unable to meet our cost quality and supply requirements continue to remain financially viable or fulfill their contractual commitments and obligations we could experience a shortage in supply or an increase in production costs which would materially adversely affect our results of operations 

certain rare earth elements are critical in the manufacture of our products we purchase components that contain rare earth elements from a number of countries including china we cannot predict whether any nation will impose regulations or trade barriers including tariffs duties quotas or embargoes upon the rare earth elements incorporated into our products that would restrict the worldwide supply of such metals or increase their cost we have experienced increased costs and production delays when we were unable to obtain the necessary equipment or sufficient quantities of some components andor have been forced to pay higher prices or make volume purchase commitments or advance deposits for some components equipment or raw materials that were in short supply in the industry in general further if our customers experience shortages of components or materials used in their products it could result in a decrease in demand for our products and have an adverse effect on our results of operations if any major supplier were to restrict the supply available to us or increase the cost of the rare earth elements used in our products we could experience a shortage in supply or an increase in production costs which would adversely affect our results of operations 

consolidation among component manufacturers has resulted and may continue to result in some component manufacturers exiting the industry or not making sufficient investments in research to develop new components 

if there is a shortage of or delay in supplying us with critical components equipment or raw materials then 

 

  

  

  

 we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain critical components in a timely and economic manner many of our suppliers’ manufacturing facilities are fully utilized if they fail to invest in capacity or in the required timeframe such failure would have an impact on our ability to ramp new products and may result in a loss of revenue or market share if our competitors did not utilize the same components and were not affected 

we often aim to lead the market in new technology deployments and leverage unique and customized technology from single source suppliers who are early adopters in the emerging market our options in supplier selection in these cases are 

 

seagate technology public limited company  2018 form 10k  27 

limited and the supplier based technology may consequently be single sourced until wider adoption of the technology occurs and any necessary licenses become available in such cases any technical issues in the supplier’s technology may cause us to delay shipments of our new technology deployments and harm our financial position 

if revenues fall or customer demand decreases significantly we may not meet all of our purchase commitments to certain suppliers 

from time to time we enter into longterm noncancelable purchase commitments or make large upfront investments with certain suppliers in order to secure certain components or technologies for the production of our products or to supplement our internal manufacturing capacity for certain components if our actual revenues in the future are lower than our projections or if customer demand decreases significantly below our projections we may not meet all of our purchase commitments with these suppliers as a result it is possible that our revenues will not be sufficient to recoup our upfront investments in which case we will have to shift output from our internal manufacturing facilities to these suppliers or make penaltytype payments under the terms of these contracts additionally because our markets are volatile competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes we face inventory and other asset risks in the event we do not fully utilize firm purchase commitments 

conflict minerals regulations may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products 

in august 2012 the sec adopted rules establishing additional disclosure and reporting requirements regarding the use of specified minerals or conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured these rules may require us to determine disclose and report whether or not such conflict minerals originate from the democratic republic of the congo or an adjoining country these rules could affect our ability to source directly or indirectly certain materials used in our products at competitive prices and could impact the availability of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products including gold tantalum tin and tungsten as there may be only a limited number of suppliers of “conflict free” minerals we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary conflict free minerals in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices our customers including our oem customers may require that our products be free of conflict minerals and our revenues and margins may be harmed if we are unable to procure conflict free minerals at a reasonable price or at all or are unable to pass through any increased costs associated with meeting these demands additionally we may face reputational challenges with our customers and our manufacturing stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of all minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement we may also face challenges with government regulators and our customers and suppliers if we are unable to sufficiently verify that the metals used in our products are conflict free we expect that there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements such as costs related to determining the source of certain minerals used in our products as well as costs related to possible changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification and disclosure requirements additionally the regulatory and compliance framework for conflict minerals may undergo changes which may further increase the cost of compliance our customers and manufacturing stakeholders may place increased demands on our compliance framework which may in turn negatively impact our relationships with our suppliers 

the loss of key executive officers and employees could negatively impact our business prospects 

our future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued service of key members of management as well as marketing sales and product development personnel the loss of one or more of our key personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we believe our future success will also depend in large part upon our ability to attract retain and further motivate highly skilled management marketing sales and product development personnel we have experienced intense competition for personnel and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our key employees or that we will be successful in attracting assimilating and retaining personnel in the future 

due to the complexity of our products some defects may only become detectable after deployment 

our products are highly complex and are designed to operate in and form part of larger complex networks and storage systems our products may contain a defect or be perceived as containing a defect by our customers as a result of improper use or maintenance lead times required to manufacture certain components are significant and a quality excursion may take 

 

seagate technology public limited company  2018 form 10k  28 

significant time and resources to remediate defects in our products thirdparty components or in the networks and systems of which they form a part directly or indirectly have resulted in and may in the future result in 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 defects in our products could also result in legal actions by our customers for property damage injury or death such legal actions including but not limited to product liability claims could exceed the level of insurance coverage that we have obtained any significant uninsured claims could significantly harm our financial condition 

political events war terrorism natural disasters public health issues and other circumstances could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

war terrorism geopolitical uncertainties natural disasters public health issues and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy and thus could have a strong negative effect on our business our suppliers logistics providers manufacturing vendors and customers our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes fires power or water shortages terrorist attacks other hostile acts labor disputes public health issues and other events beyond our control such events may decrease demand for our products make it difficult or impossible for us to make and deliver products to our customers or to receive components from our suppliers and create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain in the event of a natural disaster losses and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations and our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected should major public health issues including pandemics arise we could be negatively affected by stringent employee travel restrictions additional limitations in freight services governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in our operations and some of our key customers 

failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the sale and manufacturing of products in certain states and countries may subject us and our suppliers to state federal and international laws and regulations governing protection of the environment including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites restrictions on the presence of certain substances in electronic products and the responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling we endeavor to ensure that we and our suppliers comply with all applicable environmental laws and regulations however compliance may increase our operating costs and otherwise impact future financial results if additional or more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future we could incur additional operating costs and capital expenditures if we fail to comply with applicable environmental laws regulations initiatives or standards of conduct our customers may refuse to purchase our products and we could be subject to fines penalties and possible prohibition of sales of our products into one or more states or countries liability to our customers and damage to our reputation which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

any cost reduction initiatives that we undertake may not deliver the results we expect and these actions may adversely affect our business 

from time to time we engage in restructuring plans that may result in workforce reduction and consolidation of our real estate facilities and our manufacturing footprint in addition management will continue to evaluate our global footprint and cost 

 

seagate technology public limited company  2018 form 10k  29 

structure and additional restructuring plans are expected to be formalized as a result of our restructuring we may experience a loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge disruptions to our operations and inefficiency during transitional periods additionally global footprint consolidation and reduction in excess capacity may result in us being unable to respond to increase in forecasted volume of customer demand and loss of revenue opportunity if our competitors have underutilized factories any costcutting measures could impact employee retention in addition we cannot be sure that the cost reduction and global footprint consolidation will be successful in reducing our overall expenses as we expect or that additional costs will not offset any such reductions or global footprint consolidation if our operating costs are higher than we expect or if we do not maintain adequate control of our costs and expenses our results of operations may be adversely affected 

our ability to use our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards might be limited 

the use of a portion of our us net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards is subject to annual limitations pursuant to us tax law section 382 of the us internal revenue code generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards that might be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone significant changes in ownership as a result future changes in ownership could put further limitations on the availability of our net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards 

deterioration in global credit and financial market conditions could negatively impact the value of our current portfolio of cash equivalents or shortterm investments and our ability to meet our financing objectives 

our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase our shortterm investments may include readily marketable debt securities with remaining maturities of more than 90 days at the time of purchase our investment policy has as its principal objectives the preservation of principal and maintenance of liquidity we mitigate default risk by investing in highquality investment grade securities with different counterparties limiting the time to maturity and by monitoring the counterparties and underlying obligors closely 

we are not aware of any current material downgrades losses or other significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or shortterm investments however no assurance can be given that future deterioration in conditions of the global credit and financial markets would not negatively impact our current portfolio of cash equivalents or shortterm investments or our ability to meet our financing objectives 

we are at times subject to intellectual property legal proceedings and claims which could cause us to incur significant additional costs or prevent us from selling our products and which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject from timetotime to legal proceedings and claims including claims of alleged infringement of the patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties by us or our customers in connection with their use of our products intellectual property litigation can be expensive and timeconsuming regardless of the merits of any claim and could divert our management’s attention from operating our business in addition intellectual property lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties due to the complexity of the technical issues involved which may cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations patent litigation has increased due to the current uncertainty of the law and the increasing competition and overlap of product functionality in the field some of the actions that we face from timetotime seek injunctions against the sale of our products andor substantial monetary damages which if granted or awarded could materially harm our business financial condition and operating results 

we cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of others we may not be aware of currently filed patent applications that relate to our products or technology if patents are later issued on these applications we may be liable for infringement if our products were found to infringe the intellectual property rights of others we could be required to pay substantial damages cease the manufacture use and sale of infringing products in one or more geographic locations expend significant resources to develop noninfringing technology discontinue the use of specific processes or obtain licenses to the technology infringed we might not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms or at all or be able to reengineer our products successfully to avoid infringement any of the foregoing could cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling our products which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary datanote 14 legal environmental and other contingencies” contained in this report for a description of pending intellectual property proceedings 

 

seagate technology public limited company  2018 form 10k  30 

we may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights in the past we have been involved in significant and expensive disputes regarding our intellectual property rights and those of others including claims that we may be infringing patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights of thirdparties we expect that we will be involved in similar disputes in the future 

there can be no assurance that 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition our competitors may be able to design their products around our patents and other proprietary rights enforcement of our rights often requires litigation if we bring a patent infringement action and are not successful our competitors would be able to use similar technology to compete with us moreover the defendant in such an action may successfully counter sue us for infringement of their patents or assert a counterclaim that our patents are invalid or unenforceable 

furthermore we have significant operations and sales in foreign countries where intellectual property laws and enforcement policies are often less developed less stringent or more difficult to enforce than in the united states therefore we cannot be certain that we will be able to protect our intellectual property rights in jurisdictions outside the united states 

the price of our ordinary shares may be volatile and could decline significantly

 our company 

we are a leading provider of data storage technology and solutions our principal products are hard disk drives commonly referred to as disk drives hard drives or hdds in addition to hdds we produce a broad range of data storage products including solid state drives “ssds” solid state hybrid drives “sshds” and storage subsystems 

hard disk drives are devices that store digitally encoded data on rapidly rotating disks with magnetic surfaces disk drives continue to be the primary medium of mass data storage due to their performance attributes high quality and cost effectiveness complementing existing data center storage architecture solidstate storage devices use integrated circuit assemblies as memory to store data and most ssds use nand flash memory in addition to hdds and ssds sshds combine the features of ssds and hdds in the same unit containing a high capacity hard disk drive and a smaller ssd acting as a cache to improve performance of frequently accessed data 

our hdd products are designed for mission critical and nearline applications in enterprise servers and storage systems edge computeclient compute applications where our products are designed primarily for desktop and mobile computing and edge noncomputeclient noncompute applications where our products are designed for a wide variety of end user devices such as portable external storage systems surveillance systems digital video recorders “dvrs” networkattached storage 

 

seagate technology public limited company  2018 form 10k  39 

“nas” and gaming consoles our ssd products mainly include serial attached scsi “sas” and nonvolatile memory express “nvme” ssds 

our cloud systems and solutions portfolio includes modular original equipment manufacturer “oem” storage systems and scaleout storage servers 

business overview 

our industry is characterized by several trends and factors that have a material impact on our strategic planning financial condition and results of operations 

demand for data storage 

the international data corporation “idc” forecasted in its 2017 data age 2025 study that the global datasphere will grow to 163 zettabytes by 2025 according to idc we are fast approaching a new era of the data age which we expect will have a positive impact on storage demand we believe that the continued advancement of the cloud the further development of edge computing the global proliferation of mobile devices the evolution of the internet of things “iot” the increasing use of video surveillance the evolution of consumer electronic devices and the enterprise use of big data analytics are driving the growth of digital content factors contributing to the growth of digital content include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result of these factors we anticipate that the nature and volume of content being created will require greater storage which is more efficiently and economically facilitated by higher capacity storage devices in order to store manage distribute analyze and backup such content we expect this to support the growth in demand for data storage solutions in developed and emerging economies 

in addition the economics of storage infrastructure are also evolving with the utilization of public and private hyperscale storage and opensource solutions reducing the total cost of ownership of storage while increasing the speed and efficiency with which customers can leverage massive computing and storage devices accordingly we expect these trends will continue to create significant demand for data storage solutions going forward 

demand trends 

we believe that continued growth in digital content requires increasingly higher storage capacity in order to store aggregate host distribute analyze manage protect backup and use such content we also believe that as architectures evolve to serve the growing commercial and consumer user base throughout the world the storage solutions will evolve as well 

we expect increased data creation will lead to the expansion of the need for storage in the form of both hdds and ssds while the advance of solid state technology in many end markets is expected to increase we believe that in the foreseeable 

 

seagate technology public limited company  2018 form 10k  40 

future cloud traditional enterprise client and consumer markets that require highcapacity storage solutions will be best served by hard disk drives due to their ability to deliver the most cost effective reliable and energy efficient mass storage devices we also believe that as hard disk drive capacities continue to increase a focus exclusively on unit demand does not reflect the increase in demand for exabytes this has resulted in demand for fewer units but with higher average capacity per drive 

industry supply balance 

from time to time the storage industry has experienced periods of imbalance between supply and demand to the extent that the storage industry builds or maintains capacity based on expectations of demand that do not materialize price erosion may become more pronounced conversely during periods where demand exceeds supply price erosion is generally muted 

price erosion 

historically our industry has been characterized by price declines for disk drive products with comparable capacity performance and feature sets “likeforlike products” price declines for likeforlike products “price erosion” tend to be more pronounced during periods of 

 

  

  

 disk drive manufacturers typically attempt to offset price erosion with an improved mix of disk drive products characterized by higher capacity better performance and additional feature sets and product cost reductions 

we believe the hdd industry experienced modest price erosion in fiscal years 2016 2017 and 2018 

product life cycles and changing technology 

success in our industry has been dependent to a large extent on the ability to balance the introduction and transition of new products with timetovolume performance capacity and quality metrics at a competitive price level of service and support that our customers expect generally the drive manufacturer that introduces a new product first benefits from improved product mix favorable profit margins and less pricing pressure until comparable products are introduced changing technology also necessitates ongoing investments in research and development which may be difficult to recover due to rapid product life cycles and economic declines further there is a continued need to successfully execute product transitions and new product introductions as factors such as quality reliability and manufacturing yields continue to be of significant competitive importance 

seasonality 

the disk drive industry traditionally experiences seasonal variability in demand with higher levels of demand in the second half of the calendar year this seasonality is driven by consumer spending in the backtoschool season from late summer to fall and the traditional holiday shopping season from fall to winter beyond traditional seasonality variability of sales can be related to it spending or a reflection of more cyclical demand from csps based on the timing of procurement deployment and market supply and demand balance of other components such as nand and dram 

fiscal year 2018 summary 

during fiscal year 2018 we shipped 338 exabytes of hdd storage capacity we generated revenue of 112 billion and gross margins of 30 and our operating cash flow was 21 billion we invested 13 billion in nonconvertible preferred stock of kk pangea for the acquisition of toshiba memory corporation with a consortium of investors led by bain capital private equity we paid 726 million in dividends repurchased approximately 10 million of our ordinary shares for 361 million and paid 214 million for the repurchase of certain of our outstanding debt

operating expenses 

 

 product development expense product development expenses for fiscal year 2018 decreased by 206 million from fiscal year 2017 primarily due to a 97 million decrease in salaries and related benefits as a result of the restructuring of our workforce in prior periods an 83 million decrease due to related operational efficiencies and a 26 million decrease due to impairment charges related to the closure of our korea design center in fiscal year 2017 that did not recur in fiscal year 2018 

marketing and administrative expense marketing and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2018 decreased by 44 million from fiscal year 2017 primarily due to a 54 million decrease in salaries and related benefits as a result of the restructuring of our workforce in prior periods partially offset by an increase in other general expenses 

amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles for fiscal year 2018 decreased by 51 million as compared to fiscal year 2017 due to certain intangible assets reaching the end of their useful life 

restructuring and other net restructuring and other net for fiscal year 2018 was comprised primarily of restructuring charges recorded during the september 2017 quarter and december 2017 quarter to reduce our workforce by approximately 1100 employees restructuring and other net also included a gain of 25 million from the sale of certain properties previously classified as held for sale 

restructuring and other net for fiscal year 2017 was comprised of restructuring charges recorded during the september 2016 quarter and march 2017 quarter to reduce our workforce by approximately 6800 employees as we continue to consolidate our global footprint across asia emea and the americas 

other expense net 

 

 other expense net for fiscal year 2018 decreased by 23 million as compared to fiscal year 2017 due to a 26 million increase in interest income primarily driven by higher interest rates a 9 million net decrease in losses related to strategic investments and a 6 million net decrease in losses due to favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates partially offset by an 18 million net increase in interest expense due to the issuance of 125 billion of senior notes in fiscal year 2017 and reduced by the subsequent repurchase of certain debts 

income taxes 

 

  

seagate technology public limited company  2018 form 10k  44 

we recorded an income tax provision of 236 million for fiscal year 2018 compared to an income tax provision of 43 million for fiscal year 2017 our fiscal year 2018 income tax provision included approximately 204 million of tax expense associated with the revaluation of us deferred tax assets as a result of the enactment of the tax act on december 22 2017 offset by the reversal of previously recorded unrecognized tax benefits of 7 million and certain nonrecurring items our fiscal year 2017 income tax provision included approximately 2 million of net tax expense associated with various nonrecurring items 

our irish tax resident parent holding company owns various us and nonus subsidiaries that operate in multiple nonirish income tax jurisdictions our worldwide operating income is either subject to varying rates of income tax or is exempt from income tax due to tax incentive programs we operate under in malaysia singapore and thailand these tax incentives are scheduled to expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2027 

our income tax provision recorded for fiscal year 2018 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying the irish statutory rate of 25 to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i tax benefits related to nonus earnings generated in jurisdictions that are subject to tax incentive programs and are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of ireland and ii a reduction in the net us deferred tax assets associated with revaluation to a lower us tax rate our income tax provision recorded for fiscal year 2017 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying the irish statutory rate of 25 to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i tax benefits related to nonus earnings generated in jurisdictions that are subject to tax incentive programs and are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of ireland ii a decrease in valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets and iii permanent differences 

based on our nonus ownership structure and subject to i potential future increases in our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and ii a future change in our intention to indefinitely reinvest earnings from our subsidiaries outside of ireland we anticipate that our effective tax rate in future periods will generally be less than the irish statutory rate 

at june 29 2018 our deferred tax asset valuation allowance was approximately 12 billion 

at june 29 2018 we had net deferred tax assets of 410 million the realization of most of these deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on our ability to generate sufficient us and certain nonus taxable income in future periods although realization is not assured we believe that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable however may increase or decrease in subsequent periods when we reevaluate the underlying basis for our estimates of future us and certain nonus taxable income 

as of june 29 2018 approximately 501 million and 99 million of our total us net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards respectively are subject to annual limitations from 1 million to 45 million pursuant to us tax law 

we are required to file us federal us state and nonus income tax returns we are no longer subject to tax examination of us federal income tax returns for years prior to fiscal year 2015 with respect to us state and nonus income tax returns we are generally no longer subject to tax examination for years ending prior to fiscal year 2007 

on december 22 2017 the tax act was enacted into law in the united states the tax act significantly revises us corporate income tax law by among other things lowering us corporate income tax rates from 35 to 21 implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a onetime transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of nonus subsidiaries 

pursuant to sec staff accounting bulletin “sab” 118 regarding the application of asc 740 associated with the enactment of the tax act we recorded an adjusted tax expense of approximately 204 million for fiscal year 2018 to remeasure our net us deferred tax assets at the newly enacted 21 income tax rate this tax expense increased our effective tax rate by approximately 14 we also do not expect the onetime transition tax to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements due to an overall accumulated earnings deficit in our nonus subsidiaries for which the transition tax applies we have considered sab 118 and believe the accounting under asc 740 for the change to the us statutory tax rate to our deferred tax balances and the onetime transition tax under the tax act is complete and appropriately reflected in the financial statements during fiscal year 2018 

for all other provisions relating to the tax act we continue to evaluate the impact of the tax act’s various highly complex domestic and international provisions the other us tax changes including limitations on various business deductions such 

 

seagate technology public limited company  2018 form 10k  45 

as executive compensation under internal revenue code §162m are not expected to impact our tax expense in the shortterm due to our large net operating loss and tax credit carryovers and associated valuation allowance the tax act’s new international rules including global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” foreign derived intangible income “fdii” and base erosion antiavoidance tax “beat” are generally effective in tax years beginning after december 31 2017 these provisions are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements however these preliminary assessments and analyses are provisional and are subject to change as additional interpretive guidance is issued we will complete our analysis within fiscal year 2019 which is consistent with the guidance provided in sab 118

 product development expense product development expenses for fiscal year 2017 decreased from fiscal year 2016 primarily due to a 102 million decrease in salaries and related benefits as a result of an increase in operational efficiencies in our business and the restructuring of our workforce in prior periods offset by a 71 million increase in variable compensation and sharebased compensation driven by better financial performance of the company and a 26 million increase in impairment charges related to the closure of our korea design center 

 

seagate technology public limited company  2018 form 10k  46

restructuring and other net for fiscal year 2016 comprised of restructuring charges recorded during the september 2015 quarter march 2016 quarter and june 2016 quarter to reduce our workforce by approximately 4600 employees and align our manufacturing footprint with current macroeconomic conditions 

other expense net

net cash used in financing activities of 18 billion for fiscal year 2016 was primarily attributable to the following activities 

 

  

 liquidity sources 

our primary sources of liquidity as of june 29 2018 consisted of 1 approximately 19 billion in cash and cash equivalents 2 cash we expect to generate from operations and 3 a 700 million senior revolving credit facility 

as of june 29 2018 no borrowings had been drawn under the revolving credit facility or had been utilized for letters of credit issued under this credit facility the line of credit is available for borrowings subject to compliance with financial covenants and other customary conditions to borrowing 

the credit agreement that governs our revolving credit facility as amended includes three financial covenants 1 minimum cash cash equivalents and marketable securities 2 a fixed charge coverage ratio and 3 a net leverage ratio on april 28 2016 the revolving credit agreement was amended in order to increase the allowable net leverage ratio to adjust for our financial liquidity position the term of the revolving credit facility is through january 15 2020 provided that if we do not have investment grade ratings as defined in the revolving credit facility on august 15 2018 then the maturity date will be august 16 2018 unless certain extension conditions have been satisfied we were in compliance with the modified covenants as of june 29 2018 and expect to be in compliance for the next 12 months 

as of june 29 2018 cash and cash equivalents held by nonirish subsidiaries was 18 billion this amount is potentially subject to taxation in ireland upon repatriation by means of a dividend into our irish parent however it is our intent to indefinitely reinvest earnings of nonirish subsidiaries outside of ireland and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate such earnings by means of a taxable irish dividend should funds be needed in the irish parent company and should we be unable to fund parent company activities through means other than a taxable irish dividend we would be required to accrue and pay irish taxes on such dividend 

we believe that our sources of cash will be sufficient to fund our operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months

our liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital product development and capital expenditure needs to fund scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness and to fund our quarterly dividend and any future strategic investments our ability to fund these requirements will depend on our future cash flows which are determined by future operating performance and therefore subject to prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and financial business and other factors some of which are beyond our control 

on july 30 2018 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 063 per share which will be payable on october 3 2018 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on september 19 2018 

as of june 29 2018 we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our debt agreements based on our current outlook we expect to be in compliance with the covenants of our debt agreements over the next 12 months 

 

seagate technology public limited company  2018 form 10k  50 

the carrying value of our debt as of june 29 2018 and june 30 2017 was 48 billion and 50 billion respectively the table below presents the principal amounts of our outstanding debt 

 

 from time to time we may repurchase any of our outstanding ordinary shares through private open market tender offers broker assisted purchases or other means during fiscal year 2018 we repurchased approximately 11 million of our ordinary shares including statutory tax withholdings related to vesting of employee equity awards see “item 5 market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securitiesrepurchases of our equity securities” as of june 29 2018 09 billion remained available for repurchase under our existing repurchase authorization limit all repurchases are effected as redemptions in accordance with our articles of association 

for fiscal year 2019 we expect capital expenditures to remain below our longterm targeted range of 6 to 8 of revenue we require substantial amounts of cash to fund any increased working capital requirements future capital expenditures scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness and payments of dividends we will continue to evaluate and manage the retirement and replacement of existing debt and associated obligations including evaluating the issuance of new debt securities exchanging existing debt securities for other debt securities and retiring debt pursuant to privately negotiated transactions open market purchases tender offers or other means or otherwise in addition we may selectively pursue strategic alliances acquisitions joint ventures and investments which may require additional capital 

contractual obligations and commitments 

our contractual cash obligations and commitments as of june 29 2018 have been summarized in the table below 

 

  

  

  

  

seagate technology public limited company  2018 form 10k  51 

as of june 29 2018 we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits and an accrual for the payment of related interest totaling 62 million none of which is expected to be settled within one year outside of one year we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlement with a taxing authority will occur 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of june 29 2018 we did not have any material offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of regulation sk 

accounting policies 

the methods estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements the sec has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are highly uncertain at the time of estimation based on this definition our most critical accounting policies include establishment of sales program accruals establishment of warranty accruals accounting for income taxes the impairment assessment for goodwill and other longlived assets and investment in debt security below we discuss these policies further as well as the estimates and judgments involved we also have other accounting policies and accounting estimates relating to uncollectible customer accounts valuation of inventory valuation of sharebased payments and restructuring we believe that these other accounting policies and accounting estimates either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective or it is less likely that they would have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period 

establishment of sales program accruals we establish certain distributor and oem sales programs aimed at increasing customer demand for oem sales rebates are typically based on an oem customer’s volume of purchases or other agreed upon rebate programs for the distribution channel these programs typically involve rebates related to a distributor’s level of sales order size advertising or point of sale activity and price protection adjustments we provide for these obligations at the time that revenue is recorded based on estimated requirements we estimate these contrarevenue rebates and adjustments based on various factors including price reductions during the period reported estimated future price erosion customer orders distributor sellthrough and inventory levels program participation customer claim submittals and sales returns our estimates reflect contractual arrangements but also our judgment relating to variables such as customer claim rates and attainment of program goals and inventory and sellthrough levels reported by our distribution customers currently our distributors’ inventories are within the historical range 

while we believe we have sufficient experience and knowledge of the market and customer buying patterns to reasonably estimate such rebates and adjustments actual market conditions or customer behavior could differ from our expectations as a result actual payments under these programs which may spread over several months after the related sale may vary from the amount accrued accordingly revenues and margins in the period in which the adjustment occurs may be affected 

significant actual variations in any of the factors upon which we base our contrarevenue estimates could have a material effect on our operating results in fiscal year 2018 sales programs were approximately 12 of gross revenue for fiscal years 2017 and 2016 total sales programs of gross revenues were 11 and 13 respectively adjustments to revenues due to under or over accruals for sales programs related to revenues reported in prior quarterly periods were less than 1 of gross revenue in fiscal years 2018 2017 and 2016 any future shifts in the industry supplydemand balance as well as other factors may result in a more competitive pricing environment and may cause sales programs as a percentage of gross revenue to increase from the current or historical levels if such rebates and incentives trend upwards revenues and margins may be reduced 

establishment of warranty accruals we estimate probable product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized we generally warrant our products for a period of 1 to 5 years our warranty provision considers estimated product failure rates and trends including the timing of product returns during the warranty periods and estimated repair or replacement costs related to product quality issues if any we also exercise judgment in estimating our ability to sell certain repaired products should actual experience in any future period differ significantly from our estimates our future results of operations could be materially affected our judgment is subject to a greater degree of subjectivity with respect to newly introduced products because of limited experience with those products upon which to base our warranty estimates 

 

seagate technology public limited company  2018 form 10k  52 

the actual results with regard to warranty expenditures could have an adverse or favorable effect on our results of operations if the actual rate of unit failure the cost to repair a unit or the actual cost required to satisfy customer claims differs from those estimates we used in determining the warranty accrual since we typically outsource our warranty repairs our repair cost is subject to periodic negotiations with vendors and may vary from our estimates to the extent such sales fall below our forecast warranty cost will be adversely impacted 

we review our warranty accrual quarterly for products shipped in prior periods and which are still under warranty any changes in the estimates underlying the accrual may result in adjustments that impact the current period gross margins and net income in fiscal years 2018 2017 and 2016 net changes in estimates of prior warranty accruals as a percentage of revenue were immaterial our total warranty cost was 10 13 and 10 of revenue during fiscal years 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively while warranty cost related to new shipments exclusive of the impact of reestimates of preexisting liabilities were 13 12 and 11 respectively for the same periods changes in anticipated failure rates of specific products and significant changes in repair or replacement costs have historically been the major reasons for significant changes in prior estimates any future changes in failure rates of certain products as well as changes in repair costs or the cost of replacement parts may result in increased or decreased warranty accruals 

accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes pursuant to accounting standards codification “asc” topic 740 “asc 740” income taxes  in applying asc 740 we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits recognition of income and deductions and calculation of specific tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for income tax and financial statement purposes as well as tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions the calculation of tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the internal revenue service or other tax jurisdictions if estimates of these tax liabilities are greater or less than actual results an additional tax benefit or provision will result the deferred tax assets we record each period depend primarily on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states and certain nonus jurisdictions each period we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and if necessary we adjust the valuation allowance so that net deferred tax assets are recorded only to the extent we conclude it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized if our outlook for future taxable income changes significantly our assessment of the need for a valuation allowance may also change 

assessing goodwill and other longlived assets for impairment we account for goodwill in accordance with asc topic 350 intangibles — goodwill and other  as permitted by asc 350 we perform a qualitative assessment in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist to determine if any events or circumstances exist such as an adverse change in business climate or a decline in the overall industry that would indicate that it would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount based on the qualitative assessment if it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then the company is not required to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test if it is determined in the qualitative assessment that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not below its carrying amount including goodwill then we perform a quantitative impairment test the quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount any excess in the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill over its fair value is recognized as an impairment loss limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 

in accordance with asc 360054 impairment or disposal of longlived assets we test other longlived assets including property equipment and leasehold improvements and other intangible assets subject to amortization for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of those assets may not be recoverable we assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable we will estimate the fair value of the asset group and compare it to its carrying value the excess of the carrying value over the fair value is allocated pro rata to derive the adjusted carrying value of each asset in the asset group the adjusted carrying value of each asset in the asset group is not reduced below its fair value 

 

seagate technology public limited company  2018 form 10k  53 

assessing investment in debt security for impairment our investment in nonconvertible preferred stock of kk pangea for which we have the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity is carried at the amortized cost and classified as a heldtomaturity debt security we assess whether an otherthantemporary impairment loss on the investment including the accrued paymentinkind “pik” income has occurred due to a decline in fair value or other market conditions if the fair value of the security is below amortized cost and it is more likely than not that we will not be able to recover its amortized cost bases before its stated maturity we will record an otherthantemporary impairment charge to other net in the consolidated statements of operations

tableend we have exposure to market risks due to the volatility of interest rates foreign currency exchange rates credit rating changes equity and bond markets a portion of these risks may be hedged but fluctuations could impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash investment portfolio including investment in debt security in pangea as of june 29 2018 we had no availableforsale securities that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for a period greater than 12 months we determined no availableforsale securities were otherthantemporarily impaired as of june 29 2018 

we have fixed rate debt obligations we enter into debt obligations for general corporate purposes including capital expenditures and working capital needs 

the table below presents principal amounts and related fixed or weightedaverage interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio and debt obligations as of june 29 2018 

 

  

 foreign currency exchange risk from time to time we may enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposure related to certain foreign currency commitments and anticipated foreign currency denominated expenditures our policy prohibits us from entering into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes at this time we have not identified any material exposure associated with the potential changes related to the british vote to exit the european union 

 

seagate technology public limited company  2018 form 10k  54 

we hedge portions of our foreign currency denominated balance sheet positions with foreign currency forward exchange contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings will be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates we entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with an aggregate notional amount of 1395 billion japanese yen 13 billion at june 29 2018 to hedge foreign exchange fluctuations of our investment principal in nonconvertible preferred stock debt security of pangea we did not designate these contracts as hedges under asc 815 derivatives and hedging and therefore the change in fair value of these contracts is recognized in earnings in the same period as the gains and losses from the remeasurement of the debt security all these foreign currency forward exchange contracts mature within 12 months 

we evaluate hedging effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively we entered into a foreign currency forward exchange contract with a notional amount of approximate 7 billion japanese yen 66 million at june 29 2018 to hedge the pik income related to pangea investment which is designated as a cash flow hedge we evaluate the hedge effectiveness using the critical terms match method pursuant to asu 201712 derivatives and hedging targeted improvements to accounting for hedging activities which we adopted in the june 2018 quarter 

we did not have any material net gains losses recognized in cost of revenue or other net for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness or discontinued cash flow hedges during the fiscal years 2018 and 2017 

the table below provides information as of june 29 2018 about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts the table is provided in us dollar equivalent amounts and presents the notional amounts at the contract exchange rates and the weightedaverage contractual foreign currency exchange rates 

 

  

 we did not have outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts as of june 30 2017 

other market risks we have exposure to counterparty credit downgrades in the form of credit risk related to our foreign currency forward exchange contracts and our fixed income portfolio we monitor and limit our credit exposure for our foreign currency forward exchange contracts by performing ongoing credit evaluations we also manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with any one counterparty and we maintain limits on maximum tenor of contracts based on the credit rating of the financial institution additionally the investment portfolio is diversified and structured to minimize credit risk 

changes in our corporate issuer credit ratings have minimal impact on our near term financial results but downgrades may negatively impact our future ability to raise capital increase the cost of such capital and our ability to execute transactions with various counterparties 

we have an investment in debt security of 13 billion carried at amortized cost we review our debt security for impairment when events and circumstances indicate a decline in fair value of such asset below carrying value is otherthantemporary 

we are subject to equity market risks due to changes in the fair value of the notional investments selected by our employees as part of our nonqualified deferred compensation plan—the seagate deferred compensation plan the “sdcp” in fiscal year 2014 we entered into a total return swap “trs” in order to manage the equity market risks associated with the sdcp liabilities we pay a floating rate based on libor plus an interest rate spread on the notional amount of the trs the trs is designed to substantially offset changes in the sdcp liability due to changes in the value of the investment options made by employees see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data—note 8 derivative financial instruments” of this report on form 10k

 item 1 business tableend we are a leading provider of data storage technology and solutions our principal products are hard disk drives commonly referred to as disk drives hard drives or hdds in addition to hdds we produce a broad range of data storage products including solid state drives “ssd” and their related controllers solid state hybrid drives “sshd” and storage subsystems 

hard disk drives are devices that store digitally encoded data on rapidly rotating disks with magnetic surfaces disk drives continue to be the primary medium of mass data storage due to their performance attributes high quality and cost effectiveness complementing existing data center storage architecture solidstate storage devices use integrated circuit assemblies as memory to store data and most ssds use nandbased flash memory in addition to hdds and ssds sshds combine the features of ssds and hdds in the same unit containing a large hard disk drive and an ssd cache to improve performance of frequently accessed data 

our products are designed for mission critical and nearline applications in enterprise servers and storage systems client compute applications where our products are designed primarily for desktop and mobile computing and client noncompute applications where our products are designed for a wide variety of end user devices such as portable external storage systems surveillance systems networkattached storage “nas” digital video recorders “dvrs” and gaming consoles 

our cloud systems and solutions extend innovation from the device into the information infrastructure onsite and in the cloud our portfolio includes modular original equipment manufacturer “oem” storage systems and scaleout storage servers 

industry overview 

data storage industry 

the data storage industry is comprised of companies that manufacture components or subcomponents designed for data storage devices and companies that provide storage solutions software and services for enterprise cloud big data and computing platforms 

markets 

the principal markets served by the data storage industry are 

enterprise storage we define enterprise storage as dedicated storage area networks and hyperscale cloud storage environments enterprise data centers run solutions which are designed for mission critical performance and nearline high capacity applications 

mission critical applications are defined as those that are vital to the operation of largescale enterprise workloads requiring high performance and high reliability storage solutions we expect the market for mission critical enterprise storage solutions to continue to be driven by enterprises utilizing dedicated storage area networks our storage solutions are comprised principally of high performance enterprise class disk drives with sophisticated firmware and communications technologies 

nearline applications are defined as those which require high capacity and energy efficient storage solutions we expect such applications which include storage for cloud computing content delivery and backup services will continue to grow and drive demand for solutions designed with these attributes with the increased requirements for storage driven by the creation and consumption of mediarich digital content we expect the increased exabyte demand will require further buildout of data centers by cloud service providers and other enterprises which utilize high capacity nearline devices 

enterprise serial attached scsi “sas” ssds are designed to deliver superior performance reliability and enterprise features to meet the demands of iointensive applications with potential for substantial power savings nonvolatile memory express “nvme” ssds and addin cards are designed to optimize enterprise applications with a persistent highperformance highcapacity memory design they also leverage flash and software to accelerate any server virtualized deployment and moves any big data to the realm of real time 

client compute we define client compute applications as solutions designed for desktop and mobile compute applications ranging from traditional laptops tablets and convertible systems as the storage of digital content in the cloud becomes more prominent and accessible some client compute applications rely less on builtin storage which is supplemented by cloud computing solutions and branded external hard drives 

client noncompute we define client noncompute applications as solutions designed for consumer electronic devices and disk drives used for external storage disk drives designed for consumer electronic devices are primarily used in applications such as surveillance systems nas and dvrs that require a higher capacity low costpergigabyte storage solution disk drives for external storage is designed for purposes such as portable external storage and to augment storage capacity in the consumer’s current desktop notebook tablet or dvr devices we believe the proliferation and personal creation of mediarich digital content will continue to create increasing consumer demand for higher capacity storage solutions 

 

cloud systems and solutions we define cloud systems and solutions as applications that provide cloud based solutions to businesses for the purpose of scaleout storage solutions and modular systems systems can contain hdds and ssds and can offer file management systems software and even compute power 

participants in the data storage industry include 

major subcomponent manufacturers companies that manufacture components or subcomponents used in data storage devices or solutions include companies that supply spindle motors heads and media application specific integrated circuits “asics” 

hardware storage solutions manufacturers companies that transform components into storage products include disk drive manufacturers and semiconductor storage manufacturers which include integrating flash memory into storage products such as ssds 

system integrators companies such as oems that bundle and package storage solutions into client compute client noncompute or enterprise applications as well as enterprise storage solutions distributors that integrate storage hardware and software into enduser applications and cloud service providers “csp” that provide cloud based solutions to businesses for the purpose of scaleout storage solutions and modular systems that are also included in this category 

storage services companies that provide and host services and solutions which include storage backup archiving recovery and discovery of data 

hyperscale data centers increasingly large hyperscale data center companies are designing their own storage subsystems and having those built by contract manufacturers for use inside their own data centers this trend is reshaping the storage system and subsystem market and driving innovation in system design and changes in the competitive landscape of the large storage system vendors 

demand for data storage 

the continued advancement of the cloud the proliferation of a variety of mobile devices globally development of the internet of things “iot” increasingly pervasive use of video surveillance evolution of consumer electronic devices and enterprise use of big data analytics are driving the growth of digital content factors contributing to the growth of digital content include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result of these factors the nature and volume of content being created requires greater storage which is more efficiently and economically facilitated by higher capacity storage devices in order to store manage distribute analyze and backup such content we expect this to support the growth in demand for data storage solutions in developed and emerging economies well into the future 

the amount of data created as well as where and how data is stored continues to evolve with the proliferation of mobile devices the growth of cloud computing and the evolving iot in addition the economics of storage infrastructure are also evolving with the utilization of public and private hyperscale storage and opensource solutions reducing the total cost of ownership of storage while increasing the speed and efficiency with which customers can leverage massive computing and storage devices accordingly we expect these trends will continue to create significant demand for data storage solutions going forward 

demand trends for disk drives 

we believe that continued growth in digital content requires increasingly higher storage capacity in order to store aggregate host distribute analyze manage backup and use such content we also believe that as architectures evolve to serve the growing commercial and consumer user base throughout the world the manner in which hard drives are delivered to market and utilized by our customers will evolve as well 

 

we believe that in the foreseeable future the traditional enterprise and client compute markets that require highcapacity storage solutions and the data intensive client noncompute markets will continue to be best served by hard disk drives due to the industry’s ability to deliver the most cost effective reliable and energy efficient mass storage devices although the advance of solid state technology in the above markets is expected to increase as well furthermore the increased use of client noncompute devices that both consume mediarich digital content streamed from the cloud and create rich digital content that is stored in the cloud increases the demand for high capacity hard disk drives in enterprise nearline applications 

we also believe that as hard disk drive capacities continue to increase unit demand does not reflect the increase in exabytes demand in recent years this trend has resulted in demand for fewer units but with higher average capacity per drive 

industry supply balance 

from time to time the hdd industry has experienced periods of imbalance between supply and demand to the extent that the disk drive industry builds or maintains capacity based on expectations of demand that do not materialize price erosion may become more pronounced conversely during periods where demand exceeds supply price erosion is generally muted 

our business 

disk drive technology 

the design and manufacturing of disk drives depends on highly advanced technology and manufacturing techniques and therefore requires high levels of research and development spending and capital equipment investments we design fabricate and assemble a number of the most important components found in our disk drives including readwrite heads and recording media our design and manufacturing operations are based on technology platforms that are used to produce various disk drive products that serve multiple data storage applications and markets our core technology platforms are focused around the areal density of media and readwrite head technologies using an integrated platform design and manufacturing leverage approach allows us to deliver a portfolio of disk drive products to service a wide range of data storage applications and industries 

disk drives that we manufacture are commonly differentiated by the following key characteristics 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 areal density is measured by storage capacity per square inch on the recording surface of a disk the storage capacity of a disk drive is determined by the number of disks it contains as well as the areal density capability of these disks we have been pursuing and will continue to pursue a number of technologies to increase areal densities across the entire range of our products for expanding disk drive capacities and reducing the number of disks and heads per drive to further reduce product costs 

manufacturing 

we design and produce our own readwrite heads and recording media which are critical technologies for disk drives this integrated approach enables us to lower costs and to improve the functionality of components so that they work together efficiently 

 

we believe that because of our vertical design and manufacturing strategy we are well suited to take advantage of the opportunities to leverage the close interdependence of components for disk drives our manufacturing efficiency and flexibility are critical elements of our integrated business strategy we continuously seek to improve our manufacturing efficiency and reduce manufacturing cost by 

 

  

  

  

  

 a vertically integrated model however tends to have less flexibility when demand moderates as it exposes us to higher unit costs as capacity utilization is not optimized 

components and raw materials 

disk drives incorporate certain components including a head disk assembly and a printed circuit board mounted to the head disk assembly which are sealed inside a rigid base and top cover containing the recording components in a contamination controlled environment we maintain a highly integrated approach to our business by designing and manufacturing a significant portion of the components we view as critical to our products such as recording heads and media 

readwrite heads the function of the readwrite head is to scan across the disk as it spins magnetically recording or reading information the tolerances of recording heads are extremely demanding and require stateoftheart equipment and processes our readwrite heads are manufactured with thinfilm and photolithographic processes similar to those used to produce semiconductor integrated circuits though challenges in magnetic film properties and topographical structures are unique to the disk drive industry we perform all primary stages of design and manufacture of readwrite heads at our facilities we use a combination of internally manufactured and externally sourced readwrite heads the mix of which varies based on product mix technology and our internal capacity levels 

media information is written to the media or disk as it rotates at very high speeds past the readwrite head the media is made from nonmagnetic material usually aluminum alloy or glass and is coated with thin layers of magnetic materials we use a combination of internally manufactured and externally sourced finished media and aluminum substrates the mix of which varies based on product mix technology and our internal capacity levels we purchase all of our glass substrates from third parties 

printed circuit board assemblies the printed circuit board assemblies “pcbas” are comprised of standard and custom asics and ancillary electronic control chips the asics control the movement of data to and from the readwrite heads and through the internal controller and interface which communicates with the host computer the asics and control chips form electronic circuitry that delivers instructions to a head positioning mechanism called an actuator to guide the heads to the selected track of a disk where the data is recorded or retrieved disk drive manufacturers use one or more industry standard interfaces such as serial advanced technology architecture “sata” small computer system interface “scsi” sas or fibre channel “fc” to communicate to the host systems we outsource to third parties the manufacture and assembly of the pcbas used in our disk drives we do not manufacture any asics but we participate in their proprietary design 

head disk assembly the head disk assembly consists of one or more disks attached to a spindle assembly powered by a spindle motor that rotates the disks at a high constant speed around a hub readwrite heads mounted on an arm assembly similar in concept to that of a record player fly extremely close to each disk surface and record data on and retrieve it from concentric tracks in the magnetic layers of the rotating disks the readwrite heads are mounted vertically on an eshaped assembly “eblock” that is actuated by a voicecoil motor to allow the heads to move from track to track the eblock and the recording media are mounted inside the head disk assembly we purchase spindle motors from outside vendors and from time to time participate in the design of the motors that go into our products we use a combination of internally manufactured and externally sourced head disk assemblies 

disk drive assembly following the completion of the head disk assembly it is mated to the pcba and the completed unit goes through extensive defect mapping and testing prior to packaging and shipment disk drive assembly and test operations occur primarily at facilities located in china and thailand we perform subassembly and component manufacturing operations at our facilities in china malaysia northern ireland singapore thailand and in the united states in addition third parties manufacture and assemble components and disk drive assemblies for us in various countries worldwide 

 

suppliers of components and industry constraints there are a limited number of independent suppliers of components such as recording heads and media available to disk drive manufacturers vertically integrated disk drive manufacturers who manufacture their own components are less dependent on external component suppliers than less vertically integrated disk drive manufacturers 

commodity and other manufacturing costs the production of disk drives requires rare earth elements precious metals scarce alloys and industrial commodities which are subject to fluctuations in prices and the supply of which has at times been constrained in addition to increased costs of components and commodities volatility in fuel costs may also increase our costs related to commodities manufacturing and freight as a result we may increase our use of ocean shipments to help offset any increase in freight costs

customers 

we sell our products to major oems distributors and retailers 

the following table summarizes our hdd revenue by channel and by geography 

 

  

 oem customers typically enter into master purchase agreements with us these agreements provide for pricing volume discounts order lead times product support obligations and other terms and conditions including sales programs offered to promote selected products deliveries are scheduled only after receipt of purchase orders in addition with limited leadtime customers may defer most purchase orders without significant penalty anticipated orders from many of our customers have in the past failed to materialize or oem delivery schedules have been deferred or altered as a result of changes in their business needs 

our distributors generally enter into nonexclusive agreements for the resale of our products they typically furnish us with a nonbinding indication of their nearterm requirements and product deliveries are generally scheduled accordingly the agreements and related sales programs typically provide the distributors with limited right of return and price protection rights in addition we offer sales programs to distributors on a quarterly and periodic basis to promote the sale of selected products in the sales channel 

our retail channel consists of our branded storage products sold to retailers either by us directly or by our distributors retail sales made by us or our distributors typically require greater marketing support sales incentives and price protection periods 

in fiscal years 2017 2016 and 2015 dell inc accounted for approximately 10 12 and 14 of consolidated revenue respectively in fiscal year 2015 hewlettpackard company accounted for approximately 12 of consolidated revenue in fiscal year 2016 hp inc formerly known as hewlettpackard company completed its separation with hewlett packard enterprise company and each company accounted for less than 10 of our consolidated revenue in both fiscal year 2016 and 2017 see “item 1a risk factors—risks related to our business—we may be adversely affected by the loss of or reduced delayed or canceled purchases by one or more of our major customers” 

competition 

we compete primarily with manufacturers of hard drives used in the enterprise client compute and client noncompute applications we are also a supplier of enterprise ssds nvme addin cards cloud storage solutions and storage subsystems through our acquisitions the markets that we participate in are highly competitive disk drive manufacturers compete for a limited number of major disk drive customers but also compete with other companies in the data storage industry that provide ssds and nvme addin technology some of the principal factors used by customers to differentiate among data storage solutions manufacturers are storage capacity product performance product quality and reliability price per unit and price per gigabyte timetomarket and timetovolume leadership storageretrieval access times data transfer rates form factor product warranty and support capabilities supply continuity and flexibility power consumption total cost of ownership and brand while different markets and customers place varying levels of emphasis on these factors we believe that our products are competitive with respect to many of these factors in the markets that we currently address 

 

principal disk drive competitors there are three companies in the data storage industry that manufacture disk drives 

 

  

  

 other competition we are seeing direct competition from ssd’s that is adversely impacting demand for hdd in some markets including notebook and enterprise mission critical we expect that this trend will continue although we believe both product types will be required in the market to satisfy the growing demand for data storage 

price erosion historically our industry has been characterized by price declines for disk drive products with comparable capacity performance and feature sets “likeforlike products” price declines for likeforlike products “price erosion” tend to be more pronounced during periods of 

 

  

  

 disk drive manufacturers typically attempt to offset price erosion with an improved mix of disk drive products characterized by higher capacity better performance and additional feature sets and product cost reductions 

we believe the hdd industry experienced modest price erosion in fiscal years 2015 2016 and 2017 

product life cycles and changing technology success in our industry has been dependent to a large extent on the ability to balance the introduction and transition of new products with timetovolume performance capacity and quality metrics at a competitive price level of service and support that our customers expect generally the drive manufacturer that introduces a new product first benefits from improved product mix favorable profit margins and less pricing pressure until comparable products are introduced changing technology also necessitates ongoing investments in research and development which may be difficult to recover due to rapid product life cycles and economic declines further there is a continued need to successfully execute product transitions and new product introductions as factors such as quality reliability and manufacturing yields continue to be of significant competitive importance 

seasonality 

the disk drive industry traditionally experiences seasonal variability in demand with higher levels of demand in the second half of the calendar year this seasonality is driven by consumer spending in the backtoschool season from late summer to fall and the traditional holiday shopping season from fall to winter we believe fiscal year 2015 reflected seasonality consistent with historical patterns in fiscal year 2016 beyond traditional seasonality variability of sales was a reflection of more cyclical demand from csps based on the timing of large systems installations and the shift of the underlying technology we believe fiscal year 2017 reflected seasonality consistent with historical patterns 

research and development 

we are committed to developing new component technologies products and alternative storage technologies our research and development focus is designed to bring new products to market in high volume with quality attributes that our customers expect before our competitors part of our product development strategy is to leverage a design platform andor subsystem within product families to serve different market needs this platform strategy allows for more efficient resource utilization leverages best design practices reduces exposure to changes in demand and allows for achievement of lower costs through purchasing economies our advanced technology integration effort focuses disk drive and component research on recording subsystems including readwrite heads and recording media marketspecific product technology and technology focused towards new business opportunities the primary purpose of our advanced technology integration effort is to ensure timely availability of mature component technologies to our product development teams as well as allowing us to leverage and coordinate those technologies in the design centers across our products in order to take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace during fiscal years 2017 2016 and 2015 we had product development expenses of approximately 1232 million 1237 million and 1353 million respectively which represented 11 11 and 10 of our consolidated revenue respectively 

 

patents and licenses 

as of june 30 2017 we had approximately 5600 us patents and 1300 patents issued in various foreign jurisdictions as well as approximately 1100 us and 900 foreign patent applications pending the number of patents and patent applications will vary at any given time as part of our ongoing patent portfolio management activity due to the rapid technological change that characterizes the data storage industry we believe that in addition to patent protection the improvement of existing products reliance upon trade secrets protection of unpatented proprietary knowhow and development of new products are also important to our business in establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage accordingly we intend to continue our efforts to broadly protect our intellectual property including obtaining patents where available in connection with our research and development program 

we have patent licenses with a number of companies additionally as part of our normal intellectual property practices we may be engaged in negotiations with other major data storage companies and component manufacturers with respect to patent licenses 

the data storage industry is characterized by significant litigation arising from time to time relating to patent and other intellectual property rights because of rapid technological development in the data storage industry some of our products have been and in the future could be alleged to infringe existing patents of third parties from time to time we receive claims that our products infringe patents of third parties although we have been able to resolve some of those claims or potential claims by obtaining licenses or rights under the patents in question without a material adverse effect on us other claims have resulted in adverse decisions or settlements in addition other claims are pending which if resolved unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations for more information on these claims see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data—note 14 legal environmental and other contingencies” the costs of engaging in intellectual property litigation in the past have been and in the future may be substantial irrespective of the merits of the claim or the outcome 

backlog 

in view of industry practice whereby customers may cancel or defer orders with little or no penalty we believe backlog in the disk drive industry is of limited indicative value in estimating future performance and results 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to us and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites some of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution and these permits are subject to modification renewal and revocation by issuing authorities 

we have established environmental management systems and continually update environmental policies and standard operating procedures for our operations worldwide we believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws regulations and permits we budget for operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental laws if additional or more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future we could incur additional operating costs and capital expenditures 

some environmental laws such as the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended the “superfund” law and its state equivalents can impose liability for the cost of cleanup of contaminated sites upon any of the current or former site owners or operators or upon parties who sent waste to these sites regardless of whether the owner or operator owned the site at the time of the release of hazardous substances or the lawfulness of the original disposal activity we have been identified as a potentially responsible party at several sites at each of these sites we have an assigned portion of the financial liability based on the type and amount of hazardous substances disposed of by each party at the site and the number of financially viable parties we have fulfilled our responsibilities at some of these sites and remain involved in only a few at this time 

while our ultimate costs in connection with these sites is difficult to predict with complete accuracy based on current estimates of cleanup costs and our expected allocation of these costs we do not expect costs in connection with these sites to be material 

we may be subject to various state federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment including those restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products for example the european union “eu” enacted the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment which prohibits the use of certain substances including lead in certain products including disk drives and server storage products put on the market after july 1 2006 similar legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions including in the united states canada mexico taiwan china japan and others the european union reach directive registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals ec 19072006 also restricts substances of very high concern “svhcs” in products 

 

employees 

at june 30 2017 we employed approximately 41000 employees and temporary employees worldwide of which approximately 33000 were located in our asian operations we believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees at all levels we believe that our employee relations are good

 item 1a risk factors tableend if we fail to predict demand accurately for our products in any quarter we may not be able to recapture the cost of our investments which may materially adversely affect our financial results and the results of our operations 

our industry operates primarily on quarterly purchasing cycles with much of the order flow in any given quarter typically coming at the end of that quarter our quarterly results are subject to substantial fluctuations and can be difficult to predict our manufacturing process requires us to make significant productspecific investments in inventory in each quarter for that quarter’s production since we typically receive the bulk of our orders late in a quarter after we have made our investments there is a risk that our orders will not be sufficient to allow us to recapture the costs of our investment before the products resulting from that investment have become obsolete we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to accurately predict demand in the future 

our revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent upon customer orders in that quarter we attempt to project future orders based in part on estimates from our major customers our customers’ estimated requirements are not always accurate and we therefore cannot predict our quarterly revenues with any degree of certainty in addition we derive a portion of our revenues in each quarter from a number of relatively large orders if one or more of our major customers decide to defer a purchase order or delays product acceptance in any given quarter this is likely to result in reduced total revenues for that quarter 

the difficulty in forecasting demand also increases the difficulty in anticipating our inventory requirements which may cause us to overproduce finished goods resulting in increased working capital requirements or underproduce finished goods adversely affecting our ability to meet customer requirements and maintain our market share additionally the risk of inventory writeoffs could increase if we were to continue to hold higher inventory levels our uneven sales cycle makes inventory management challenging and future financial results less predictable we cannot be certain that we will be able to recover the costs associated with increased inventory 

other factors that may negatively impact our ability to recapture the cost of investments in any given quarter include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition the demand for client noncompute products can be even more volatile and unpredictable than the demand for client compute products in some cases our products manufactured for client noncompute applications are uniquely configured for a single customer’s application which creates a risk of unwanted and unsellable inventory if the anticipated volumes are not realized this potential for unpredictable volatility is increased by the possibility of competing alternative storage technologies like flash memory meeting the customers’ cost and capacity metrics resulting in a rapid shift in demand from our products and disk drive technology generally to alternative storage technologies unpredictable fluctuations in demand for our products or rapid shifts in demand from our products to alternative storage technologies in new client noncompute applications could materially adversely impact our future results of operations 

 

market acceptance of new product introductions cannot be accurately predicted and our results of operations will suffer if there is less demand for our new products than is anticipated 

the markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product introductions and technology enhancements uncertain product life cycles and changes in customer demand the success of our new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors including market acceptance our ability to manage the risks associated with product transitions the effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand and the risk that our new products will have quality problems or other defects in the early stages of introduction that were not anticipated in the design of those products accordingly we cannot accurately determine the ultimate effect that our new products will have on our results of operations failure to accurately anticipate customers’ need and accurately identify the shift in technological changes could materially adversely affect our longterm financial results 

historically our results of operations have substantially depended upon our ability to be among the firsttomarket with new product offerings we may face technological operational and financial challenges in developing new products in addition our investments directed toward new product development may not yield the anticipated benefits our market share and results of operations in the future may be adversely affected if we fail to 

 

  

  

  

 in addition the success of our new product introductions is dependent upon our ability to qualify as a primary source of supply with our oem customers in order for our products to be considered by our customers for qualification we must be among the leaders in timetomarket with those new products once a product is accepted any failure or delay in the qualification process or a requirement that we requalify can result in our losing sales to that customer until new products are introduced the limited number of highvolume oems magnifies the effect of missing a product qualification opportunity these risks are further magnified because we expect competitive pressures to result in declining sales eroding prices and declining gross margins on our current generation products if the delivery of our products is delayed our oem customers may use our competitors’ products to meet their production requirements we cannot assure that we will be among the leaders in timetomarket with new products or that we will be able to successfully qualify new products with our customers in the future 

we face the related risk that consumers and businesses may wait to make their purchases if they want to buy a new product that has been announced but not yet released if this were to occur we may be unable to sell our existing inventory of products that may be less efficient and cost effective compared to new products as a result even if we are among the firsttomarket with a given product subsequent introductions or announcements by our competitors of new products could cause us to lose revenue and not achieve a positive return on our investment in existing products and inventory 

if we cannot successfully deliver competitive products our future results of operations may be adversely affected 

our industries are highly competitive and our failure to anticipate and respond to technological and market developments could harm our ability to compete 

we operate in markets that are highly competitive and subject to rapid change and that are significantly affected by new product introductions substantial price erosion and lower prices as part of a strategy to gain or retain market share and customers should these practices continue we may need to continually reduce our prices for existing products to retain our market share which could adversely affect our results of operations 

our ability to offset the effect of price erosion through new product introductions at higher average prices is diminished to the extent competitors introduce products into particular markets ahead of our similar competing products our ability to offset the effect of price erosion is also diminished during times when supply exceeds demand for a particular product 

market share for our products can be negatively affected by our customers’ diversifying their sources of supply as our competitors enter the market for particular products as well as by our ability to ramp volume production of new product offerings when our competitors successfully introduce product offerings that are competitive with our recently introduced products our customers may quickly diversify their sources of supply any significant decline in our market share in any of our principal market applications would adversely affect our results of operations 

 

our principal sources of competition include 

 

  

  

  

 we also experience competition from other companies that produce alternative storage technologies like flash memory where increasing capacity decreasing cost energy efficiency and improvements in performance ruggedness have resulted in competition with our lower capacity smaller form factor disk drives this competition has traditionally been in the markets for handheld consumer electronics applications and now it also includes ssds for tablet notebook and enterprise compute applications certain customers for both notebook and enterprise compute applications are adopting ssds as alternatives to hard drives in certain applications further adoption of these alternative storage technologies may impact the competitiveness of our product portfolio and reduce our market share and adversely affect our results of operation 

the markets for our data storage system products are also characterized by technological change driven in part by the adoption of new industry standards these standards provide mechanisms to ensure technology component interoperability can occur and may reduce our capability for differentiation or innovation and our affected products would revert to commodity status this could lower the barriers to entry to our market away from our specialist research and development skills and enable entry for the generalpurpose design skills found in some large ems and cem companies commodity markets are driven by extremely low margins and very aggressive competitive pricing if our market becomes more commoditized and we fail to deliver innovative valueadded alternatives to our customers we will have difficulty competing against the larger ems and cem companies if we are unable to compete successfully against our current and future competitors we could experience profit margin reductions or loss of market share which could significantly harm our financial condition 

we may be unable to effectively plan and make strategic changes in our business which may materially adversely affect our financial and business results additionally we may not achieve the intended benefits of our strategic change efforts 

we may not be able to identify suitable strategic alliances acquisitions joint ventures or investment opportunities to successfully acquire and integrate companies that provide complementary products or technologies or to realize the anticipated benefits of such transactions 

our growth strategy involves pursuing strategic alliances with making acquisitions of forming joint ventures with or making investments in other companies that are complementary to our business there is substantial competition for attractive strategic alliance acquisition joint venture and investment candidates additionally the current trend of consolidation in the data storage industry may materially adversely affect our business and financial results and our future growth prospects accordingly we may not be able to identify suitable strategic alliances acquisition joint venture or investment candidates even if we can identify them we cannot assure you that we will be able to partner with acquire or invest in suitable candidates or integrate acquired technologies or operations successfully into our existing technologies and operations moreover our ability to finance potential strategic alliances acquisitions joint ventures or investments may be limited by our leverage level the covenants contained in the instruments that govern our outstanding indebtedness and any agreements governing any other debt we may incur 

if we are successful in forming strategic alliances or acquiring forming joint ventures or making investments in other companies any of these transactions may have an adverse effect on our results of operations particularly while the operations of an acquired business are being integrated it is also likely that integration of acquired companies would lead to the loss of key employees from those companies or the loss of customers of those companies in addition the integration of any acquired companies would require substantial attention from our senior management which may limit the amount of time available to be devoted to our daytoday operations or to the execution of our strategy growth by strategic alliance acquisition joint venture or investment involves an even higher degree of risk to the extent we combine new product offerings and enter new markets in which we have limited experience and no assurance can be given that acquisitions of entities with new or alternative business models will be successfully integrated or achieve their stated objectives there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits of any strategic alliance acquisition joint venture or investment that we make or if we do how long it will take to achieve such benefits 

furthermore the expansion of our business involves the risk that we might not manage our growth effectively that we would incur additional debt to finance these acquisitions or investments that we may have impairment of goodwill or acquired intangible assets associated with these acquisitions and that we would incur substantial charges relating to the writeoff of inprocess research and development each of these items could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

in addition we could issue additional ordinary shares in connection with future strategic alliances acquisitions joint ventures or investments issuing shares in connection with such transactions would have the effect of diluting your ownership percentage of the ordinary shares and could cause the price of our ordinary shares to decline 

if we do not develop products in time to keep pace with technological changes our results of operations will be adversely affected 

our customers demand new generations of disk drive products as advances in computer hardware and software have created the need for improved storage products with features such as increased storage capacity improved performance and reliability and lower cost we and our competitors have developed improved products and we will need to continue to do so in the future such product development requires significant investments in research and development we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully complete the design or introduction of new products in a timely manner that we will be able to manufacture new products in sufficient volumes with acceptable manufacturing yields that we will be able to successfully market these new products or that these products will perform to specifications on a longterm basis in addition the impact of slowing areal density growth may adversely impact our ability to be successful 

when we develop new products with higher capacity and more advanced technology our results of operations may decline because the increased difficulty and complexity associated with producing these products increases the likelihood of reliability quality or operability problems if our products suffer increases in failures are of low quality or are not reliable customers may reduce their purchases of our products and our manufacturing rework and scrap costs and service and warranty costs may increase in addition a decline in the reliability of our products may make us less competitive as compared with other disk drive manufacturers or competing technologies 

we may fail to successfully anticipate technological shifts business opportunities and market demand additionally the barriers to entry in developing nand flash memory products and ssds may materially adversely affect our future growth prospects we may fail to develop new products identify business strategies and introduce competitive product offerings to meet those technological shifts which may materially adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and may impact our future financial results 

servicing our indebtedness requires a significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt 

we are leveraged and have significant debt service obligations our significant debt and debt service requirements could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities and reduce our options for capital allocation for example our high level of debt presents the following risks 

 

  

  

  

  

  

in the event that we need to refinance all or a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures we may not be able to obtain terms as favorable as the terms of our existing debt or refinance our existing debt at all if prevailing interest rates or other factors existing at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing then the interest expense relating to the refinanced debt would increase furthermore if any rating agency changes our credit rating or outlook our debt and equity securities could be negatively affected which could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt or raise additional capital 

in addition our business may not generate cash flow in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay the principal of or interest on our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs including working capital capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements 

our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control we cannot assure you that 

 

  

  

 if we cannot fund our liquidity needs we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements we cannot assure you that any of these remedies could if necessary be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all or that they would permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations in addition if we incur additional debt the risks associated with our substantial leverage including the risk that we will be unable to service our debt or generate enough cash flow to fund our liquidity needs could intensify 

changes in demand for computer systems and storage subsystems may in the future cause a decline in demand for our products 

our products are components in computers data storage systems and consumer electronics devices the demand for these products has been volatile unexpected slowdowns in demand for computer systems storage subsystems or consumer electronics devices generally cause sharp declines in demand for our products declines in consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services and on our financial condition and results of operations 

while sales to client noncompute and cloud systems and solutions markets are becoming a more significant source of revenue sales to the client compute market remain an important part of our business the client compute market however has been and we expect it to continue to be adversely affected by the growth of tablet computers smart phones and similar devices and that perform many of the same capabilities as computers the lengthening of product life cycles and macroeconomic conditions we believe that the deterioration of the client compute market has accelerated recently and that this accelerated deterioration may continue or further accelerate which could cause our operating results to suffer additionally if demand in the client compute market is worse than expected as a result of these or other conditions demand for our products in the client compute market may decrease at a faster rate and our operating results may be adversely affected 

the enterprise storage market has been adversely affected by the growth of the utilization of nand flash in mission critical applications this deterioration of the enterprise storage market could cause our operating results to suffer the potential migration of the enterprise storage market to nand flash memory products and an acceleration of the pace of migration may materially adversely affect our financial results 

causes of declines in demand for our products in the past have included weakness in macroeconomic environments announcements or introductions of major new operating systems or semiconductor improvements or changes in consumer preferences such as the shift to mobile devices we believe these announcements and introductions have from time to time caused consumers to defer their purchases and made inventory obsolete whenever an oversupply of our products causes participants in our industry to have higher than anticipated inventory levels we experience even more intense price competition from other manufacturers than usual which may materially adversely affect our financial results 

 

increases in the areal density of disk drives may outpace customers’ demand for storage capacity 

the rate of increase in areal density or storage capacity per square inch on a disk may be greater than the increase in our customers’ demand for aggregate storage capacity particularly in certain market applications like client compute as a result our customers’ storage capacity needs may be satisfied with lower priced low capacity disk drives these factors could decrease our sales especially when combined with continued price erosion which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we may not be successful in our efforts to grow our cloud systems and silicon group 

we have made and are continuing to make investments to develop our cloud systems and silicon group our cloud systems and silicon group is subject to the following risks 

 

  

  

  

  

 our results of operations and share price may be adversely affected if we are not successful in our efforts to grow our cloud computing business as anticipated in addition our growth in this sector may bring us into closer competition with some of our customers or potential customers which may decrease their willingness to do business with us 

changes in the macroeconomic environment have negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact our results of operations 

due to the continuing uncertainty about current macroeconomic conditions affecting consumer and enterprise spending we believe our customers may postpone spending in response to volatility in credit and equity markets negative financial news andor declines in income or asset values all of which could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products additionally enterprise spending continues to remain cautious in many regions around the world other factors that could influence demand include conditions in the labor market healthcare costs access to credit consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior these and other economic factors could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and on our financial condition and operating results 

macroeconomic developments like the ongoing withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union the debt crisis in certain countries in the european union and slowing economies in parts of asia and south america could negatively affect our business operating results or financial condition which in turn could adversely affect our stock price a general weakening of and related declining corporate confidence in the global economy or the curtailment in government or corporate spending could cause current or potential customers to reduce their it budgets or be unable to fund hardware systems which could cause customers to delay decrease or cancel purchases of our products or cause customers not to pay us or to delay paying us for previously purchased products and services 

our quarterly results of operations fluctuate sometimes significantly from period to period and may cause our share price to decline 

our quarterly revenue and results of operations may fluctuate sometimes significantly from period to period these fluctuations which we expect to continue may be occasioned by a variety of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result we believe that quartertoquarter and yearoveryear comparisons of our revenue and results of operations may not be meaningful and that these comparisons may not be an accurate indicator of our future performance our results of operations in one or more future quarters may fail to meet the expectations of investment research analysts or investors which could cause an immediate and significant decline in the trading price of our ordinary shares 

because we experience seasonality in the sales of our products our results of operations will generally be adversely impacted during the second half of our fiscal year 

sales of computer systems storage subsystems and consumer electronics tend to be seasonal and therefore we expect to continue to experience seasonality in our business as we respond to variations in our customers’ demand for our products in particular we anticipate that sales of our products will continue to be lower during the second half of our fiscal year in the client compute and client noncompute market applications of our disk drive business this seasonality is partially attributable to the historical trend in our results derived from our customers’ increased sales of desktop computers notebook computers and consumer electronics during the backtoschool and winter holiday season in the enterprise market our sales are seasonal because of the capital budgeting and purchasing cycles of our end users since our working capital needs peak during periods in which we are increasing production in anticipation of orders that have not yet been received our results of operations will fluctuate seasonally even if the forecasted demand for our products proves accurate furthermore it is difficult for us to evaluate the degree to which this seasonality may affect our business in future periods because of the rate and unpredictability of product transitions and new product introductions particularly in the client noncompute market as well as macroeconomic conditions 

we have a long and unpredictable sales cycle for enterprise data storage solutions 

our enterprise data storage solutions are technically complex and we typically supply them in high quantities to a small number of customers many of our products are also tailored to meet the specific requirements of individual customers and are often integrated by our customers into the systems and products that they sell factors that affect the length of our sales cycle include 

 

  

  

 as a result our sales cycle for enterprise data storage solutions is often in excess of one year and the length of our sales cycle is frequently unpredictable in addition the emerging and evolving nature of the market for the products that we sell may lead prospective customers to postpone their purchasing decisions we invest resources and incur costs during this cycle that may not be recovered if we do not successfully conclude sales these factors lead to difficulty in matching revenues with expenses and to increased expenditures which together may adversely impact our results of operations 

 

we may be adversely affected by the loss of or reduced delayed or canceled purchases by one or more of our major customers 

some of our key customers account for a large portion of our disk drive revenue while we have longstanding relationships with many of our customers if any of our key customers were to significantly reduce their purchases from us our results of operations would be adversely affected while sales to major customers may vary from period to period a major customer that permanently discontinues or significantly reduces its relationship with us could be difficult to replace in line with industry practice new customers usually require that we pass a lengthy and rigorous qualification process at the customer’s cost accordingly it may be difficult or costly for us to attract new major customers additionally mergers acquisitions consolidations or other significant transactions involving our customers generally entail risks to our business if a significant transaction involving any of our key customers results in the loss of or reduction in purchases by these key customers it could have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and prospects 

we are dependent on sales to distributors and retailers which may increase price erosion and the volatility of our sales 

a substantial portion of our sales has been to distributors of disk drive products certain of our distributors may also market other products that compete with our products product qualification programs in this distribution channel are limited which increases the number of competing products that are available to satisfy demand particularly in times of lengthening product cycles as a result purchasing decisions in this channel are based largely on price terms and product availability sales volumes through this channel are also less predictable and subject to greater volatility than sales to our oem customers in addition deterioration in business and economic conditions could exacerbate price erosion and volatility as distributors lower prices to compensate for lower demand and higher inventory levels our distributors’ ability to access credit for purposes of funding their operations may also affect purchases of our products by these customers 

if distributors reduce their purchases of our products or prices decline significantly in the distribution channel or if distributors experience financial difficulties or terminate their relationships with us our revenues and results of operations would be adversely affected 

we believe that industry demand for storage products in the longterm is increasing due to the proliferation of mediarich digital content in consumer applications and is fueling increased consumer demand for storage this has led to the expansion of our branded solutions such as external storage products to provide additional storage capacity and to secure data in case of disaster or system failure or to provide independent storage solutions for multiple users in home or small business environments consumer spending on retail sales of our branded solutions has deteriorated in some markets and may continue to do so if poor global economic conditions continue and higher levels of unemployment persist this could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services and on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition such retail sales of our branded solutions traditionally experience seasonal variability in demand with higher levels of demand in the first half of our fiscal year driven by consumer spending in the backtoschool season from late summer to fall and the traditional holiday shopping season from fall to winter additionally our ability to reach such consumers depends on us maintaining effective working relationships with major retailers and distributors failure to anticipate consumer demand for our branded solutions as well as an inability to maintain effective working relationships with retail and online distributors may adversely impact our future results of operations 

our international sales and manufacturing operations subject us to risks related to disruptions in foreign markets currency exchange fluctuations longer payment cycles seasonality limitations imposed by a variety of legal and regulatory regimes potential adverse tax consequences increased costs our customers’ credit and access to capital healthrelated risks and access to personnel 

we have significant sales and manufacturing operations in foreign countries including manufacturing facilities sales personnel and customer support operations we have manufacturing facilities in china malaysia northern ireland singapore and thailand in addition to those in the united states additionally the manufacturing of some of our products is concentrated in certain geographical locations the production of certain drive subassemblies are limited to thailand and the production of media is limited to singapore disruptions in the economic environmental political legal or regulatory landscape in these countries may have a material adverse impact on our manufacturing operations 

 

our international operations are subject to economic risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we could suffer a loss of revenue and increased costs exposure to significant liability including legal and regulatory consequences reputational harm and other serious negative consequences if we encounter cyberattacks ransomware or other data security breaches that disrupt our operations or result in the dissemination of proprietary or confidential information about us or our customers or other thirdparties 

our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer equipment and the electronic data stored in our databases from damage by among other things earthquake floods fire natural disasters accidents power disruptions telecommunications failures acts of terrorism or war employee misconduct physical or electronic breakins cyberattacks ransomware system security breaches or similar events or disruptions we manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our operations in addition our outsourcing services and cloud computing businesses routinely process store and transmit large amounts of data for our customers and vendors including sensitive and personally identifiable information as our operations become more automated and increasingly interdependent our exposure to the risks posed by these types of events will increase we have been and will likely continue to be subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes cyberattacks or other computerrelated attempts to breach the information technology “it” systems we use for these purposes we may also be subject to it system failures and network disruptions due to these factors experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of thirdparties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products in addition sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from thirdparties may contain defects in design or manufacture including “bugs” and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system 

the costs to us to eliminate or address the foregoing security problems and security vulnerabilities before or after a cyberincident could be significant system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions we could lose existing or potential customers for outsourcing services or other it solutions in connection with any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products in addition breaches of our security measures and the unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers or other thirdparties could expose us our vendors and customers or other thirdparties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business in addition we rely in certain limited capacities on thirdparty data management providers whose possible security problems and security vulnerabilities may have similar effects on us 

 

we are subject to laws rules and regulations in the us uk european union and other countries relating to the collection use and security of user data in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries and among us our subsidiaries and other parties with which we have commercial relations our ability to execute transactions and to possess and use personal information and data in conducting our business subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens that may require us to notify vendors customers or employees of a data security breach we have incurred and will continue to incur significant expenses to comply with mandatory privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law regulation industry standards or contractual obligations these laws protocols and standards continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices if we fail to comply with applicable federal state or international privacyrelated or data protection laws we may be subject to proceedings by governmental entities and incur penalties or significant legal liability 

from time to time we may be subject to litigation government investigations or governmental proceedings which may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 

from time to time the company may be involved in various legal regulatory or administrative investigations negotiations or proceedings arising in the normal course of business 

in the event of litigation government investigations or governmental proceedings we are subject to the inherent risks and uncertainties that may result if outcomes differ from our expectations in the event of adverse outcomes in any litigation investigation or government proceeding we could be required to pay substantial damages fines or penalties and cease certain practices or activities which could materially harm our business 

the costs associated with litigation and government investigations can also be unpredictable depending on the complexity and length of time devoted to such litigation or investigation litigation investigations or government proceedings may also divert the efforts and attention of our key personnel which could also harm our business 

if we do not control our fixed costs we will not be able to compete effectively in our industry 

we continually seek to make our cost structure and business processes more efficient we are focused on increasing workforce flexibility and scalability and improving overall competitiveness by leveraging our global capabilities as well as external talent and skills worldwide our strategy involves to a substantial degree increasing revenue and product volume while at the same time controlling operating expenses if we do not control our operating expenses our ability to compete in the marketplace may be impaired in the past activities to reduce operating costs have included closures and transfers of facilities significant personnel reductions restructuring efforts and efforts to increase automation our restructuring efforts may not yield the intended benefits and may be unsuccessful or disruptive to our business operations which may materially adversely affect our financial results 

if we experience shortages or delays in the receipt of or cost increases in critical components equipment or raw materials necessary to manufacture our products we may suffer lower operating margins production delays and other material adverse effects 

the cost quality and supply of components subassemblies certain equipment and raw materials used to manufacture our products and key components like recording media and heads are critical to our success the equipment we use to manufacture our products and components is frequently custom made and comes from a few suppliers and the lead times required to obtain manufacturing equipment can be significant particularly important for our products include readwrite heads aluminum or glass substrates for recording media asics spindle motors printed circuit boards and suspension assemblies 

we rely on sole suppliers or a limited number of suppliers for some or all of these components that we do not manufacture including aluminum and glass substrates readwrite heads asics spindle motors printed circuit boards and suspension assemblies many of such component suppliers are geographically concentrated which makes our supply chain more vulnerable to regional disruptions such as severe weather acts of terrorism and unpredictable geopolitical climate which may have a material impact on the production and availability of many components if our vendors for these components are unable to meet our cost quality and supply requirements continue to remain financially viable or fulfill their contractual commitments and obligations we could experience a shortage in supply or an increase in production costs which would materially adversely affect our results of operations and our financial results 

certain rare earth elements are critical in the manufacture of our products we purchase components that contain rare earth elements from a number of countries including the people’s republic of china we cannot predict whether any nation will impose regulations quotas or embargoes upon the rare earth elements incorporated into our products that would restrict the worldwide supply of such metals or increase their cost we have experienced increased costs and production delays when we were unable to obtain the necessary equipment or sufficient quantities of some components andor have been forced to pay higher prices or make volume purchase commitments or advance deposits for some components equipment or raw materials that were in short supply in the industry in general if any major supplier were to restrict the supply available to us or increase the cost of the rare earth elements used in our products we could experience a shortage in supply or an increase in production costs which would adversely affect our results of operations 

 

consolidation among component manufacturers has resulted and may continue to result in some component manufacturers exiting the industry or not making sufficient investments in research to develop new components 

if there is a shortage of or delay in supplying us with critical components equipment or raw materials then 

 

  

  

  

 we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain critical components in a timely and economic manner 

we often aim to lead the market in new technology deployments and leverage unique and customized technology from single source suppliers who are early adopters in the emerging market our options in supplier selection in these cases are limited and the supplier based technology may consequently be single sourced until wider adoption of the technology occurs and any necessary licenses become available in such cases any technical issues in the supplier’s technology may cause us to delay shipments of our new technology deployments and therefore harm our financial position 

if revenues fall or customer demand decreases significantly we may not meet all of our purchase commitments to certain suppliers 

from time to time we enter into longterm noncancelable purchase commitments or make large upfront investments with certain suppliers in order to secure certain components or technologies for the production of our products or to supplement our internal manufacturing capacity for certain components if our actual revenues in the future are lower than our projections or if customer demand decreases significantly below our projections we may not meet all of our purchase commitments with these suppliers as a result it is possible that our revenues will not be sufficient to recoup our upfront investments in which case we will have to shift output from our internal manufacturing facilities to these suppliers or make penaltytype payments under these contracts 

conflict minerals regulations may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products 

in august 2012 the sec adopted rules establishing additional disclosure and reporting requirements regarding the use of specified minerals or conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured these rules will require us to determine disclose and report whether or not such conflict minerals originate from the democratic republic of the congo or an adjoining country these rules could affect our ability to source certain materials used in our products at competitive prices and could impact the availability of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products including gold tantalum tin and tungsten as there may be only a limited number of suppliers of “conflict free” minerals we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary conflict free minerals in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices our customers including our oem customers may require that our products be free of conflict minerals and our revenues and margins may be harmed if we are unable to procure conflict free minerals at a reasonable price or at all or are unable to pass through any increased costs associated with meeting these demands additionally we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of all minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement we may also face challenges with government regulators and our customers and suppliers if we are unable to sufficiently verify that the metals used in our products are conflict free we expect that there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements such as costs related to determining the source of certain minerals used in our products as well as costs related to possible changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification and disclosure requirements additionally the regulatory and compliance framework for conflict minerals may undergo changes which may further increase the cost of compliance our stakeholders and customers may place increased demands on our compliance framework which may in turn negatively impact our relationships with our suppliers 

 

the loss of key executive officers and employees could negatively impact our business prospects 

our future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued service of key members of management as well as marketing sales and product development personnel the loss of one or more of our key personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we believe our future success will also depend in large part upon our ability to attract retain and further motivate highly skilled management marketing sales and product development personnel we have experienced intense competition for personnel and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our key employees or that we will be successful in attracting assimilating and retaining personnel in the future 

due to the complexity of our products some defects may only become detectable after deployment 

our products are highly complex and are designed to operate in and form part of larger complex networks and storage systems defects in our products or in the networks and systems of which they form a part directly or indirectly have resulted in and may in the future result in 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 defects in our products could also result in legal actions by our customers for property damage injury or death product liability claims could exceed the level of insurance coverage that we have obtained to cover defects in our products any significant uninsured claims could significantly harm our financial condition 

political events war terrorism natural disasters public health issues and other circumstances could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

war terrorism geopolitical uncertainties natural disasters public health issues and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy and thus could have a strong negative effect on our business our suppliers logistics providers manufacturing vendors and customers our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes fires power shortages terrorist attacks other hostile acts labor disputes public health issues and other events beyond our control such events could decrease demand for our products make it difficult or impossible for us to make and deliver products to our customers or to receive components from our suppliers and create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain in the event of a natural disaster losses and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations and our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected should major public health issues including pandemics arise we could be negatively affected by stringent employee travel restrictions additional limitations in freight services governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in our operations and some of our key customers 

 

failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the sale and manufacturing of products in certain states and countries may subject us and our suppliers to state federal and international laws and regulations governing protection of the environment including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites restrictions on the presence of certain substances in electronic products and the responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling we endeavor to ensure that we and our suppliers comply with all applicable environmental laws and regulations however compliance may increase our operating costs and otherwise impact future financial results if additional or more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future we could incur additional operating costs and capital expenditures if we fail to comply with applicable environmental laws regulations initiatives or standards of conduct our customers may refuse to purchase our products and we could be subject to fines penalties and possible prohibition of sales of our products into one or more states or countries liability to our customers and damage to our reputation which could result in a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations 

any cost reduction initiatives that we undertake may not deliver the results we expect and these actions may adversely affect our business 

from time to time we engage in restructuring plans that may result in workforce reduction and consolidation of our real estate facilities and our manufacturing footprint in addition management will continue to evaluate our global footprint and cost structure and additional restructuring plans are expected to be formalized as a result of our restructuring we may experience a loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge disruptions to our operations andor inefficiency during transitional periods any costcutting measures could impact employee retention in addition we cannot be sure that the cost reduction and global footprint consolidation will be successful in reducing our overall expenses as we expect or that additional costs will not offset any such reductions or global footprint consolidation if our operating costs are higher than we expect or if we do not maintain adequate control of our costs and expenses our result of operations may suffer 

our ability to use our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards might be limited 

the use of a portion of our us net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards is subject to annual limitations pursuant to us tax law section 382 of the us internal revenue code generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards that might be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone significant changes in ownership as a result future changes in ownership could put further limitations on the availability of our net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards 

deterioration in global credit and financial market conditions could negatively impact the value of our current portfolio of cash equivalents or shortterm investments and our ability to meet our financing objectives 

our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase our shortterm investments consist primarily of readily marketable debt securities with remaining maturities of more than 90 days at the time of purchase our investment policy has as its principal objectives the preservation of principal and maintenance of liquidity we mitigate default risk by investing in highquality investment grade securities limiting the time to maturity and by monitoring the counterparties and underlying obligors closely 

while as of the date of this filing we are not aware of any material downgrades losses or other significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or shortterm investments no assurance can be given that future deterioration in conditions of the global credit and financial markets would not negatively impact our current portfolio of cash equivalents or shortterm investments or our ability to meet our financing objectives 

we are at times subject to intellectual property legal proceedings and claims which could cause us to incur significant additional costs or prevent us from selling our products and which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject from timetotime to legal proceedings and claims including claims of alleged infringement of the patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties by us or our customers in connection with their use of our products intellectual property litigation can be expensive and timeconsuming regardless of the merits of any claim and could divert our management’s attention from operating our business in addition intellectual property lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties due to the complexity of the technical issues involved which may cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations patent litigation has increased due to the current uncertainty of the law and the increasing competition and overlap of product functionality in the field some of the actions that we face from timetotime seek injunctions against the sale of our products andor substantial monetary damages which if granted or awarded could materially harm our business financial condition and operating results 

 

we cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of others we may not be aware of currently filed patent applications that relate to our products or technology if patents are later issued on these applications we may be liable for infringement if our products were found to infringe the intellectual property rights of others we could be required to pay substantial damages cease the manufacture use and sale of infringing products in one or more geographic locations expend significant resources to develop noninfringing technology discontinue the use of specific processes or obtain licenses to the technology infringed we might not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms or at all or be able to reengineer our products successfully to avoid infringement any of the foregoing could cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling our products which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary datanote 14 legal environmental and other contingencies” contained in this report for a description of pending intellectual property proceedings 

we may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect our ip rights in the past we have been involved in significant and expensive disputes regarding our ip rights and those of others including claims that we may be infringing patents trademarks and other ip rights of thirdparties we expect that we will be involved in similar disputes in the future 

there can be no assurance that 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition our competitors may be able to design their products around our patents and other proprietary rights enforcement of our rights often requires litigation if we bring a patent infringement action and are not successful our competitors would be able to use similar technology to compete with us moreover the defendant in such an action may successfully countersue us for infringement of their patents or assert a counterclaim that our patents are invalid or unenforceable 

furthermore we have significant operations and sales in foreign countries where intellectual property laws and enforcement policies are often less developed less stringent or more difficult to enforce than in the united states 

the price of our ordinary shares may be volatile and could decline significantly 

the stock market in general and the market for technology stocks in particular has recently experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of companies if these market or industrybased fluctuations continue the trading price of our ordinary shares could decline significantly independent of our actual operating performance and you could lose all or a substantial part of your investment the market price of our ordinary shares could fluctuate significantly in response to several factors including among others 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any decision to reduce or discontinue the payment of cash dividends to our shareholders or the repurchase of our ordinary shares pursuant to our previously announced share repurchase program could cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline significantly 

although we have announced targeted regular cash dividend amounts and a share repurchase program we are under no obligation to pay cash dividends to our shareholders in the future at the announced targeted levels or at all or to repurchase our ordinary shares at any particular price or at all the declaration and payment of any future dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and our previously announced share repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time our payment of quarterly cash dividends and the repurchase of our ordinary shares pursuant to our share repurchase program are subject to among other things our financial position and results of operations available cash and cash flow capital and regulatory requirements market and economic conditions our ordinary share price and other factors any reduction or discontinuance by us of the payment of quarterly cash dividends or the repurchase of our ordinary shares pursuant to our share repurchase program could cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline significantly moreover in the event our payment of quarterly cash dividends or repurchases of our ordinary shares are reduced or discontinued our failure to resume such activities at historical levels could result in a persistent lower market valuation of our ordinary shares 

significant fluctuations in the market price of our ordinary shares could result in securities class action claims against us 

significant price and value fluctuations have occurred with respect to the publicly traded securities of technology companies the price of our ordinary shares is likely to be volatile in the future in the past following periods of decline in the market price of a company’s securities class action lawsuits have often been pursued against that company if similar litigation were pursued against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity

our company 

we are a leading provider of data storage technology and solutions our principal products are hard disk drives commonly referred to as disk drives hard drives or hdds in addition to hdds we produce a broad range of data storage products including solid state drives “ssd” and their related controllers solid state hybrid drives “sshd” and storage subsystems 

hard disk drives are devices that store digitally encoded data on rapidly rotating disks with magnetic surfaces disk drives continue to be the primary medium of mass data storage due to their performance attributes high quality and cost effectiveness complementing existing data center storage architecture solidstate storage devices use integrated circuit assemblies as memory to store data and most ssds use nandbased flash memory in addition to hdds and ssds sshds combine the features of ssds and hdds in the same unit containing a large hard disk drive and an ssd cache to improve performance of frequently accessed data 

our products are designed for mission critical and nearline applications in enterprise servers and storage systems client compute applications where our products are designed primarily for desktop and mobile computing and client noncompute applications where our products are designed for a wide variety of end user devices such as portable external storage systems surveillance systems networkattached storage “nas” digital video recorders “dvrs” and gaming consoles 

our cloud systems and solutions extend innovation from the device into the information infrastructure onsite and in the cloud our portfolio includes modular original equipment manufacturer “oem” storage systems and scaleout storage servers 

business overview 

our industry is characterized by several trends and factors that have a material impact on our strategic planning financial condition and results of operations 

demand for data storage 

the continued advancement of the cloud the proliferation of a variety of mobile devices globally development of the internet of things “iot” increasingly pervasive use of video surveillance evolution of consumer electronic devices and enterprise use of big data analytics are driving the growth of digital content factors contributing to the growth of digital content include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result of these factors the nature and volume of content being created requires greater storage which is more efficiently and economically facilitated by higher capacity storage devices in order to store manage distribute analyze and backup such content we expect this to support the growth in demand for data storage solutions in developed and emerging economies well into the future 

the amount of data created as well as where and how data is stored continues to evolve with the proliferation of mobile devices the growth of cloud computing and the evolving iot in addition the economics of storage infrastructure are also evolving with the utilization of public and private hyperscale storage and opensource solutions reducing the total cost of ownership of storage while increasing the speed and efficiency with which customers can leverage massive computing and storage devices accordingly we expect these trends will continue to create significant demand for data storage solutions going forward 

demand trends for disk drives 

we believe that continued growth in digital content requires increasingly higher storage capacity in order to store aggregate host distribute analyze manage backup and use such content we also believe that as architectures evolve to serve the growing commercial and consumer user base throughout the world the manner in which hard drives are delivered to market and utilized by our customers will evolve as well 

 

we believe that in the foreseeable future the traditional enterprise and client compute markets that require highcapacity storage solutions and the data intensive client noncompute markets will continue to be best served by hard disk drives due to the industry’s ability to deliver the most cost effective reliable and energy efficient mass storage devices although the advance of solid state technology in the above markets is expected to increase as well furthermore the increased use of client noncompute devices that both consume mediarich digital content streamed from the cloud and create rich digital content that is stored in the cloud increases the demand for high capacity hard disk drives in enterprise nearline applications 

we also believe that as hard disk drive capacities continue to increase unit demand does not reflect the increase in exabytes demand in recent years this trend has resulted in demand for fewer units but with higher average capacity per drive 

industry supply balance 

from time to time the hdd industry has experienced periods of imbalance between supply and demand to the extent that the disk drive industry builds or maintains capacity based on expectations of demand that do not materialize price erosion may become more pronounced conversely during periods where demand exceeds supply price erosion is generally muted 

price erosion 

historically our industry has been characterized by price declines for disk drive products with comparable capacity performance and feature sets “likeforlike products” price declines for likeforlike products “price erosion” tend to be more pronounced during periods of 

 

  

  

 disk drive manufacturers typically attempt to offset price erosion with an improved mix of disk drive products characterized by higher capacity better performance and additional feature sets and product cost reductions 

we believe the hdd industry experienced modest price erosion in fiscal years 2015 2016 and 2017 

product life cycles and changing technology 

success in our industry has been dependent to a large extent on the ability to balance the introduction and transition of new products with timetovolume performance capacity and quality metrics at a competitive price level of service and support that our customers expect generally the drive manufacturer that introduces a new product first benefits from improved product mix favorable profit margins and less pricing pressure until comparable products are introduced changing technology also necessitates ongoing investments in research and development which may be difficult to recover due to rapid product life cycles and economic declines further there is a continued need to successfully execute product transitions and new product introductions as factors such as quality reliability and manufacturing yields continue to be of significant competitive importance 

seasonality 

the disk drive industry traditionally experiences seasonal variability in demand with higher levels of demand in the second half of the calendar year this seasonality is driven by consumer spending in the backtoschool season from late summer to fall and the traditional holiday shopping season from fall to winter we believe fiscal year 2015 reflected seasonality consistent with historical patterns in fiscal year 2016 beyond traditional seasonality variability of sales was a reflection of more cyclical demand from csps based on the timing of large systems installations and the shift of the underlying technology we believe fiscal year 2017 reflected seasonality consistent with historical patterns 

fiscal year 2017 summary 

during the fiscal year 2017 we shipped 263 exabytes generating revenue of 108 billion and gross margins of 29 our operating cash flow was 19 billion we repurchased approximately 12 million of our ordinary shares during the year for approximately 460 million we issued 750 million of 425 senior notes due 2022 and 500 million of 4875 senior notes due 2024 and paid 316 million for the redemption and repurchase of our outstanding debt as well as paid 561 million in dividends in fiscal year 2017 

 

results of operations 

we list in the tables below summarized information from our consolidated statements of operations by dollars and as a percentage of revenue 

 

  

  

the following table summarizes hdd information regarding average drive selling prices “asps” exabytes shipped and revenues by channel and geography 

 

 fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 

revenue 

 

 revenue in fiscal year 2017 decreased approximately 3 or 04 billion from fiscal year 2016 as a result of price erosion partially offset by an increase in exabytes shipped 

cost of revenue and gross margin 

 

 for fiscal year 2017 gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased by 600 basis points compared to the prior fiscal year due to a favorable product mix and improved factory utilization resulting from cost savings due to our ongoing workforce reductions and manufacturing consolidation activities partially offset by price erosion 

operating expenses 

 

  

product development expense product development expenses for fiscal year 2017 decreased from fiscal year 2016 primarily due to a 102 million decrease in salaries and related benefits as a result of an increase in operational efficiencies in our business and the restructuring of our workforce in the prior periods offset by a 71 million increase in variable compensation and sharebased compensation driven by better financial performance and a 26 million increase in impairment charges related to the closure of our korea design center 

marketing and administrative expense marketing and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2017 decreased from fiscal year 2016 primarily due to a decrease in salaries and related benefits of 52 million as a result of the restructuring of our workforce in prior periods a 28 million cost reduction resulting from an increase in operational efficiencies in our business and the completion of certain promotional and branding activities in fiscal year 2016 partially offset by a 51 million increase in variable compensation and sharebased compensation driven by better financial performance 

amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles for fiscal year 2017 decreased by 19 million as compared to fiscal year 2016 due to certain intangible assets reaching the end of their useful life 

restructuring and other net restructuring and other net for fiscal year 2017 was comprised primarily of restructuring charges recorded during the september 2016 quarter and march 2017 quarter to reduce our workforce by approximately 6800 employees as we continue to consolidate our global footprint across asia emea and the americas 

restructuring and other net for fiscal year 2016 comprised of restructuring charges recorded during the september 2015 quarter march 2016 quarter and june 2016 quarter to reduce our workforce by approximately 4600 employees and align our manufacturing footprint with current macroeconomic conditions 

other expense net 

 

 other expense net for fiscal year 2017 increased by 68 million as compared to fiscal year 2016 primarily due to the 33 million of other income associated with the final payment of unpaid interest on the arbitration award amount in the company’s case against western digital in fiscal year 2016 which did not recur in fiscal year 2017 a 12 million increase from impairment of certain strategic investments and 24 million interest expense on the issuance of 750 million of 425 senior notes due 2022 and 500 million of 4875 senior notes due 2024 

income taxes 

 

 we recorded an income tax provision of 43 million for fiscal year 2017 compared to an income tax provision of 26 million for fiscal year 2016 our fiscal year 2017 income tax provision included approximately 2 million of net tax expense associated with various nonrecurring items our fiscal year 2016 income tax provision included approximately 22 million of income tax benefits primarily associated with the release of tax reserves due to the expiration of certain statutes of limitation 

our irish tax resident parent holding company owns various us and nonus subsidiaries that operate in multiple nonirish income tax jurisdictions our worldwide operating income is either subject to varying rates of income tax or is exempt from income tax due to tax holiday programs we operate under in malaysia singapore and thailand these tax holidays are scheduled to expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2024 

our income tax provision recorded for fiscal year 2017 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying the irish statutory rate of 25 to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i tax benefits related to nonus earnings generated in jurisdictions that are subject to tax holidays or tax incentive programs and are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of ireland ii a decrease in valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets and iii permanent differences our income tax provision recorded for fiscal year 2016 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying the irish statutory rate of 25 to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i tax benefits related to nonus earnings generated in jurisdictions that are subject to tax holidays or tax incentive programs and are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of ireland ii tax benefits associated with the reversal of previously recorded taxes and iii a decrease in valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets the acquisition of dot hill system corporation did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate 

 

based on our nonus ownership structure and subject to i potential future increases in our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and ii a future change in our intention to indefinitely reinvest earnings from our subsidiaries outside of ireland we anticipate that our effective tax rate in future periods will generally be less than the irish statutory rate 

at june 30 2017 our deferred tax asset valuation allowance was approximately 966 million 

at june 30 2017 we had net deferred tax assets of 602 million excluding 2 million of deferred taxes on intraentity transactions the realization of most of these deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on our ability to generate sufficient us and certain nonus taxable income in future periods although realization is not assured we believe that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable however may increase or decrease in subsequent periods when we reevaluate the underlying basis for our estimates of future us and certain nonus taxable income 

as of june 30 2017 approximately 560 million and 101 million of our total us net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards respectively are subject to annual limitations from 1 million to 45 million pursuant to us tax law 

we are required to file us federal us state and nonus income tax returns we are no longer subject to tax examination of us federal income tax returns for years prior to fiscal year 2014 with respect to us state and nonus income tax returns we are generally no longer subject to tax examination for years ending prior to fiscal year 2006 

fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 

revenue 

 

 revenue in fiscal year 2016 decreased approximately 19 or 26 billion from fiscal year 2015 as a result of price erosion and a decrease in exabytes shipped in the client compute market 

cost of revenue and gross margin 

 

 for fiscal year 2016 gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased by 500 basis points compared to the prior fiscal year due to price erosion and reduced demand in legacy hard drives resulting in underutilization of certain factories partially offset by improved product mix in the second half of fiscal year 2016 

 

operating expenses 

 

 product development expense product development expenses for fiscal year 2016 decreased from fiscal year 2015 due to a decrease in salaries and other employee benefits of 63 million as a result of the restructuring of our workforce beginning in the second half of fiscal year 2015 a 29 million decrease in variable compensation and other cost reduction efforts partially offset by the consolidation of dot hill in fiscal year 2016 and lsi’s flash business in fiscal year 2015 

marketing and administrative expense marketing and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2016 decreased from fiscal year 2015 primarily due to a decrease in salaries and other employee benefits of 82 million as a result of a restructuring of our workforce beginning in the second half of fiscal year 2015 a 45 million decrease in variable compensation and sharebased compensation a 33 million reduction in advertising due to the completion of certain promotional and branding activities in fiscal year 2016 and increased operational efficiencies in our business 

amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles for fiscal year 2016 decreased by 6 million as compared to fiscal year 2015 as a result of certain intangible assets reaching the end of their useful lives partially offset by the amortization of intangibles acquired from the dot hill acquisition in fiscal 2016 

restructuring and other net restructuring and other net for fiscal year 2016 was comprised of restructuring charges recorded during the september 2015 quarter march 2016 quarter and june 2016 quarter to reduce our workforce by approximately 4600 employees and align our manufacturing footprint with current macroeconomic conditions restructuring and other net for fiscal year 2015 was due to charges to reduce our workforce as a result of our ongoing focus on cost efficiencies in all areas of our business 

gain on arbitration award net gain on arbitration award net for fiscal year 2015 was related to the final award amount of 630 million less litigation and other related costs of 10 million in the company’s case against western digital for the misappropriation of the company’s trade secrets 

other expense net 

 

 other expense net for fiscal year 2016 increased by 83 million as compared to fiscal year 2015 primarily due to the absence of partial receipt of 143 million for interest accrued on the final arbitration award amount in the company’s case against western digital in fiscal year 2015 compared to 33 million in fiscal year 2016 and a 33 million change in foreign currency remeasurement related to net gains and losses from changes in foreign exchange rates which were more pronounced in the prior year partially offset by 74 million of losses from the early redemptions and repurchases of debt in fiscal year 2015 compared to a 3 million gain from the early redemptions and repurchases of debt in fiscal year 2016

liquidity and capital resources 

the following sections discuss our principal liquidity requirements as well as our sources and uses of cash and our liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase our shortterm investments consist primarily of money market funds time deposits and certificates of deposit the principal objectives of our investment policy are the preservation of principal and maintenance of liquidity we believe our cash equivalents and shortterm investments are liquid and accessible we operate in some countries that have restrictive regulations over the movement of cash andor foreign exchange across their borders however we believe our sources of cash have been and will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the next 12 months we are not aware of any downgrades losses or other significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or shortterm investments and we do not believe the fair value of our shortterm investments has significantly changed from the values reported as of june 30 2017 

cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

 

  

our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments increased by 1408 million from july 1 2016 as a result of net cash provided by operating activities and the proceeds from the issuance of 750 million of 425 senior notes due 2022 and 500 million of 4875 senior notes due 2024 these cash inflows were partially offset by net cash outflows for capital expenditures of 434 million dividends paid to our shareholders of 561 million repurchase of our ordinary shares of 460 million and early redemption and repurchase of debt of 316 million the following table summarizes results from the statement of cash flows for the periods indicated

 net cash used in financing activities of 18 billion for fiscal year 2016 was primarily attributable to the following activities 

 

  

 net cash used in financing activities of 15 billion for fiscal year 2015 was primarily attributable to the following activities 

 

  

  

  

 liquidity sources 

our primary sources of liquidity as of june 30 2017 consisted of 1 approximately 25 billion in cash and cash equivalents 2 a 700 million senior revolving credit facility and 3 cash we expect to generate from operations 

as of june 30 2017 no borrowings had been drawn under the revolving credit facility or had been utilized for letters of credit issued under this credit facility the line of credit is available for borrowings through january 15 2020 subject to compliance with financial covenants other customary conditions to borrowing and investment grade ratings if the company does not have investment grade ratings as defined in the revolving credit facility on august 15 2018 then the maturity date will be august 16 2018 unless certain extension conditions have been satisfied 

the credit agreement that governs our revolving credit facility as amended contains certain covenants that we must satisfy in order to remain in compliance with the credit agreement as amended the agreement includes three financial covenants 1 minimum cash cash equivalents and marketable securities 2 a fixed charge coverage ratio and 3 a net leverage ratio on april 28 2016 the revolving credit agreement was amended in order to increase the allowable net leverage ratio to adjust for our current financial liquidity position we were in compliance with the modified covenants as of june 30 2017 and expect to be in compliance for the next 12 months 

as of june 30 2017 cash and cash equivalents held by nonirish subsidiaries was 25 billion this amount is potentially subject to taxation in ireland upon repatriation by means of a dividend into our irish parent however it is our intent to indefinitely reinvest earnings of nonirish subsidiaries outside of ireland and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate such earnings by means of a taxable irish dividend should funds be needed in the irish parent company and should we be unable to fund parent company activities through means other than a taxable irish dividend we would be required to accrue and pay irish taxes on such dividend 

we believe that our sources of cash will be sufficient to fund our operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months 

cash requirements and commitments 

our liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital product development and capital expenditure needs to fund scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness and to fund our quarterly dividend our ability to fund these requirements will depend on our future cash flows which are determined by future operating performance and therefore subject to prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and financial business and other factors some of which are beyond our control 

on july 25 2017 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 063 per share which will be payable on october 4 2017 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on september 20 2017 

as of june 30 2017 we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our debt agreements based on our current outlook we expect to be in compliance with the covenants of our debt agreements over the next 12 months 

 

the carrying value of our longterm debt as of june 30 2017 and july 1 2016 was 50 billion and 41 billion respectively the table below presents the principal amounts of our outstanding longterm debt 

 

 from time to time we may repurchase any of our outstanding ordinary shares through private open market tender offers broker assisted purchases or other means during fiscal year 2017 we repurchased approximately 13 million of our ordinary shares including statutory tax withholdings related to vesting of employee equity awards see “item 5 market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securitiesrepurchases of our equity securities” as of june 30 2017 13 billion remained available for repurchase under our existing repurchase authorization limit all repurchases are effected as redemptions in accordance with the company’s articles of association 

for fiscal year 2018 we expect capital expenditures to be less than 5 of revenue we require substantial amounts of cash to fund any increased working capital requirements future capital expenditures scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness and payments of dividends we will continue to evaluate and manage the retirement and replacement of existing debt and associated obligations including evaluating the issuance of new debt securities exchanging existing debt securities for other debt securities and retiring debt pursuant to privately negotiated transactions open market purchases tender offers or other means or otherwise in addition we may selectively pursue strategic alliances acquisitions and investments which may require additional capital 

contractual obligations and commitments 

our contractual cash obligations and commitments as of june 30 2017 have been summarized in the table below 

 

  

    

as of june 30 2017 we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits and an accrual for the payment of related interest totaling 15 million none of which is expected to be settled within one year outside of one year we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlement with a taxing authority will occur 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of june 30 2017 we did not have any material offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of regulation sk 

accounting policies 

the methods estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements the sec has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are highly uncertain at the time of estimation based on this definition our most critical policies include establishment of sales program accruals establishment of warranty accruals accounting for income taxes and the accounting for goodwill and other longlived assets below we discuss these policies further as well as the estimates and judgments involved we also have other accounting policies and accounting estimates relating to uncollectible customer accounts valuation of inventory valuation of sharebased payments and restructuring we believe that these other accounting policies and accounting estimates either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective or it is less likely that they would have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period 

establishment of sales program accruals we establish certain distributor and oem sales programs aimed at increasing customer demand for oem sales rebates are typically based on an oem customer’s volume of purchases or other agreed upon rebate programs for the distribution channel these programs typically involve rebates related to a distributor’s level of sales order size advertising or point of sale activity and price protection adjustments we provide for these obligations at the time that revenue is recorded based on estimated requirements we estimate these contrarevenue rebates and adjustments based on various factors including price reductions during the period reported estimated future price erosion customer orders distributor sellthrough and inventory levels program participation customer claim submittals and sales returns our estimates reflect contractual arrangements but also our judgment relating to variables such as customer claim rates and attainment of program goals and inventory and sellthrough levels reported by our distribution customers currently our distributors’ inventories are within the historical range 

while we believe we have sufficient experience and knowledge of the market and customer buying patterns to reasonably estimate such rebates and adjustments actual market conditions or customer behavior could differ from our expectations as a result actual payments under these programs which may spread over several months after the related sale may vary from the amount accrued accordingly revenues and margins in the period in which the adjustment occurs may be affected 

significant actual variations in any of the factors upon which we base our contrarevenue estimates could have a material effect on our operating results in fiscal year 2017 sales programs were approximately 11 of gross revenue for fiscal years 2016 and 2015 total sales programs of gross revenues were 13 and 10 respectively adjustments to revenues due to under or over accruals for sales programs related to revenues reported in prior quarterly periods were less than 1 of gross revenue in fiscal years 2017 2016 and 2015 any future shifts in the industry supplydemand balance as well as other factors may result in a more competitive pricing environment and may cause sales programs as a percentage of gross revenue to increase from the current or historical levels if such rebates and incentives trend upwards revenues and margins may be reduced 

establishment of warranty accruals we estimate probable product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized we generally warrant our products for a period of 1 to 5 years our warranty provision considers estimated product failure rates and trends including the timing of product returns during the warranty periods and estimated repair or replacement costs related to product quality issues if any we also exercise judgment in estimating our ability to sell certain repaired products should actual experience in any future period differ significantly from our estimates our future results of operations could be materially affected our judgment is subject to a greater degree of subjectivity with respect to newly introduced products because of limited experience with those products upon which to base our warranty estimates 

 

the actual results with regard to warranty expenditures could have an adverse or favorable effect on our results of operations if the actual rate of unit failure the cost to repair a unit or the actual cost required to satisfy customer claims differs from those estimates we used in determining the warranty accrual since we typically outsource our warranty repairs our repair cost is subject to periodic negotiations with vendors and may vary from our estimates we also exercise judgment in estimating our ability to sell certain repaired products to the extent such sales fall below our forecast warranty cost will be adversely impacted 

we review our warranty accrual quarterly for products shipped in prior periods and which are still under warranty any changes in the estimates underlying the accrual may result in adjustments that impact the current period gross margins and net income in fiscal years 2017 2016 and 2015 net changes in estimates of prior warranty accruals as a percentage of revenue were immaterial our total warranty cost was 13 10 and 11 of revenue during fiscal years 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively while warranty cost related to new shipments exclusive of the impact of reestimates of preexisting liabilities were 12 11 and 11 respectively for the same periods changes in anticipated failure rates of specific products and significant changes in repair or replacement costs have historically been the major reasons for significant changes in prior estimates any future changes in failure rates of certain products as well as changes in repair costs or the cost of replacement parts may result in increased or decreased warranty accruals 

accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes pursuant to accounting standards codification “asc” topic 740 “asc 740” income taxes  in applying asc 740 we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits recognition of income and deductions and calculation of specific tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions the calculation of tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the internal revenue service or other tax jurisdictions if estimates of these tax liabilities are greater or less than actual results an additional tax benefit or provision will result the deferred tax assets we record each period depend primarily on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states and certain nonus jurisdictions each period we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and if necessary we adjust the valuation allowance so that net deferred tax assets are recorded only to the extent we conclude it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized if our outlook for future taxable income changes significantly our assessment of the need for a valuation allowance may also change 

assessing goodwill and other longlived assets for impairment we account for goodwill in accordance with asc topic 350 intangibles—goodwill and other  as permitted by asc 350 we perform a qualitative assessment in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist to determine if any events or circumstances exist such as an adverse change in business climate or a decline in the overall industry that would indicate that it would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount based on the qualitative assessment if it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then the company is not required to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test if it is determined in the qualitative assessment that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not below its carrying amount including goodwill then we perform a quantitative impairment test the quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount any excess in the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill over its fair value is recognized as an impairment loss limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 

in accordance with asc 360054 impairment or disposal of longlived assets we test other longlived assets including property equipment and leasehold improvements and other intangible assets subject to amortization for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of those assets may not be recoverable we assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable we will estimate the fair value of the asset group and compare it to its carrying value the excess of the carrying value over the fair value is allocated pro rata to derive the adjusted carrying value of each asset in the asset group the adjusted carrying value of each asset in the asset group is not reduced below its fair value

industry overview 

electronic data storage industry 

the electronic data storage industry is comprised of companies that manufacture components or subcomponents designed for electronic data storage devices and companies that provide storage solutions software and services for enterprise cloud big data and computing platforms 

markets 

the principal markets served by the electronic data storage industry are 

enterprise storage we define enterprise storage as dedicated storage area networks and hyperscale cloud storage environments enterprise data centers run solutions which are designed for mission critical performance and nearline high capacity applications 

mission critical applications are defined as those that are vital to the operation of largescale enterprise work loads requiring high performance and high reliability storage solutions we expect the market for mission critical enterprise storage solutions to continue to be driven by enterprises utilizing dedicated storage area networks our storage solutions are comprised principally of high performance enterprise class disk drives with sophisticated firmware and communications technologies 

nearline applications are defined as those which require high capacity and energy efficient storage solutions we expect such applications which include storage for cloud computing content delivery and backup services will continue to grow and drive demand for solutions designed with these attributes with the increased requirements for storage driven by the creation and consumption of mediarich digital 

content we expect the increased exabyte demand will require further buildout of data centers by cloud service providers and other enterprises which utilize high capacity nearline devices 

enterprise sas ssds are designed to deliver superior performance reliability and enterprise features to meet the demands of iointensive applications with potential for substantial power savings pcie accelerator cards are designed to optimize enterprise applications with a persistent highperformance highcapacity memory design accelerated flash also targets flash and software to accelerate any server virtualized deployment and moves any big data to the realm of real time from industry solutions perspective pcie cards are changing the storage architecture in many industries including the financial sector government telecommunications and media and entertainment 

client compute we define client compute applications as solutions designed for desktop and mobile compute applications ranging from traditional laptops tablets and convertible systems we believe that the demand resulting from the proliferation of digital content will continue to maintain demand for the client compute market as the storage of digital content in the cloud becomes more prominent and accessible some client compute applications rely less on builtin storage which is supplemented by cloud computing solutions and branded external hard drives 

client noncompute we define client noncompute applications as solutions designed for consumer electronic devices and disk drives used for external storage and network attached storage nas disk drives designed for consumer electronic devices are primarily used in applications such as dvrs and surveillance systems that require a higher capacity low costpergigabyte storage solution disk drives for external storage and nas devices are designed for purposes such as personal data backup and portable external storage and to augment storage capacity in the consumers current desktop notebook tablet or dvr devices we believe the proliferation and personal creation of mediarich digital content will continue to create increasing consumer demand for higher capacity storage solutions 

cloud systems and solutions we define cloud systems and solutions as applications that provide cloud based solutions to businesses for the purpose of hpc scaleout storage solutions and modular systems systems can contain hdds and ssds and can offer file management systems software and even compute power

storage services companies that provide and host services and solutions which include storage backup archiving recovery and discovery of electronic data 

hyperscale data centers increasingly large hyperscale data center companies are designing their own storage subsystems and having those built by contract manufacturers for use inside their own data centers this trend is reshaping the storage system and subsystem market and driving innovation in system design and changes in the competitive landscape of the large storage system vendors 

demand for electronic data storage 

the continued advancement of the cloud the proliferation of a variety of mobile devices globally development of the internet of things iot increasingly pervasive use of video surveillance evolution of consumer electronic devices and enterprise use of big data analytics are driving the growth of digital content factors contributing to this growth include 

• creation sharing and consumption of mediarich digital content such as highresolution photos high definition video and digital music through smart phones tablets digital cameras personal video cameras dvrs gaming consoles or other digital devices • creation aggregation and distribution of digital content through services and other offerings such as facebook® instagram® itunes® netflix® google® and youtube® • new surveillance systems which feature higher resolution digital cameras and thus require larger data storage capacities • creation and collection of data through the evolution of the iot ecosystem big data analytics and new technology trends such as selfdriving cars and drones • build out of large numbers of cloud data centers by cloud service providers and private companies transitioning onsite data centers into the cloud • protection of increased digital content through redundant storage on backup devices and externally provided storage services as a result of these factors the nature and volume of content being created requires greater storage which is more efficiently and economically facilitated by higher capacity storage devices in order to store manage distribute analyze and backup such content we expect this to support the growth in demand for electronic data storage solutions in developed and emerging economies well into the future 

the amount of data created as well as where and how data is stored continues to evolve with the proliferation of mobile devices the growth of cloud computing and the evolving iot in addition the economics of storage infrastructure are also evolving with the utilization of public and private hyperscale storage and opensource solutions reducing the total cost of ownership of storage while increasing the speed and efficiency with which customers can leverage massive computing and storage devices accordingly we expect these trends will continue to create significant demand for electronic data storage solutions going forward 

demand trends for disk drives 

we believe that continued growth in digital content requires increasingly higher storage capacity in order to store aggregate host distribute analyze manage backup and use such content we also believe that as architectures evolve to serve the growing commercial and consumer user base throughout the world the manner which hard drives are delivered to market and utilized by our customers will evolve as well 

we believe that in the foreseeable future the traditional enterprise and client compute markets that require high capacity storage solutions and the data intensive client noncompute markets will continue to be best served by hard disk drives due to the industrys ability to deliver the most cost effective reliable and energy efficient mass storage devices furthermore the increased use of client noncompute devices that both consume mediarich digital content streamed from the cloud and create rich digital content that is stored in the cloud increases the demand for high capacity hard disk drives in enterprise nearline applications 

we also believe that as hard disk drive capacities continue to increase unit demand does not reflect the increase in exabytes demand in recent years this trend has resulted in demand for fewer units but with higher average capacity per drive 

industry supply balance 

from time to time the hdd industry has experienced periods of imbalance between supply and demand to the extent that the disk drive industry builds or maintains capacity based on expectations of demand that do not materialize price erosion may become more pronounced conversely during periods where demand exceeds supply price erosion is generally muted 

our business 

disk drive technology 

the design and manufacturing of disk drives depends on highly advanced technology and manufacturing techniques and therefore requires high levels of research and development spending and capital equipment investments we design fabricate and assemble a number of the most important components found in our disk drives including readwrite heads and recording media our design and manufacturing operations are based on technology platforms that are used to produce various disk drive products that serve multiple data storage applications and markets our core technology platforms are focused around the areal density of media and readwrite head technologies using an integrated platform design and manufacturing leverage approach allows us to deliver a portfolio of disk drive products to service a wide range of electronic data storage applications and industries 

disk drives that we manufacture are commonly differentiated by the following key characteristics 

• storage capacity commonly expressed in gigabytes gb or terabytes tb which is the amount of data that can be stored on the disk drive • spindle rotation speed commonly expressed in revolutions per minute rpm which has an effect on speed of access to data • interface transfer rate commonly expressed in megabytes per second which is the rate at which data moves between the disk drive and the computer controller • average seek time commonly expressed in milliseconds which is the time needed to position the heads over a selected track on the disk surface • data transfer rate commonly expressed in megabytes per second which is the rate at which data is transferred to and from the disk drive • inputoutput operations per second iops commonly expressed in megabytes per second which is the maximum number of reads and writes to a storage location • product quality and reliability commonly expressed in annualized return rates and • energy efficiency commonly measured by the power output necessary to operate the disk drive areal density is a measure of storage capacity per square inch on the recording surface of a disk the storage capacity of a disk drive is determined by the number of disks it contains as well as the areal density capability of these disks we have been pursuing and will continue to pursue a number of technologies to increase areal densities across the entire range of our products for expanding disk drive capacities and reducing the number of disks and heads per drive to further reduce product costs 

manufacturing 

we design and produce our own readwrite heads and recording media which are critical technologies for disk drives this integrated approach enables us to lower costs and to improve the functionality of components so that they work together efficiently 

we believe that because of our vertical design and manufacturing strategy we are well suited to take advantage of the opportunities to leverage the close interdependence of components for disk drives our manufacturing efficiency and flexibility are critical elements of our integrated business strategy we continuously seek to improve our manufacturing efficiency and reduce manufacturing cost by 

• employing manufacturing automation • improving product quality and reliability • integrating our supply chain with suppliers and customers to enhance our demand visibility and reduce our working capital requirements • coordinating between our manufacturing group and our research and development organization to rapidly achieve volume manufacturing and • operating our facilities at optimal capabilities a vertically integrated model however tends to have less flexibility when demand moderates as it exposes us to higher unit costs as capacity utilization is not optimized 

components and raw materials 

disk drives incorporate certain components including a head disk assembly and a printed circuit board mounted to the head disk assembly which are sealed inside a rigid base and top cover containing the recording components in a contamination controlled environment we maintain a highly integrated approach to our business by designing and manufacturing a significant portion of the components we view as critical to our products such as recording heads and media 

readwrite heads the function of the readwrite head is to scan across the disk as it spins magnetically recording or reading information the tolerances of recording heads are extremely demanding and require stateoftheart equipment and processes our readwrite heads are manufactured with thinfilm and photolithographic processes similar to those used to produce semiconductor integrated circuits though challenges in magnetic film properties and topographical structures are unique to the disk drive industry we perform all primary stages of design and manufacture of readwrite heads at our facilities we use a combination of internally manufactured and externally sourced readwrite heads the mix of which varies based on product mix technology and our internal capacity levels 

media information is written to the media or disk as it rotates at very high speeds past the readwrite head the media is made from nonmagnetic material usually aluminum alloy or glass and is coated with thin layers of magnetic materials we use a combination of internally manufactured and externally sourced finished media and aluminum substrates the mix of which varies based on product mix technology and our internal capacity levels we purchase all of our glass substrates from third parties 

printed circuit board assemblies the printed circuit board assemblies pcbas are comprised of standard and custom asics and ancillary electronic control chips the asics control the movement of data to and from the readwrite heads and through the internal controller and interface which communicates with the host computer the asics and control chips form electronic circuitry that delivers instructions to a head positioning mechanism called an actuator to guide the heads to the selected track of a disk where the data is recorded or retrieved disk drive manufacturers use one or more industry standard interfaces such as serial advanced technology architecture sata small computer system interface 

scsi serial attached scsi sas or fibre channel fc to communicate to the host systems we outsource to third parties the manufacture and assembly of the pcbas used in our disk drives we do not manufacture any asics but we participate in their proprietary design 

head disk assembly the head disk assembly consists of one or more disks attached to a spindle assembly powered by a spindle motor that rotates the disks at a high constant speed around a hub readwrite heads mounted on an arm assembly similar in concept to that of a record player fly extremely close to each disk surface and record data on and retrieve it from concentric tracks in the magnetic layers of the rotating disks the readwrite heads are mounted vertically on an eshaped assembly eblock that is actuated by a voicecoil motor to allow the heads to move from track to track the eblock and the recording media are mounted inside the head disk assembly we purchase spindle motors from outside vendors and from time to time participate in the design of the motors that go into our products we use a combination of internally manufactured and externally sourced head disk assemblies 

disk drive assembly following the completion of the head disk assembly it is mated to the pcba and the completed unit goes through extensive defect mapping and testing prior to packaging and shipment disk drive assembly and test operations occur primarily at facilities located in china and thailand we perform subassembly and component manufacturing operations at our facilities in china malaysia northern ireland singapore thailand and in the united states in addition third parties manufacture and assemble components and disk drive assemblies for us in various countries worldwide 

suppliers of components and industry constraints there are a limited number of independent suppliers of components such as recording heads and media available to disk drive manufacturers vertically integrated disk drive manufacturers who manufacture their own components are less dependent on external component suppliers than less vertically integrated disk drive manufacturers 

commodity and other manufacturing costs the production of disk drives requires rare earth elements precious metals scarce alloys and industrial commodities which are subject to fluctuations in prices and the supply of which has at times been constrained in addition to increased costs of components and commodities volatility in fuel costs may also increase our costs related to commodities manufacturing and freight as a result we may increase our use of ocean shipments to help offset any increase in freight costs

in fiscal years 2016 2015 and 2014 dell inc accounted for approximately 12 14 and 13 of consolidated revenue respectively in fiscal year 2015 and 2014 hewlettpackard company accounted for approximately 12 and 13 of consolidated revenue respectively in fiscal year 2016 hp inc formerly known as hewlettpackard company completed its separation with hewlett packard enterprise company and each company accounted for less than 10 of our consolidated revenue see item 1a risk factorsrisks related to our businesswe may be adversely affected by the loss of or reduced delayed or canceled purchases by one or more of our larger customers 

competition 

we compete primarily with manufacturers of hard drives used in the enterprise client compute and client noncompute applications we are also a supplier of enterprise ssds pcie accelerator cards cloud storage solutions hdd test equipment and storage subsystems through our acquisitions the markets that we participate in are highly competitive disk drive manufacturers compete for a limited number of major disk drive customers but also compete with other companies in the electronic data storage industry that provide ssds and pcie technology some of the principal factors used by customers to differentiate among electronic data storage solutions manufacturers are storage capacity product performance product quality and reliability price per unit and price per gigabyte timetomarket and timetovolume leadership storageretrieval access times data transfer rates form factor product warranty and support capabilities supply continuity and flexibility power consumption total cost of ownership and brand while different 

markets and customers place varying levels of emphasis on these factors we believe that our products are competitive with respect to many of these factors in the markets that we currently address 

principal disk drive competitors there are three companies in the electronic data storage industry that manufacture disk drives 

• seagate selling the seagate lacie maxtor and samsung brands • western digital corporation operating the western digital and hitachi global storage technologies subsidiaries and • toshiba corporation other competition we are seeing direct competition from ssds that is adversely impacting demand for hdd in some markets including notebook and enterprise mission critical we expect that this trend will continue although we believe both product types will be required in the market to satisfy the growing demand for electronic data storage 

price erosion historically our industry has been characterized by price declines for disk drive products with comparable capacity performance and feature sets likeforlike products price declines for likeforlike products price erosion have been more pronounced during periods of 

• economic contraction in which competitors may use discounted pricing to attempt to maintain or gain market share • few new product introductions when competitors have comparable or alternative product offerings and • industry supply exceeding demand disk drive manufacturers typically attempt to offset price erosion with an improved mix of disk drive products characterized by higher capacity better performance and additional feature sets and product cost reductions 

we believe the hdd industry experienced benign price erosion in fiscal year 2014 whereas price erosion increased in fiscal years 2015 and 2016 

product life cycles and changing technology success in our industry has been dependent to a large extent on the ability to balance the introduction and transition of new products with timetovolume performance capacity and quality metrics at a competitive price level of service and support that our customers expect generally the drive manufacturer that introduces a new product first benefits from improved product mix favorable profit margins and less pricing pressure until comparable products are introduced changing technology also necessitates ongoing investments in research and development which may be difficult to recover due to rapid product life cycles and economic declines further there is a continued need to successfully execute product transitions and new product introductions as factors such as quality reliability and manufacturing yields continue to be of significant competitive importance 

seasonality 

the disk drive industry traditionally experiences seasonal variability in demand with higher levels of demand in the second half of the calendar year this seasonality is driven by consumer spending in the backtoschool season from late summer to fall and the traditional holiday shopping season from fall to winter we believe fiscal year 2015 reflected seasonality consistent with historical patterns whereas in fiscal year 2014 our industry experienced more muted seasonal patterns as supply and demand were relatively in balance in fiscal year 2016 beyond traditional seasonality variability of sales was a reflection of more cyclical demand from csps based on the timing of large systems installations and the shift of the underlying technology 

research and development 

we are committed to developing new component technologies products and alternative storage technologies our research and development focus is designed to bring new products to market in high volume with quality attributes that our customers expect before our competitors part of our product development strategy is to leverage a design platform andor subsystem within product families to serve different market needs this platform strategy allows for more efficient resource utilization leverages best design practices reduces exposure to changes in demand and allows for achievement of lower costs through purchasing economies our advanced technology integration effort focuses disk drive and component research on recording subsystems including readwrite heads and recording media marketspecific product technology and technology focused towards new business opportunities the primary purpose of our advanced technology integration effort is to ensure timely availability of mature component technologies to our product development teams as well as allowing us to leverage and coordinate those technologies in the design centers across our products in order to take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace during fiscal years 2016 2015 and 2014 we had product development expenses of approximately 1237 million 1353 million and 1226 million respectively which represented 11 10 and 9 of our consolidated revenue respectively 

patents and licenses 

as of july 1 2016 we had approximately 5000 us patents and 1300 patents issued in various foreign jurisdictions as well as approximately 1500 us and 1200 foreign patent applications pending the number of patents and patent applications will vary at any given time as part of our ongoing patent portfolio management activity due to the rapid technological change that characterizes the electronic data storage industry we believe that in addition to patent protection the improvement of existing products reliance upon trade secrets protection of unpatented proprietary knowhow and development of new products are also important to our business in establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage accordingly we intend to continue our efforts to broadly protect our intellectual property including obtaining patents where available in connection with our research and development program 

we have patent licenses with a number of companies additionally as part of our normal intellectual property practices we may be engaged in negotiations with other major electronic data storage companies and component manufacturers with respect to patent licenses 

the electronic data storage industry is characterized by significant litigation relating to patent and other intellectual property rights because of rapid technological development in the electronic data storage industry some of our products have been and in the future could be alleged to infringe existing patents of third parties from time to time we receive claims that our products infringe patents of third parties although we have been able to resolve some of those claims or potential claims by obtaining licenses or rights under the patents in question without a material adverse affect on us other claims have resulted in adverse decisions or settlements in addition other claims are pending which if resolved unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations for more information on these claims see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data—note 14 legal environmental and other contingencies the costs of engaging in intellectual property litigation in the past have been and in the future may be substantial irrespective of the merits of the claim or the outcome 

backlog 

in view of industry practice whereby customers may cancel or defer orders with little or no penalty we believe backlog in the disk drive industry is of limited indicative value in estimating future performance and results 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to us and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites some of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution and these permits are subject to modification renewal and revocation by issuing authorities 

we have established environmental management systems and continually update environmental policies and standard operating procedures for our operations worldwide we believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws regulations and permits we budget for operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental laws if additional or more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future we could incur additional operating costs and capital expenditures 

some environmental laws such as the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended the superfund law and its state equivalents can impose liability for the cost of cleanup of contaminated sites upon any of the current or former site owners or operators or upon parties who sent waste to these sites regardless of whether the owner or operator owned the site at the time of the release of hazardous substances or the lawfulness of the original disposal activity we have been identified as a potentially responsible party at several sites at each of these sites we have an assigned portion of the financial liability based on the type and amount of hazardous substances disposed of by each party at the site and the number of financially viable parties we have fulfilled our responsibilities at some of these sites and remain involved in only a few at this time 

while our ultimate costs in connection with these sites is difficult to predict with complete accuracy based on current estimates of cleanup costs and our expected allocation of these costs we do not expect costs in connection with these sites to be material 

we may be subject to various state federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment including those restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products for example the european union eu enacted the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment which prohibits the use of certain substances including lead in certain products including disk drives put on the market after july 1 2006 similar legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions including in the united states canada mexico taiwan china japan and others the european union reach directive registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals ec 19072006 also restricts substances of very high concern svhcs in products 

employees 

at july 1 2016 we employed approximately 45500 employees and temporary employees worldwide of which approximately 36100 were located in our asian operations we believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees at all levels we believe that our employee relations are good

 item 1a risk factors 

if we fail to predict demand accurately for our products in any quarter we may not be able to recapture the cost of our investments 

our industry operates primarily on quarterly purchasing cycles with much of the order flow in any given quarter typically coming at the end of that quarter our manufacturing process requires us to make significant productspecific investments in inventory in each quarter for that quarters production since we typically receive the bulk of our orders late in a quarter after we have made our investments there is a risk that our orders will not be sufficient to allow us to recapture the costs of our investment before the products resulting from that investment have become obsolete we cannot assure you that we will be able to accurately predict demand in the future 

our revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent upon customer orders in that quarter we attempt to project future orders based in part on estimates from our major customers our customers estimated requirements are not always accurate and we therefore cannot predict our quarterly revenues with any degree of certainty in addition we derive a portion of our revenues in each quarter from a number of relatively large orders if one or more of our major customers decide to defer a purchase order or delays product acceptance in any given quarter this is likely to result in reduced total revenues for that quarter 

the difficulty in forecasting demand also increases the difficulty in anticipating our inventory requirements which may cause us to overproduce finished goods resulting in inventory writeoffs or underproduce finished goods adversely affecting our ability to meet customer requirements and our market share additionally the risk of inventory writeoffs could increase if we were to continue to hold higher inventory levels we cannot be certain that we will be able to recover the costs associated with increased inventory 

other factors that may negatively impact our ability to recapture the cost of investments in any given quarter include 

• the impact of variable demand and an aggressive pricing environment for disk drives • the impact of competitive product announcements and possible excess industry supply both with respect to particular disk drive products and with respect to competing alternative storage technology solutions such as ssds in tablet notebook and enterprise compute applications • our inability to reduce our fixed costs to match sales in any quarter because of our vertical manufacturing strategy which means that we make more capital investments than we would if we were not vertically integrated • dependence on our ability to successfully qualify manufacture and sell in increasing volumes on a costeffective basis and with acceptable quality our disk drive products particularly the new disk drive products with lower cost structures • uncertainty in the amount of purchases from our distributor customers who from time to time constitute a large portion of our total sales • our product mix and the related margins of the various products • accelerated reduction in the price of our disk drives due to technological advances andor an oversupply of disk drives in the market and shifting trends in demand which can create supply and demand imbalances • manufacturing delays or interruptions particularly at our manufacturing facilities in china malaysia northern ireland singapore thailand the united kingdom or the united states • limited access to components that we obtain from a single or a limited number of suppliers 18 

• the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the cost of producing our products and the effective price of our products to foreign consumers and • operational issues arising out of the increasingly automated nature of our manufacturing processes in addition the demand for client noncompute products can be even more volatile and unpredictable than the demand for client compute products in some cases our products manufactured for client noncompute applications are uniquely configured for a single customers application which creates a risk of unwanted and unsellable inventory if the anticipated volumes are not realized this potential for unpredictable volatility is increased by the possibility of competing alternative storage technologies like flash memory meeting the customers cost and capacity metrics resulting in a rapid shift in demand from our products and disk drive technology generally to alternative storage technologies unpredictable fluctuations in demand for our products or rapid shifts in demand from our products to alternative storage technologies in new client noncompute applications could materially adversely impact our future results of operations 

market acceptance of new product introductions cannot be accurately predicted and our results of operations will suffer if there is less demand for our new products than is anticipated 

the markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product introductions and technology enhancements uncertain product life cycles and changes in customer demand the success of our new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors including market acceptance our ability to manage the risks associated with product transitions the effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand and the risk that our new products will have quality problems or other defects in the early stages of introduction that were not anticipated in the design of those products accordingly we cannot accurately determine the ultimate effect that our new products will have on our results of operations 

historically our results of operations have substantially depended upon our ability to be among the firsttomaturity with new product offerings our market share and results of operations in the future may be adversely affected if we fail to 

• consistently maintain our timetomaturity performance with our new products • produce these products in sufficient volume • qualify these products with key customers on a timely basis by meeting our customers performance and quality specifications or • achieve acceptable manufacturing yields quality and costs with these products in addition the success of our new product introductions is dependent upon our ability to qualify as a primary source of supply with our oem customers in order for our products to be considered by our customers for qualification we must be among the leaders in timetomarket with those new products once a product is accepted any failure or delay in the qualification process or a requirement that we requalify can result in our losing sales to that customer until new products are introduced the limited number of highvolume oems magnifies the effect of missing a product qualification opportunity these risks are further magnified because we expect competitive pressures to result in declining sales eroding prices and declining gross margins on our current generation products if the delivery of our products is delayed our oem customers may use our competitors products to meet their production requirements we cannot assure that we will be among the leaders in timetomarket with new products or that we will be able to successfully qualify new products with our customers in the future 

we face the related risk that consumers and businesses may wait to make their purchases if they want to buy a new product that has been shipped or announced but not yet released if this were to occur we may be unable to sell our existing inventory of products that may be less efficient and cost effective 

compared to new products as a result even if we are among the firsttomaturity with a given product subsequent introductions or announcements by our competitors of new products could cause us to lose revenue and not achieve a positive return on our investment in existing products and inventory 

if we cannot successfully deliver competitive products our future results of operations may be adversely affected 

our industries are highly competitive and our failure to anticipate and respond to technological and market developments could harm our ability to compete 

we operate in markets that are highly competitive and subject to rapid change and that are significantly affected by new product introductions substantial price erosion and lower prices as part of a strategy to gain or retain market share and customers should these practices continue we may need to continually reduce our prices for existing products to retain our market share which could adversely affect our results of operations 

our ability to offset the effect of price erosion through new product introductions at higher average prices is diminished to the extent competitors introduce products into particular markets ahead of our similar competing products our ability to offset the effect of price erosion is also diminished during times when supply exceeds demand for a particular product 

market share for our products can be negatively affected by our customers diversifying their sources of supply as our competitors enter the market for particular products as well as by our ability to ramp volume production of new product offerings when our competitors successfully introduce product offerings that are competitive with our recently introduced products our customers may quickly diversify their sources of supply any significant decline in our market share in any of our principal market applications would adversely affect our results of operations 

our principal sources of competition include 

• disk drive manufacturers such as western digital corporation and toshiba • companies providing storage subsystems and components to oems • electronic manufacturing services ems companies acquiring the necessary skills and intellectual property to enter the enterprise data storage marketplace • other high performance computing hpc data storage providers and • collaborations between inhouse development teams of existing and potential customers and a combination of ems contract electronic manufacturing cem or emerging technology companies we also experience competition from other companies that produce alternative storage technologies like flash memory where increasing capacity decreasing cost energy efficiency and improvements in performance ruggedness have resulted in competition with our lower capacity smaller form factor disk drives this competition has traditionally been in the markets for handheld consumer electronics applications and now it also includes solid state drives ssds for tablet notebook and enterprise compute applications certain customers for both notebook and enterprise compute applications are adopting ssds as alternatives to hard drives in certain applications further adoption of these alternative storage technologies may impact the competitiveness of our product portfolio and reduce our market share and adversely affect our results of operation 

the markets for our data storage system products are also characterized by technological change driven in part by the adoption of new industry standards these standards provide mechanisms to ensure technology component interoperability can occur and may reduce our capability for differentiation or innovation and our affected products would revert to commodity status this could lower the barriers to 

entry to our market away from our specialist research and development skills and enable entry for the generalpurpose design skills found in some large ems and cem companies commodity markets are driven by extremely low margins and very aggressive competitive pricing if our market becomes more commoditized and we fail to deliver innovative valueadded alternatives to our customers we will have difficulty competing against the larger ems and cem companies if we are unable to compete successfully against our current and future competitors we could experience profit margin reductions or loss of market share which could significantly harm our financial condition 

if we do not develop products in time to keep pace with technological changes our results of operations will be adversely affected 

our customers have demanded new generations of disk drive products as advances in computer hardware and software have created the need for improved storage products with features such as increased storage capacity improved performance and reliability and lower cost we and our competitors have developed improved products and we will need to continue to do so in the future such product development requires significant investments in research and development we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully complete the design or introduction of new products in a timely manner that we will be able to manufacture new products in sufficient volumes with acceptable manufacturing yields that we will be able to successfully market these new products or that these products will perform to specifications on a longterm basis in addition the impact of slowing areal density growth may adversely impact our ability to be successful 

when we develop new products with higher capacity and more advanced technology our results of operations may decline because the increased difficulty and complexity associated with producing these products increases the likelihood of reliability quality or operability problems if our products suffer increases in failures are of low quality or are not reliable customers may reduce their purchases of our products and our manufacturing rework and scrap costs and service and warranty costs may increase in addition a decline in the reliability of our products may make us less competitive as compared with other disk drive manufacturers or competing technologies 

changes in demand for computer systems and storage subsystems may in the future cause a decline in demand for our products 

our products are components in computers data storage systems and consumer electronics devices the demand for these products has been volatile unexpected slowdowns in demand for computer systems storage subsystems or consumer electronics devices generally cause sharp declines in demand for our products declines in consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services and on our financial condition and results of operations 

while sales to client noncompute and cloud systems and solutions markets are becoming a more significant source of revenue sales to the client compute market remain an important part of our business the client compute market however has been and we expect it to continue to be adversely affected by the growth of tablet computers smart phones and similar devices and that perform many of the same capabilities as computers the lengthening of product life cycles and macroeconomic conditions we believe that the deterioration of the client compute market has accelerated recently and that this accelerated deterioration may continue or further accelerate which could cause our operating results to suffer additionally if demand in the client compute market is worse than expected as a result of these or other conditions demand for our products in the client compute market may decrease at a faster rate and our operating results may be adversely affected 

the enterprise storage market has been adversely affected by the growth of the utilization of nand flash in mission critical applications this deterioration of the enterprise storage market could cause our operating results to suffer 

causes of declines in demand for our products in the past have included weakness in macroeconomic environments announcements or introductions of major new operating systems or semiconductor improvements or changes in consumer preferences such as the shift to mobile devices we believe these announcements and introductions have from time to time caused consumers to defer their purchases and made inventory obsolete whenever an oversupply of our products causes participants in our industry to have higher than anticipated inventory levels we experience even more intense price competition from other manufacturers than usual 

increases in the areal density of disk drives may outpace customers demand for storage capacity 

the rate of increase in areal density or storage capacity per square inch on a disk may be greater than the increase in our customers demand for aggregate storage capacity particularly in certain market applications like client compute as a result our customers storage capacity needs may be satisfied with lower priced low capacity disk drives these factors could decrease our sales especially when combined with continued price erosion which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we may not be successful in our efforts to grow our cloud systems and solutions business 

we have made and are continuing to make investments to expand and develop our cloud systems and solutions business our cloud systems and solutions business is subject to the following risks 

• the cloud systems and solutions market may develop more slowly than we expect • we may not be able to offer compelling solutions to enterprises and consumers and • our cloud systems and solutions business generally has a long and unpredictable sales cycle and growth in this business is likely to depend on relatively large customer orders which may increase the variability of our results of operations and the difficulty of matching revenues with expenses our results of operations and share price may be adversely affected if we are not successful in our efforts to grow our cloud computing business as anticipated in addition our growth in this sector may bring us into closer competition with some of our customers or potential customers which may decrease their willingness to do business with us 

changes in the macroeconomic environment have negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact our results of operations 

due to the continuing uncertainty about current macroeconomic conditions affecting consumer and enterprise spending we believe our customers may postpone spending in response to tighter credit unemployment negative financial news andor declines in income or asset values which could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products continuing high unemployment rates low levels of consumer liquidity risk of default on sovereign debt and volatility in credit and equity markets have weakened consumer confidence and decreased consumer and enterprise spending in many regions around the world other factors that could influence demand include conditions in the residential real estate and mortgage markets labor and healthcare costs access to credit consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior these and other economic factors could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and on our financial condition and operating results 

our quarterly results of operations fluctuate sometimes significantly from period to period and may cause our share price to decline 

in the past our quarterly revenue and results of operations have fluctuated sometimes significantly from period to period these fluctuations which we expect to continue may be occasioned by a variety of factors including 

• current uncertainty in global economic conditions may pose a risk to the overall economy • adverse changes in the level of economic activity in the major regions in which we do business • competitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices by our competitors targeted to encourage shifting of customer demand • delays or problems in our introduction of new products particularly new disk drives with lower cost structures the inability to achieve high production yields or delays in customer qualification or initial product quality issues • changes in purchasing patterns by our distributor customers • application of new or revised industry standards • disruptions in our supply chain • increased costs or adverse changes in availability of supplies of raw materials or components • the impact of corporate restructuring activities that we have and may continue to engage in • changes in the demand for the computer systems and data storage products that contain our products due to seasonality economic conditions and other factors • changes in purchases from period to period by our primary customers • shifting trends in customer demand which when combined with overproduction of particular products particularly when the industry is served by multiple suppliers results in unfavorable supplydemand imbalances • our high proportion of fixed costs including research and development expenses • any impairments in goodwill or other longlived assets • announcements of new products services or technological innovations by us or our competitors and • adverse changes in the performance of our products as a result we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our revenue and results of operations may not be meaningful and that these comparisons may not be an accurate indicator of our future performance our results of operations in one or more future quarters may fail to meet the expectations of investment research analysts or investors which could cause an immediate and significant decline in the trading price of our ordinary shares 

because we experience seasonality in the sales of our products our results of operations will generally be adversely impacted during the second half of our fiscal year 

sales of computer systems storage subsystems and consumer electronics tend to be seasonal and therefore we expect to continue to experience seasonality in our business as we respond to variations in our customers demand for our products in particular we anticipate that sales of our products will continue to be lower during the second half of our fiscal year in the client compute and client noncompute market applications of our disk drive business this seasonality is partially attributable to the historical trend in our 

results derived from our customers increased sales of desktop computers notebook computers and consumer electronics during the backtoschool and winter holiday season in the enterprise market our sales are seasonal because of the capital budgeting and purchasing cycles of our end users since our working capital needs peak during periods in which we are increasing production in anticipation of orders that have not yet been received our results of operations will fluctuate seasonally even if the forecasted demand for our products proves accurate furthermore it is difficult for us to evaluate the degree to which this seasonality may affect our business in future periods because of the rate and unpredictability of product transitions and new product introductions particularly in the client noncompute market as well as macroeconomic conditions 

we have a long and unpredictable sales cycle for enterprise data storage solutions 

our enterprise data storage solutions are technically complex and we typically supply them in high quantities to a small number of customers many of our products are also tailored to meet the specific requirements of individual customers and are often integrated by our customers into the systems and products that they sell factors that affect the length of our sales cycle include 

• the time required for testing and evaluating our products before they are deployed • the size of the deployment and • the degree of system configuration necessary to deploy our products as a result our sales cycle for enterprise data storage solutions is often in excess of one year and the length of our sales cycle is frequently unpredictable in addition the emerging and evolving nature of the market for the products that we sell may lead prospective customers to postpone their purchasing decisions we invest resources and incur costs during this cycle that may not be recovered if we do not successfully conclude sales these factors lead to difficulty in matching revenues with expenses and to increased expenditures which together may adversely impact our results of operations 

we may be adversely affected by the loss of or reduced delayed or canceled purchases by one or more of our larger customers 

some of our key customers account for a large portion of our disk drive revenue while we have longstanding relationships with many of our customers if any of our key customers were to significantly reduce their purchases from us our results of operations would be adversely affected while sales to major customers may vary from period to period a major customer that permanently discontinues or significantly reduces its relationship with us could be difficult to replace in line with industry practice new customers usually require that we pass a lengthy and rigorous qualification process at the customers cost accordingly it may be difficult or costly for us to attract new major customers additionally mergers acquisitions consolidations or other significant transactions involving our customers generally entail risks to our business if a significant transaction involving any of our key customers results in the loss of or reduction in purchases by these key customers it could have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and prospects 

we are dependent on sales to distributors and retailers which may increase price erosion and the volatility of our sales 

a substantial portion of our sales has been to distributors of disk drive products certain of our distributors may also market other products that compete with our products product qualification programs in this distribution channel are limited which increases the number of competing products that are available to satisfy demand particularly in times of lengthening product cycles as a result purchasing decisions in this channel are based largely on price terms and product availability sales volumes through this channel are also less predictable and subject to greater volatility than sales to our oem customers in 

addition deterioration in business and economic conditions could exacerbate price erosion and volatility as distributors lower prices to compensate for lower demand and higher inventory levels our distributors ability to access credit for purposes of funding their operations may also affect purchases of our products by these customers 

if distributors reduce their purchases of our products or prices decline significantly in the distribution channel or if distributors experience financial difficulties or terminate their relationships with us our revenues and results of operations would be adversely affected 

we believe that industry demand for storage products in the longterm is increasing due to the proliferation of mediarich digital content in consumer applications and is fueling increased consumer demand for storage this has led to the expansion of our branded solutions such as external storage products to provide additional storage capacity and to secure data in case of disaster or system failure or to provide independent storage solutions for multiple users in home or small business environments consumer spending on retail sales of our branded solutions has deteriorated in some markets and may continue to do so if poor global economic conditions continue and higher levels of unemployment persist this could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services and on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition such retail sales of our branded solutions traditionally experience seasonal variability in demand with higher levels of demand in the first half of our fiscal year driven by consumer spending in the backtoschool season from late summer to fall and the traditional holiday shopping season from fall to winter additionally our ability to reach such consumers depends on us maintaining effective working relationships with major retailers and distributors failure to anticipate consumer demand for our branded solutions as well as an inability to maintain effective working relationships with retail and online distributors may adversely impact our future results of operations 

our international sales and manufacturing operations subject us to risks related to disruptions in foreign markets currency exchange fluctuations longer payment cycles seasonality limitations imposed by a variety of legal and regulatory regimes potential adverse tax consequences increased costs our customers credit and access to capital healthrelated risks and access to personnel 

we have significant sales and manufacturing operations in foreign countries including manufacturing facilities sales personnel and customer support operations we have manufacturing facilities in china malaysia northern ireland singapore and thailand in addition to those in the united states a substantial portion of our client compute disk drive assembly occurs in our facility in china 

our international operations are subject to economic risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries including the following 

• disruptions in foreign markets disruptions in financial markets and the deterioration of the underlying economic conditions in the past in some countries including those in asia united kingdom and the european union have had an impact on our sales to customers located in or whose enduser customers are located in these countries • fluctuations in currency exchange rates prices for our products are denominated predominately in us dollars even when sold to customers that are located outside the united states an increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside of the us where we sell in dollars this could adversely impact our sales and market share in such areas or increase pressure on us to lower our price and adversely impact our profit margins a weakened dollar could increase the cost of expenses such as payroll utilities tax and marketing expenses as well as overseas capital expenditures any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations we may attempt to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes by among other things entering into foreign currency 25 

forward exchange contracts however these contracts may not cover our full exposure and subject us to certain counterparty credit risks see item 7aquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskforeign currency exchange risk of this report for additional information about our foreign currency exchange risk 

• longer payment cycles our customers outside of the united states are often allowed longer time periods for payment than our us customers this increases the risk of nonpayment due to the possibility that the financial condition of particular customers may worsen during the course of the payment period • seasonality seasonal reductions in the business activities of our customers during the summer months particularly in europe typically result in lower earnings during those periods • legal and regulatory limitations our international operations are affected by limitations on imports tariffs duties currency exchange control regulations price controls export control laws including the trade and economic sanctions administered by the office of foreign assets control and other restraints on trade in addition the governments of many countries including china malaysia northern ireland singapore and thailand in which we have significant operating assets have exercised and continue to exercise significant influence over many aspects of their domestic economies and international trade although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate these or other applicable laws and regulations to which we may be subject violations of these laws and regulations could lead to significant penalties including restraints on our export or import privileges monetary fines criminal proceedings and regulatory or other actions that could materially adversely affect our results of operations • potential adverse tax consequences our international operations create a risk of potential adverse tax consequences including imposition of withholding or other taxes on payments by our subsidiaries in addition our taxable income in any jurisdiction is dependent upon acceptance of our operational practices and intercompany transfer pricing by local tax authorities as being on an arms length basis due to inconsistencies in application of the arms length standard among taxing authorities as well as a lack of adequate treatybased protection transfer pricing challenges by tax authorities could if successful substantially increase our income tax expense we are subject to tax audits around the world and are under audit in various jurisdictions and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax against us although we believe our tax positions are reasonable the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from our recorded income tax provisions and accruals the ultimate results of an audit could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made and could result in increases to our overall tax expense in subsequent periods in light of the ongoing fiscal challenges many countries are facing various levels of government are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative action to increase tax revenue in addition the organization for economic cooperation and developments base erosion and profit shifting recommendations are reshaping international tax rules in numerous countries these actual and potential changes in the relevant tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals along with potential changes in accounting and other laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations could increase the risk of double taxation cause increased tax audit activity and could impact our effective tax rate • increased costs the shipping and transportation costs associated with our international operations are typically higher than those associated with our us operations resulting in decreased operating margins in some foreign countries • credit and access to capital risks our international customers could have reduced access to working capital due to higher interest rates reduced bank lending resulting from contractions in the 26 

money supply or the deterioration in the customers or its banks financial condition or the inability to access other financing 

• global health outbreaks the occurrence of a pandemic disease may adversely impact our operations and some of our key customers such diseases could also potentially disrupt the timeliness and reliability of the distribution network we rely on access to personnel there is substantial competition for qualified and capable personnel in certain jurisdictions in which we operate including china which may make it difficult for us to recruit and retain qualified employees in sufficient numbers increased difficulty in recruiting or retaining sufficient and adequate personnel in our international operations may lead to increased manufacturing and employment compensation costs which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we could suffer a loss of revenue and increased costs exposure to significant liability reputational harm and other serious negative consequences if we sustain cyberattacks or other data security breaches that disrupt our operations or result in the dissemination of proprietary or confidential information about us or our customers or other thirdparties 

our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer equipment and the electronic data stored in our databases from damage by among other things earthquake fire natural disasters accidents power disruptions telecommunications failures acts of terrorism or war employee misconduct physical or electronic breakins cyberattacks or similar events or disruptions we manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our operations in addition our outsourcing services and cloud computing businesses routinely process store and transmit large amounts of data for our customers and vendors including sensitive and personally identifiable information as our operations become more automated and increasingly interdependent our exposure to the risks posed by these types of events will increase we have been and will likely continue to be subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes cyberattacks or other computerrelated attempts to breach the information technology it systems we use for these purposes we may also be subject to it system failures and network disruptions due to these factors experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of thirdparties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products in addition sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from thirdparties may contain defects in design or manufacture including bugs and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system 

the costs to us to eliminate or address the foregoing security problems and security vulnerabilities before or after a cyberincident could be significant system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions we could lose existing or potential customers for outsourcing services or other it solutions in connection with any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products in addition breaches of our security measures and the unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers or other thirdparties could expose us our vendors and customers or other thirdparties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business in addition we rely in certain limited capacities on thirdparty data management providers whose possible security problems and security vulnerabilities may have similar effects on us 

we are subject to laws rules and regulations in the us and other countries relating to the collection use and security of user data in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries and among us our subsidiaries and other parties with which we have commercial relations our ability to execute transactions and to possess and use personal information and data in conducting our business subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens that may require us to notify vendors customers or employees of a data security breach we have incurred and will continue to incur significant expenses to comply with mandatory privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law regulation industry standards or contractual obligations these laws protocols and standards continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices if we fail to comply with applicable federal state or international privacyrelated or data protection laws we may be subject to proceedings by governmental entities and incur penalties or significant legal liability 

if we do not control our fixed costs we will not be able to compete effectively in our industry 

we continually seek to make our cost structure and business processes more efficient we are focused on increasing workforce flexibility and scalability and improving overall competitiveness by leveraging our global capabilities as well as external talent and skills worldwide our strategy involves to a substantial degree increasing revenue and product volume while at the same time controlling operating expenses if we do not control our operating expenses our ability to compete in the marketplace may be impaired in the past activities to reduce operating costs have included closures and transfers of facilities significant personnel reductions and efforts to increase automation 

if we experience shortages or delays in the receipt of or cost increases in critical components equipment or raw materials necessary to manufacture our products we may suffer lower operating margins production delays and other material adverse effects 

the cost quality and supply of components subassemblies certain equipment and raw materials used to manufacture our products and key components like recording media and heads are critical to our success the equipment we use to manufacture our products and components is frequently custom made and comes from a few suppliers and the lead times required to obtain manufacturing equipment can be significant particularly important for our products include readwrite heads aluminum or glass substrates for recording media asics spindle motors printed circuit boards and suspension assemblies 

we rely on sole suppliers or a limited number of suppliers for some of these components that we do not manufacture including aluminum and glass substrates readwrite heads asics spindle motors printed circuit boards and suspension assemblies many of such component suppliers are geographically concentrated in particular in thailand which makes our supply chain more vulnerable to regional disruptions such as the severe flooding in thailand in october 2011 which had a material impact on the production and availability of many components if our vendors for these components are unable to meet our cost quality and supply requirements we could experience a shortage in supply or an increase in production costs which would adversely affect our results of operations 

certain rare earth elements are critical in the manufacture of our products we purchase components that contain rare earth elements from a number of countries including the peoples republic of china we cannot predict whether any nation will impose regulations quotas or embargoes upon the rare earth elements incorporated into our products that would restrict the worldwide supply of such metals or increase their cost we have experienced increased costs and production delays when we were unable to obtain the necessary equipment or sufficient quantities of some components andor have been forced to pay higher prices or make volume purchase commitments or advance deposits for some components equipment or raw materials that were in short supply in the industry in general if any major supplier were to restrict the supply available to us or increase the cost of the rare earth elements used in our products we 

could experience a shortage in supply or an increase in production costs which would adversely affect our results of operations 

consolidation among component manufacturers has resulted and may continue to result in some component manufacturers exiting the industry or not making sufficient investments in research to develop new components 

if there is a shortage of or delay in supplying us with critical components equipment or raw materials then 

• it is likely that our suppliers would raise their prices and if we could not pass these price increases to our customers our operating margin would decline • we might have to reengineer some products which would likely cause production and shipment delays make the reengineered products more costly and provide us with a lower rate of return on these products • we would likely have to allocate the components we receive to certain of our products and ship less of others which could reduce our revenues and could cause us to lose sales to customers who could purchase more of their required products from manufacturers that either did not experience these shortages or delays or that made different allocations and • we might be late in shipping products causing potential customers to make purchases from our competitors thus causing our revenue and operating margin to decline we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain critical components in a timely and economic manner 

we often aim to lead the market in new technology deployments and leverage unique and customized technology from single source suppliers who are early adopters in the emerging market our options in supplier selection in these cases are limited and the supplier based technology may consequently be single sourced until wider adoption of the technology occurs and any necessary licenses become available in such cases any technical issues in the suppliers technology may cause us to delay shipments of our new technology deployments and therefore harm our financial position 

if revenues fall or customer demand decreases significantly we may not meet all of our purchase commitments to certain suppliers 

from time to time we enter into longterm noncancelable purchase commitments or make large upfront investments with certain suppliers in order to secure certain components or technologies for the production of our products or to supplement our internal manufacturing capacity for certain components if our actual revenues in the future are lower than our projections or if customer demand decreases significantly below our projections we may not meet all of our purchase commitments with these suppliers as a result it is possible that our revenues will not be sufficient to recoup our upfront investments in which case we will have to shift output from our internal manufacturing facilities to these suppliers or make penaltytype payments under these contracts 

conflict minerals regulations may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products 

in august 2012 the sec adopted rules establishing additional disclosure and reporting requirements regarding the use of specified minerals or conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured these rules will require us to determine disclose and report whether or not such conflict minerals originate from the democratic republic of the congo or an adjoining country the most recent report was filed on may 27 2016 these rules could affect our ability to source certain materials used in our products at competitive prices and 

could impact the availability of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products including gold tantalum tin and tungsten as there may be only a limited number of suppliers of conflict free minerals we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary conflict free minerals in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices our customers including our oem customers may require that our products be free of conflict minerals and our revenues and margins may be harmed if we are unable to procure conflict free minerals at a reasonable price or at all or are unable to pass through any increased costs associated with meeting these demands additionally we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of all minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement we may also face challenges with government regulators and our customers and suppliers if we are unable to sufficiently verify that the metals used in our products are conflict free we expect that there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements such as costs related to determining the source of certain minerals used in our products as well as costs related to possible changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification and disclosure requirements 

the loss of key executive officers and employees could negatively impact our business prospects 

our future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued service of key members of management as well as marketing sales and product development personnel the loss of one or more of our key personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we believe our future success will also depend in large part upon our ability to attract retain and further motivate highly skilled management marketing sales and product development personnel we have experienced intense competition for personnel and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our key employees or that we will be successful in attracting assimilating and retaining personnel in the future 

due to the complexity of our products some defects may only become detectable after deployment 

our products are highly complex and are designed to operate in and form part of larger complex networks and storage systems defects in our products or in the networks and systems of which they form a part directly or indirectly have resulted in and may in the future result in 

• increased costs and product delays until complex solution level interoperability issues are resolved • costs associated with the remediation of any problems attributable to our products • loss of or delays in revenues • loss of customers • failure to achieve market acceptance and loss of market share • increased service and warranty costs and • increased insurance costs defects in our products could also result in legal actions by our customers for property damage injury or death product liability claims could exceed the level of insurance coverage that we have obtained to cover defects in our products any significant uninsured claims could significantly harm our financial condition 

political events war terrorism natural disasters public health issues and other circumstances could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

war terrorism geopolitical uncertainties natural disasters public health issues and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global 

economy and thus could have a strong negative effect on our business our suppliers logistics providers manufacturing vendors and customers our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes fire power shortages terrorist attacks other hostile acts labor disputes public health issues and other events beyond our control such events could decrease demand for our products make it difficult or impossible for us to make and deliver products to our customers or to receive components from our suppliers and create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain in the event of a natural disaster losses and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations and our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected should major public health issues including pandemics arise we could be negatively affected by stringent employee travel restrictions additional limitations in freight services governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in our operations and some of our key customers 

macroeconomic developments like the withdrawal of united kingdom from the european union the debt crisis in certain countries in the european union and slowing economies in parts of asia and south america could negatively affect our business operating results or financial condition which in turn could adversely affect our stock price a general weakening of and related declining corporate confidence in the global economy or the curtailment in government or corporate spending could cause current or potential customers to reduce their it budgets or be unable to fund hardware systems which could cause customers to delay decrease or cancel purchases of our products or cause customers not to pay us or to delay paying us for previously purchased products and services 

failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the sale and manufacturing of products in certain states and countries may subject us and our suppliers to state federal and international laws and regulations governing protection of the environment including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites restrictions on the presence of certain substances in electronic products and the responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling we endeavor to ensure that we and our suppliers comply with all applicable environmental laws and regulations however compliance may increase our operating costs and otherwise impact future financial results if additional or more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future we could incur additional operating costs and capital expenditures if we fail to comply with applicable environmental laws regulations initiatives or standards of conduct our customers may refuse to purchase our products and we could be subject to fines penalties and possible prohibition of sales of our products into one or more states or countries liability to our customers and damage to our reputation which could result in a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations 

any cost reduction initiatives that we undertake may not deliver the results we expect and these actions may adversely affect our business 

on june 27 2016 and july 11 2016 we announced restructuring plans to be substantially completed by the end of fiscal year 2017 in addition management will continue to evaluate our global footprint and cost structure and additional restructuring plans are expected to be formalized as a result of our restructuring we may experience a loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge disruptions to our operations andor inefficiency during transitional periods any costcutting measures could impact employee retention in addition we cannot be sure that the cost reduction and global footprint consolidation will be successful in reducing our overall expenses as we expect or that additional costs will not offset any such reductions or global footprint consolidation if our operating costs are higher than we expect or if we do not maintain adequate control of our costs and expenses our result of operations may suffer 

our ability to use our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards might be limited 

the use of a portion of our us net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards is subject to annual limitations pursuant to us tax law section 382 of the us internal revenue code generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards that might be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone significant changes in ownership as a result future changes in ownership could put further limitations on the availability of our net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards 

deterioration in global credit and financial market conditions could negatively impact the value of our current portfolio of cash equivalents or shortterm investments and our ability to meet our financing objectives 

our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase our shortterm investments consist primarily of readily marketable debt securities with remaining maturities of more than 90 days at the time of purchase our investment policy has as its principal objectives the preservation of principal and maintenance of liquidity we mitigate default risk by investing in highquality investment grade securities limiting the time to maturity and by monitoring the counterparties and underlying obligors closely 

while as of the date of this filing we are not aware of any material downgrades losses or other significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or shortterm investments no assurance can be given that future deterioration in conditions of the global credit and financial markets would not negatively impact our current portfolio of cash equivalents or shortterm investments or our ability to meet our financing objectives 

we are at times subject to intellectual property legal proceedings and claims which could cause us to incur significant additional costs or prevent us from selling our products and which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject from timetotime to legal proceedings and claims including claims of alleged infringement of the patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties by us or our customers in connection with their use of our products intellectual property litigation can be expensive and timeconsuming regardless of the merits of any claim and could divert our managements attention from operating our business in addition intellectual property lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties due to the complexity of the technical issues involved which may cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations patent litigation has increased due to the current uncertainty of the law and the increasing competition and overlap of product functionality in the field some of the actions that we face from timetotime seek injunctions against the sale of our products andor substantial monetary damages which if granted or awarded could materially harm our business financial condition and operating results 

we cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of others we may not be aware of currently filed patent applications that relate to our products or technology if patents are later issued on these applications we may be liable for infringement if our products were found to infringe the intellectual property rights of others we could be required to pay substantial damages cease the manufacture use and sale of infringing products in one or more geographic locations expend significant resources to develop noninfringing technology discontinue the use of specific processes or obtain licenses to the technology infringed we might not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms or at all or be able to reengineer our products successfully to avoid infringement any of the foregoing could cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling our products which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition see item 8 financial statements and supplementary datanote 14 legal environmental and other contingencies contained in this report for a description of pending intellectual property proceedings 

we may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect our ip rights in the past we have been involved in significant and expensive disputes regarding our ip rights and those of others including claims that we may be infringing patents trademarks and other ip rights of thirdparties we expect that we will be involved in similar disputes in the future 

there can be no assurance that 

• any of our existing patents will continue to be held valid if challenged • patents will be issued for any of our pending applications • any claims allowed from existing or pending patents will have sufficient scope or strength to protect us • our patents will be issued in the primary countries where our products are sold in order to protect our rights and potential commercial advantage • we will be able to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality agreements with our customers suppliers and employees and through other security measures and • others will not gain access to our trade secrets in addition our competitors may be able to design their products around our patents and other proprietary rights enforcement of our rights often requires litigation if we bring a patent infringement action and are not successful our competitors would be able to use similar technology to compete with us moreover the defendant in such an action may successfully countersue us for infringement of their patents or assert a counterclaim that our patents are invalid or unenforceable 

furthermore we have significant operations and sales in foreign countries where intellectual property laws and enforcement policies are often less developed less stringent or more difficult to enforce than in the united states 

we may not be able to identify suitable strategic alliances acquisitions joint ventures or investment opportunities to successfully acquire and integrate companies that provide complementary products or technologies or to realize the anticipated benefits of such transactions 

our growth strategy involves pursuing strategic alliances with making acquisitions of forming joint ventures with or making investments in other companies that are complementary to our business there is substantial competition for attractive strategic alliance acquisition joint venture and investment candidates accordingly we may not be able to identify suitable strategic alliances acquisition joint venture or investment candidates even if we can identify them we cannot assure you that we will be able to partner with acquire or invest in suitable candidates or integrate acquired technologies or operations successfully into our existing technologies and operations moreover our ability to finance potential strategic alliances acquisitions joint ventures or investments will be limited by our high degree of leverage the covenants contained in the instruments that govern our outstanding indebtedness and any agreements governing any other debt we may incur 

if we are successful in forming strategic alliances or acquiring forming joint ventures or making investments in other companies any of these transactions may have an adverse effect on our results of operations particularly while the operations of an acquired business are being integrated it is also likely that integration of acquired companies would lead to the loss of key employees from those companies or the loss of customers of those companies in addition the integration of any acquired companies would 

require substantial attention from our senior management which may limit the amount of time available to be devoted to our daytoday operations or to the execution of our strategy growth by strategic alliance acquisition joint venture or investment involves an even higher degree of risk to the extent we combine new product offerings and enter new markets in which we have limited experience and no assurance can be given that acquisitions of entities with new or alternative business models will be successfully integrated or achieve their stated objectives there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits of any strategic alliance acquisition joint venture or investment that we make or if we do how long it will take to achieve such benefits 

furthermore the expansion of our business involves the risk that we might not manage our growth effectively that we would incur additional debt to finance these acquisitions or investments that we may have impairment of goodwill or acquired intangible assets associated with these acquisitions and that we would incur substantial charges relating to the writeoff of inprocess research and development similar to that which we incurred in connection with several of our prior acquisitions each of these items could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we could issue additional ordinary shares in connection with future strategic alliances acquisitions joint ventures or investments issuing shares in connection with such transactions would have the effect of diluting your ownership percentage of the ordinary shares and could cause the price of our ordinary shares to decline 

servicing our indebtedness requires a significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt 

we are leveraged and have significant debt service obligations our significant debt and debt service requirements could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities for example our high level of debt presents the following risks 

• we are required to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements • our substantial leverage increases our vulnerability to economic downturns and adverse competitive and industry conditions and could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that are less leveraged • our debt service obligations could limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry and could limit our ability to pursue other business opportunities borrow more money for operations or capital in the future and implement our business strategies • our level of debt may restrict us from raising additional financing on satisfactory terms to fund working capital capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements and • covenants in our debt instruments limit our ability to pay future dividends or make other restricted payments and investments in the event that we need to refinance all or a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures we may not be able to obtain terms as favorable as the terms of our existing debt or refinance our existing debt at all if prevailing interest rates or other factors existing at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing then the interest expense relating to the refinanced debt would increase furthermore if any rating agency changes our credit rating or outlook our debt and equity securities could 

be negatively affected which could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt or raise additional capital 

in addition our business may not generate cash flow in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay the principal of or interest on our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs including working capital capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements 

our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control we cannot assure you that 

• our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations • we will continue to realize the cost savings revenue growth and operating improvements that result from the execution of our longterm strategic plan or • future sources of funding will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs if we cannot fund our liquidity needs we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements we cannot assure you that any of these remedies could if necessary be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all or that they would permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations in addition if we incur additional debt the risks associated with our substantial leverage including the risk that we will be unable to service our debt or generate enough cash flow to fund our liquidity needs could intensify 

the price of our ordinary shares may be volatile and could decline significantly 

the stock market in general and the market for technology stocks in particular has recently experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of companies if these market or industrybased fluctuations continue the trading price of our ordinary shares could decline significantly independent of our actual operating performance and you could lose all or a substantial part of your investment the market price of our ordinary shares could fluctuate significantly in response to several factors including among others 

• general uncertainty in stock market conditions occasioned by global economic conditions negative financial news and the continued instability of several large financial institutions • actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations • announcements of innovations new products or significant price reductions by us or our competitors including those competitors who offer alternative storage technology solutions • our failure to meet the performance estimates of investment research analysts • the timing of announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts or acquisitions • general stock market conditions • the occurrence of major catastrophic events • changes in financial estimates by investment research analysts • changes in the credit ratings of our indebtedness by rating agencies and • the sale of our ordinary shares held by certain equity investors or members of management 35 

any decision to reduce or discontinue the payment of cash dividends to our shareholders or the repurchase of our ordinary shares pursuant to our previously announced share repurchase program could cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline significantly 

although we have announced targeted regular cash dividend amounts and a share repurchase program we are under no obligation to pay cash dividends to our shareholders in the future at the announced targeted levels or at all or to repurchase our ordinary shares at any particular price or at all the declaration and payment of any future dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and our previously announced share repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time our payment of quarterly cash dividends and the repurchase of our ordinary shares pursuant to our share repurchase program are subject to among other things our financial position and results of operations available cash and cash flow capital and regulatory requirements market and economic conditions our ordinary share price and other factors any reduction or discontinuance by us of the payment of quarterly cash dividends or the repurchase of our ordinary shares pursuant to our share repurchase program could cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline significantly moreover in the event our payment of quarterly cash dividends or repurchases of our ordinary shares are reduced or discontinued our failure to resume such activities at historical levels could result in a persistent lower market valuation of our ordinary shares 

significant fluctuations in the market price of our ordinary shares could result in securities class action claims against us 

significant price and value fluctuations have occurred with respect to the publicly traded securities of technology companies the price of our ordinary shares is likely to be volatile in the future in the past following periods of decline in the market price of a companys securities class action lawsuits have often been pursued against that company if similar litigation were pursued against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources which could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity

business overview 

our industry is characterized by several trends and factors that have a material impact on our strategic planning financial condition and results of operations 

demand for electronic data storage 

the continued advancement of the cloud the proliferation of a variety of mobile devices globally development of the internet of things iot increasingly pervasive use of video surveillance evolution of consumer electronic devices and enterprise use of big data analytics are driving the growth of digital content factors contributing to this growth include 

• creation sharing and consumption of mediarich digital content such as highresolution photos high definition video and digital music through smart phones tablets digital cameras personal video cameras dvrs gaming consoles or other digital devices 44 

• creation aggregation and distribution of digital content through services and other offerings such as facebook® instagram® itunes® netflix® google® and youtube® • new surveillance systems which feature higher resolution digital cameras and thus require larger data storage capacities • creation and collection of data through the evolution of the iot ecosystem big data analytics and new technology trends such as selfdriving cars and drones • build out of large numbers of cloud data centers by cloud service providers and private companies transitioning onsite data centers into the cloud • protection of increased digital content through redundant storage on backup devices and externally provided storage services as a result of these factors the nature and volume of content being created requires greater storage which is more efficiently and economically facilitated by higher capacity storage devices in order to store manage distribute analyze and backup such content we expect this to support the growth in demand for electronic data storage solutions in developed and emerging economies well into the future 

the amount of data created as well as where and how data is stored continues to evolve with the proliferation of mobile devices the growth of cloud computing and the evolving iot in addition the economics of storage infrastructure are also evolving with the utilization of public and private hyperscale storage and opensource solutions reducing the total cost of ownership of storage while increasing the speed and efficiency with which customers can leverage massive computing and storage devices accordingly we expect these trends will continue to create significant demand for electronic data storage solutions going forward 

demand trends for disk drives 

we believe that continued growth in digital content requires increasingly higher storage capacity in order to store aggregate host distribute analyze manage backup and use such content we also believe that as architectures evolve to serve the growing commercial and consumer user base throughout the world the manner which hard drives are delivered to market and utilized by our customers will evolve as well 

we believe that in the foreseeable future the traditional enterprise and client compute markets that require high capacity storage solutions and the data intensive client noncompute markets will continue to be best served by hard disk drives due to the industrys ability to deliver the most cost effective reliable and energy efficient mass storage devices furthermore the increased use of client noncompute devices that both consume mediarich digital content streamed from the cloud and create rich digital content that is stored in the cloud increases the demand for high capacity hard disk drives in enterprise nearline applications 

we also believe that as hard disk drive capacities continue to increase unit demand does not reflect the increase in exabytes demand in recent years this trend has resulted in demand for fewer units but with higher average capacity per drive 

industry supply balance 

from time to time the hdd industry has experienced periods of imbalance between supply and demand to the extent that the disk drive industry builds or maintains capacity based on expectations of demand that do not materialize price erosion may become more pronounced conversely during periods where demand exceeds supply price erosion is generally muted 

price erosion 

historically our industry has been characterized by price declines for disk drive products with comparable capacity performance and feature sets likeforlike products price declines for likeforlike products price erosion have been more pronounced during periods of 

• economic contraction in which competitors may use discounted pricing to attempt to maintain or gain market share • few new product introductions when competitors have comparable or alternative product offerings and • industry supply exceeding demand disk drive manufacturers typically attempt to offset price erosion with an improved mix of disk drive products characterized by higher capacity better performance and additional feature sets and product cost reductions 

we believe the hdd industry experienced benign price erosion in fiscal year 2014 whereas price erosion increased in fiscal years 2015 and 2016 

product life cycles and changing technology success in our industry has been dependent to a large extent on the ability to balance the introduction and transition of new products with timetovolume performance capacity and quality metrics at a competitive price level of service and support that our customers expect generally the drive manufacturer that introduces a new product first benefits from improved product mix favorable profit margins and less pricing pressure until comparable products are introduced changing technology also necessitates ongoing investments in research and development which may be difficult to recover due to rapid product life cycles and economic declines further there is a continued need to successfully execute product transitions and new product introductions as factors such as quality reliability and manufacturing yields continue to be of significant competitive importance 

seasonality 

the disk drive industry traditionally experiences seasonal variability in demand with higher levels of demand in the second half of the calendar year this seasonality is driven by consumer spending in the backtoschool season from late summer to fall and the traditional holiday shopping season from fall to winter we believe fiscal year 2015 reflected seasonality consistent with historical patterns whereas in fiscal year 2014 our industry experienced more muted seasonal patterns as supply and demand were relatively in balance in fiscal year 2016 beyond traditional seasonality variability of sales was a reflection of more cyclical demand from csps based on the timing of large systems installations and the shift of the underlying technology 

fiscal year 2016 summary 

during the fiscal year 2016 we shipped 169 million units totaling 233 exabytes generating revenue of 112 billion and gross margins of 23 of revenue our operating cash flow was 17 billion we repurchased approximately 24 million of our ordinary shares during the year for approximately 11 billion paid dividends during the year of 727 million and completed our acquisition of dot hill systems corp dot hill a supplier of software and hardware storage systems for 674 million in cash 

results of operations 

we list in the tables below summarized information from our consolidated statements of operations by dollars and as a percentage of revenue 



  



the following table summarizes information regarding average drive selling prices asps excluding storage systems drive volume shipments exabytes shipped and revenues by channel and geography 



fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 

revenue 



revenue in fiscal year 2016 decreased approximately 19 or 26 billion from fiscal year 2015 as a result of a decrease in shipments by 43 million units and price erosion which were due to lower demand in the client compute market and reduced demand for mission critical hdd enterprise products partially offset by improved product mix 

cost of revenue and gross margin 



for fiscal year 2016 gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased by 500 basis points compared to the prior fiscal year due to price erosion and reduced demand in legacy hard drives resulting in underutilization of certain factories partially offset by improved product mix in the second half of fiscal year 2016 

operating expenses 



product development expense product development expenses for fiscal year 2016 decreased from fiscal year 2015 due to a decrease in salaries and other employee benefits of 63 million as a result of the restructuring of our workforce beginning in the second half of fiscal year 2015 a 29 million decrease in variable compensation and other cost reduction efforts partially offset by the consolidation of dot hill in fiscal year 2016 and lsis flash business in fiscal year 2015 

marketing and administrative expense marketing and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2016 decreased from fiscal year 2015 primarily due to a decrease in salaries and other employee benefits of 82 million as a result of a restructuring of our workforce beginning in the second half of fiscal year 2015 a 45 million decrease in variable compensation and stockbased compensation a 33 million reduction in advertising due to the completion of certain promotional and branding activities in fiscal year 2016 and increased operational efficiencies in our business 

amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles for fiscal year 2016 decreased by 6 million as compared to fiscal year 2015 as a result of certain intangible assets reaching the end of their useful lives partially offset by the amortization of intangibles acquired from the dot hill acquisition in fiscal 2016 

restructuring and other net restructuring and other net for fiscal year 2016 was comprised of restructuring charges recorded during the september 2015 quarter march 2016 quarter and june 2016 quarter to reduce our workforce by approximately 4600 employees and align our manufacturing footprint with current macroeconomic conditions 

restructuring and other net for fiscal year 2015 was due to charges to reduce our workforce as a result of our ongoing focus on cost efficiencies in all areas of our business 

gain on arbitration award net gain on arbitration award net for fiscal year 2015 was related to the final award amount of 630 million less litigation and other related costs of 10 million in the companys case against western digital for the misappropriation of the companys trade secrets 

other income expense net 



other income expense net for fiscal year 2016 increased by 83 million as compared to fiscal year 2015 primarily due to the absence of partial receipt of 143 million for interest accrued on the final arbitration award amount in the companys case against western digital in fiscal year 2015 compared to 33 million in fiscal year 2016 and a 33 million change in foreign currency remeasurement related to net gains and losses from changes in foreign exchange rates which were more pronounced in the prior year partially offset by 74 million of losses from the early redemptions and repurchases of debt in fiscal year 2015 compared to a 3 million gain from the early redemptions and repurchases of debt in fiscal year 2016 

income taxes 



we recorded an income tax provision of 26 million for fiscal year 2016 compared to an income tax provision of 228 million for fiscal year 2015 our fiscal year 2016 income tax provision included approximately 22 million of income tax benefits primarily associated with the release of tax reserves due to the expiration of certain statutes of limitation our fiscal year 2015 income tax provision included approximately 193 million of net income tax expense due to the final audit assessment received from the jiangsu province state tax bureau of the peoples republic of china china assessment for calendar years 2007 through 2013 

our irish tax resident parent holding company owns various us and nonus subsidiaries that operate in multiple nonirish income tax jurisdictions our worldwide operating income is either subject to varying rates of income tax or is exempt from income tax due to tax holiday programs we operate under in malaysia singapore and thailand these tax holidays are scheduled to expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2024 

our income tax provision recorded for fiscal year 2016 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying the irish statutory rate of 25 to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i tax benefits related to nonus earnings generated in jurisdictions that are subject to tax holidays or tax incentive programs and are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of ireland ii tax benefits associated with the reversal of previously recorded taxes and iii a decrease in valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets the acquisition of dot hill system corporation did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate our income tax provision recorded for fiscal year 2015 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying the irish statutory rate of 25 to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i tax benefits related to nonus earnings generated in jurisdictions that are subject to tax holidays or tax incentive programs and are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of ireland ii tax expense associated with the china assessment recorded during the december 2014 quarter and iii an increase in valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets the acquisition of lsis flash business did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate 

on december 18 2015 the protecting americans from tax hikes path act of 2015 was enacted among other provisions the path act retroactively reinstated and permanently extended the federal research and development rd tax credit from december 31 2014 the permanent extension of the rd credit had no immediate impact on our income tax provision due to valuation allowances on our us deferred tax assets none of the other path act changes had a material impact on our income tax provision 

based on our nonus ownership structure and subject to i potential future increases in our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and ii a future change in our intention to indefinitely reinvest earnings from our subsidiaries outside of ireland we anticipate that our effective tax rate in future periods will generally be less than the irish statutory rate 

at july 1 2016 our deferred tax asset valuation allowance was approximately 984 million 

at july 1 2016 we had net deferred tax assets of 606 million the realization of these deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on our ability to generate sufficient us and certain nonus taxable income in future periods although realization is not assured we believe that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable however may increase or decrease in subsequent periods when we reevaluate the underlying basis for our estimates of future us and certain nonus taxable income 

as of july 1 2016 approximately 677 million of our us net operating losses and 99 million of our tax credit carryforwards are subject to annual limitations from 1 million to 45 million pursuant to us tax law 

as of july 1 2016 and july 3 2015 we had approximately 70 million and 83 million respectively of unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would impact the effective tax rate are 70 million and 83 million as of july 1 2016 and july 3 2015 respectively subject to certain future valuation allowance offsets 

it is our policy to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes on our consolidated statements of operations during fiscal year 2016 we recognized a net income tax benefit for interest and penalties of 8 million as compared to a net income tax expense for interest and penalties of 26 million during fiscal year 2015 and 8 million during fiscal year 2014 as of july 1 2016 we had 12 million of accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits compared to 20 million in fiscal year 2015 

during the fiscal year ended july 1 2016 our unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties decreased by approximately 13 million primarily due to i reductions associated with the expiration of certain statutes of limitation of 27 million ii increases in current year unrecognized tax benefits of 11 million iii net increases in prior years unrecognized tax benefits of 4 million iv net reductions from other activity including nonus exchange gains of 1 million 

during the 12 months beginning july 2 2016 we expect that our unrecognized tax benefits could be reduced by approximately 16 million as a result of the expiration of certain statutes of limitation 

we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions globally and are required to file us federal us state and nonus income tax returns on april 4 2016 the irs approved the audit settlement reached in december 2015 regarding all disputed issues associated with our us federal income tax returns for fiscal years 2008 2009 and 2010 this audit settlement did not have a material impact on our financial statements 

we are no longer subject to tax examination of us federal income tax returns for years prior to fiscal year 2013 with respect to us state and nonus income tax returns we are generally no longer subject to tax examination for years ending prior to fiscal year 2005 

fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 

revenue 



revenue in fiscal year 2015 remained flat from fiscal year 2014 as a result of revenue contributed from our acquisitions of xyratex and lsis flash business and a favorable product mix partially offset by a 4 decrease in units shipped and moderate price erosion 

cost of revenue and gross margin 



for fiscal year 2015 gross margin as a percentage of revenue remained flat from the prior fiscal year as a result of improved product mix and cost savings due to increased operational efficiencies offset by moderate price erosion 

operating expenses 



product development expense product development expenses for fiscal year 2015 increased from fiscal year 2014 mostly due to an increase in headcount related costs of 111 million attributed to the consolidation of xyratex and lsis flash business as well as a 53week fiscal year in 2015 compared to 52 weeks in 2014 

marketing and administrative expense marketing and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2015 increased from fiscal year 2014 primarily due to an increase in headcount related costs of 50 million attributed to the consolidation of xyratex and lsis flash business nonrecurring legal cost reimbursement received in fiscal year 2014 of 24 million as well as a 53week fiscal year in 2015 compared to 52 weeks in 2014 

amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles for fiscal year 2015 increased by 31 million as compared to fiscal year 2014 as a result of the acquisitions of lsis flash business and xyratex 

restructuring and other net restructuring and other net for fiscal year 2015 increased by 8 million as compared to fiscal year 2014 primarily due to a restructuring charge recorded during the march 2015 quarter to reduce workforce as a result of our ongoing focus on cost efficiencies in all areas of our business 

gain on arbitration award net gain on arbitration award net for fiscal year 2015 increased from fiscal year 2014 due to final award received in the amount of 630 million less litigation and other related costs of 10 million in the companys case against western digital for the misappropriation of the companys trade secrets 

other income expense net 



other income expense net for fiscal year 2015 decreased by 132 million as compared to fiscal year 2014 primarily due to the partial payment of 143 million for interest accrued on the final arbitration award amount in our case against western digital and a decrease in losses from early redemption and repurchase of debt of 15 million partially offset by a 12 million increase in interest expense 

income taxes 



we recorded an income tax provision of 228 million for fiscal year 2015 compared to an income tax benefit of 14 million for fiscal year 2014 our fiscal year 2015 income tax provision included approximately 193 million of net income tax expense due to the final audit assessment received from the jiangsu province state tax bureau of the peoples republic of china china assessment for calendar years 2007 through 2013 our fiscal year 2014 benefit from income taxes included 58 million of income tax benefits related to the reversal of a portion of the valuation allowances recorded in prior periods and a net decrease in tax reserves related to audit settlements offset by tax reserves on nonus tax positions taken in prior fiscal years 

our income tax provision recorded for fiscal year 2015 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying the irish statutory rate of 25 to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i tax benefits related to nonus earnings generated in jurisdictions that are subject to tax holidays or tax incentive programs and are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of ireland ii tax expense associated with the china assessment recorded during the december 2014 quarter and iii an increase in valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets the acquisition of lsis flash business did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate our income tax benefit recorded for fiscal year 2014 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying the irish statutory rate of 25 to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i tax benefits related to nonus earnings generated in jurisdictions that are subject to tax holidays or tax incentive programs and are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of ireland and ii a decrease in valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets the acquisition of xyratex did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2014 fiscal year 2014 included a valuation allowance release associated with postacquisition restructuring 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following sections discuss our principal liquidity requirements as well as our sources and uses of cash and our liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase our shortterm investments consist primarily of money market funds and certificates of deposits the principal objectives of our investment policy are the preservation of principal and maintenance of liquidity we believe our cash equivalents and shortterm investments are liquid and accessible we operate in some countries that have restrictive regulations over the movement of cash andor foreign exchange across their borders however these restrictions have not impeded our ability to conduct our business nor do we expect them to in the next 12 months we are not aware of any downgrades losses or other significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or shortterm investments and we do not believe the fair value of our shortterm investments has significantly changed from the values reported as of july 1 2016 

cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments 



our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments decreased from july 3 2015 as a result of net cash outflows for the acquisition of dot hill of 674 million repurchase of our ordinary shares of 11 billion dividends paid to our shareholders of 727 million and capital expenditures of 587 million these cash outflows were partially offset by our net cash provided by operating activities the following table summarizes results from the statement of cash flows for the periods indicated 



cash provided by operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year2016 was approximately 17 billion and includes the effects of net income adjusted for noncash items including depreciation and amortization stockbased compensation and 

• a decrease in revenue accelerating a reduction in the cash conversion cycle leading to a decrease in working capital cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2015 was approximately 26 billion and includes the effects of net income adjusted for noncash items including depreciation amortization stockbased compensation net income includes 

• a partial payment of 773 million for the arbitration award and related accrued interest received from western digital and • a 225 million payment related to the final audit assessment received from the jiangsu province state tax bureau of the peoples republic of china for tax and interest associated with changes to our tax filings for the calendar years 2007 through 2013 cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2014 was approximately 26 billion and includes the effects of net income adjusted for noncash items including depreciation amortization stockbased compensation and 

• a decrease of 217 million in vendor nontrade receivables primarily related to a change in the contractual relationship with some of our contract manufacturers which reduced the volume of components we sold to them • a decrease of 190 million in accounts payable due to a change in the contractual relationship with some of our contract manufacturers which resulted in a reduction in direct materials purchased and subsequently sold to our contract manufacturers and • a decrease of 104 million in restricted cash and investments primarily due to the restricted cash and investments held in a rabbi trust being replaced with a standby letter of credit cash used in investing activities 

in fiscal year 2016 we used 12 billion for net cash investing activities which was primarily due to payments for the purchase of property equipment and leasehold improvements of approximately 587 million and the acquisition of dot hill net of cash acquired for 634 million 

in fiscal year 2015 we used 13 billion for net cash investing activities which was primarily due to payments for the purchase of property equipment and leasehold improvements of approximately 747 million and the acquisition of lsis flash business for 450 million 

in fiscal year 2014 we used 03 billion for net cash investing activities which was primarily due to payments for property equipment and leasehold improvements of approximately 559 million and the acquisition of xyratex for 285 million partially offset by 508 million of proceeds from sales of shortterm investments 

cash used in financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities of 18 billion for fiscal year 2016 was primarily attributable to the following activities 

• 11 billion paid to repurchase 24 million of our ordinary shares and • 07 billion in dividends paid to our shareholders net cash used in financing activities of 15 billion for fiscal year 2015 was primarily attributable to the following activities 

• 11 billion paid to repurchase 19 million of our ordinary shares • 10 billion for the repurchase and redemption of longterm debt • 07 billion in dividends paid to our shareholders partially offset by • proceeds of 12 billion from aggregate cash generated from the issuance of our 575 senior notes due 2034 and 4875 senior notes due 2027 net cash used in financing activities of 13 billion for fiscal year 2014 was attributable to the following activities 

• 19 billion paid to repurchase 41 million of our ordinary shares • 07 billion for the repurchase and redemption of longterm debt • 06 billion in dividends paid to our shareholders partially offset by • proceeds of 18 billion from aggregate cash generated from the issuance of our 375 senior notes due in 2018 and 475 senior notes due in 2025 liquidity sources 

our primary sources of liquidity as of july 1 2016 consisted of 1 approximately 11 billion in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments 2 cash we expect to generate from operations and 3 a 700 million senior revolving credit facility 

as of july 1 2016 no borrowings had been drawn under the revolving credit facility or had been utilized for letters of credit issued under this credit facility the line of credit is available for borrowings subject to compliance with financial covenants and other customary conditions to borrowing 

the credit agreement that governs our revolving credit facility as amended contains certain covenants that we must satisfy in order to remain in compliance with the credit agreement as amended the agreement includes three financial covenants 1 minimum cash cash equivalents and marketable securities 2 a fixed charge coverage ratio and 3 a net leverage ratio on april 28 2016 the revolving credit agreement was amended in order to increase the allowable net leverage ratio to adjust for our current financial liquidity position we were in compliance with the modified covenants as of july 1 2016 and expect to be in compliance for the next 12 months 

as of july 1 2016 cash and cash equivalents held by nonirish subsidiaries was 11 billion this amount is potentially subject to taxation in ireland upon repatriation by means of a dividend into our irish parent however it is our intent to indefinitely reinvest earnings of nonirish subsidiaries outside of 

ireland and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate such earnings by means of a taxable irish dividend should funds be needed in the irish parent company and should we be unable to fund parent company activities through means other than a taxable irish dividend we would be required to accrue and pay irish taxes on such dividend 

we believe that our sources of cash will be sufficient to fund our operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months 

cash requirements and commitments 

our liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital product development and capital expenditure needs to fund scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness and to fund our dividend our ability to fund these requirements will depend on our future cash flows which are determined by future operating performance and therefore subject to prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and financial business and other factors some of which are beyond our control 

on august 2 2016 our board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of 063 per share which will be payable on october 5 2016 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on september 21 2016 

as of july 1 2016 we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our debt agreements based on our current outlook we expect to be in compliance with the covenants of our debt agreements over the next 12 months 

the carrying value of our longterm debt as of july 1 2016 and july 3 2015 was 41 billion and 42 billion respectively the table below presents the principal amounts of our outstanding longterm debt 



from time to time we may repurchase any of our outstanding ordinary shares through private open market tender offers broker assisted purchases or other means during fiscal year 2016 we repurchased approximately 24 million of our ordinary shares see item 5 market for registrants common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securitiesrepurchases of our equity securities as of july 1 2016 18 billion remained available for repurchase under our existing repurchase authorization limit all repurchases are effected as redemptions in accordance with the companys articles of association 

for fiscal year 2017 we expect capital expenditures to be below our longterm targeted range of 6 to 8 of revenue we require substantial amounts of cash to fund scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness future capital expenditures and any increased working capital requirements we will continue to evaluate and manage the retirement and replacement of existing debt and associated obligations including evaluating the issuance of new debt securities exchanging existing debt securities for other debt securities and retiring debt pursuant to privately negotiated transactions open market purchases tender offers or other means or otherwise in addition we may selectively pursue strategic alliances acquisitions and investments which may require additional capital 

contractual obligations and commitments 

our contractual cash obligations and commitments as of july 1 2016 have been summarized in the table below 



1 includes total future minimum rent expense under noncancelable leases for both occupied and vacated facilities rent expense is shown net of sublease income 2 purchase obligations are defined as contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services which are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms 3 consists of funding requirements related to strategic commitments 

as of july 1 2016 we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits and an accrual for the payment of related interest totaling 13 million none of which is expected to be settled within one year outside of one year we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlement with a taxing authority will occur 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of july 1 2016 we did not have any material offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of regulation sk 

critical accounting policies 

the methods estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements the sec has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are highly uncertain at the time of estimation based on this definition our most critical policies include establishment of sales program accruals establishment of warranty accruals accounting for income taxes and the accounting for goodwill and other longlived assets below we discuss these policies further as well as the estimates and judgments involved we also have other accounting policies and accounting estimates relating to uncollectible customer accounts valuation of inventory valuation of sharebased payments and restructuring we believe that these other accounting policies and accounting estimates either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective or it is less likely that they would have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period 

establishment of sales program accruals we establish certain distributor and oem sales programs aimed at increasing customer demand for oem sales rebates are typically based on an oem customers volume of purchases or other agreed upon rebate programs for the distribution channel these programs typically involve rebates related to a distributors level of sales order size advertising or point of sale activity and price protection adjustments we provide for these obligations at the time that revenue is recorded based on estimated requirements we estimate these contrarevenue rebates and adjustments based on various factors including price reductions during the period reported estimated future price erosion customer orders distributor sellthrough and inventory levels program participation customer claim submittals and sales returns our estimates reflect contractual arrangements but also our judgment relating to variables such as customer claim rates and attainment of program goals and inventory and sellthrough levels reported by our distribution customers currently our distributors inventories are within the historical range 

while we believe we have sufficient experience and knowledge of the market and customer buying patterns to reasonably estimate such rebates and adjustments actual market conditions or customer behavior could differ from our expectations as a result actual payments under these programs which may spread over several months after the related sale may vary from the amount accrued accordingly revenues and margins in the period in which the adjustment occurs may be affected 

significant actual variations in any of the factors upon which we base our contrarevenue estimates could have a material effect on our operating results in fiscal year 2016 sales programs were approximately 13 of gross revenue for fiscal years 2015 and 2014 total sales programs ranged from 8 to 10 of gross revenues adjustments to revenues due to under or over accruals for sales programs related to revenues reported in prior quarterly periods were approximately 01 of gross revenue in fiscal year 2016 and averaged 03 of quarterly gross revenue for fiscal year 2015 through 2014 any future shifts in the industry supplydemand balance as well as other factors may result in a more competitive pricing environment and may cause sales programs as a percentage of gross revenue to increase from the current or historical levels if such rebates and incentives trend upwards revenues and margins may be reduced 

establishment of warranty accruals we estimate probable product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized we generally warrant our products for a period of 1 to 5 years our warranty provision considers estimated product failure rates and trends including the timing of product returns during the warranty periods and estimated repair or replacement costs related to product quality issues if any we also exercise judgment in estimating our ability to sell certain repaired products should actual experience in any future period differ significantly from our estimates our future results of operations could be materially affected our judgment is subject to a greater degree of subjectivity with respect to 

newly introduced products because of limited experience with those products upon which to base our warranty estimates 

the actual results with regard to warranty expenditures could have an adverse or favorable effect on our results of operations if the actual rate of unit failure the cost to repair a unit or the actual cost required to satisfy customer claims differs from those estimates we used in determining the warranty accrual since we typically outsource our warranty repairs our repair cost is subject to periodic negotiations with vendors and may vary from our estimates we also exercise judgment in estimating our ability to sell certain repaired products to the extent such sales fall below our forecast warranty cost will be adversely impacted 

we review our warranty accrual quarterly for products shipped in prior periods and which are still under warranty any changes in the estimates underlying the accrual may result in adjustments that impact the current period gross margins and income in fiscal years 2016 2015 and 2014 net changes in estimates of prior warranty accruals as a percentage of revenue were immaterial our total warranty cost was 10 11 and 13 of revenue during fiscal years 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively while warranty cost related to new shipments exclusive of the impact of reestimates of preexisting liabilities were 11 11 and 13 respectively for the same periods changes in anticipated failure rates of specific products and significant changes in repair or replacement costs have historically been the major reasons for significant changes in prior estimates any future changes in failure rates of certain products as well as changes in repair costs or the cost of replacement parts may result in increased or decreased warranty accruals 

accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes pursuant to accounting standards codification asc topic 740 asc 740 income taxes in applying asc 740 we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits recognition of income and deductions and calculation of specific tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions the calculation of tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the internal revenue service or other tax jurisdictions if estimates of these tax liabilities are greater or less than actual results an additional tax benefit or provision will result the deferred tax assets we record each period depend primarily on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states and certain nonus jurisdictions each period we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and if necessary we adjust the valuation allowance so that net deferred tax assets are recorded only to the extent we conclude it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized if our outlook for future taxable income changes significantly our assessment of the need for a valuation allowance may also change 

assessing goodwill and other longlived assets for impairment we account for goodwill in accordance with asc topic 350 intangibles—goodwill and other as permitted by asc 350 we perform a qualitative assessment in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist to determine if any events or circumstances exist such as an adverse change in business climate or a decline in the overall industry that would indicate that it would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount based on the qualitative assessment if it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then the company is not required to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test if it is determined in the qualitative assessment that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not below its carrying amount including goodwill then we perform a quantitative twostep impairment test the first step identifying a potential impairment compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value the second step would need to be conducted the second step measuring the impairment loss compares the implied fair value of 

the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill any excess of the reporting unit goodwill carrying value over its implied fair value is recognized as an impairment loss 

in accordance with asc 360054 impairment or disposal of longlived assets we test other longlived assets including property equipment and leasehold improvements and other intangible assets subject to amortization for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of those assets may not be recoverable we assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable we will estimate the fair value of the asset group and compare it to its carrying value the excess of the carrying value over the fair value is allocated pro rata to derive the adjusted carrying value of each asset in the asset group the adjusted carrying value of each asset in the asset group is not reduced below its fair value

hyperscale data centers increasingly large hyperscale data center companies are designing their own storage subsystems and having those built by contract manufacturers for use inside their own data centers this trend is reshaping the storage system and subsystem market and driving innovation in system design and changes in the competitive landscape of the large storage system vendors 

demand for electronic data storage 

the continued advancement of the cloud the proliferation of a variety of mobile devices globally development of the internet of things increasingly pervasive use of video surveillance evolution of consumer electronic devices and enterprise use of big data analytics are driving the growth of digital content factors contributing to this growth include 

• creation sharing and consumption of mediarich digital content such as highresolution photos high definition video and digital music through smart phones tablets digital cameras personal video cameras dvrs gaming consoles or other digital devices • creation aggregation and distribution of digital content through services and other offerings such as facebook® instagram® itunes® linkedin® netflix® pandora® google® and youtube® • new surveillance systems which feature higher resolution digital cameras and thus require larger data storage capacities • creation and collection of data through the evolution of the internet of things ecosystem big data analytics and new technology trends such as selfdriving cars and drones • build out of large numbers of cloud data centers by cloud service providers and private companies transitioning onsite data centers into the cloud • protection of increased digital content through redundant storage on backup devices and externally provided storage services as a result of these factors the nature and volume of content being created requires greater storage which is more efficiently and economically facilitated by higher capacity storage devices in order to store manage distribute analyze and backup such content we expect this to support the growth in demand for electronic data storage solutions in developed and emerging economies well into the future 

the amount of data created as well as where and how data is stored continues to evolve with the proliferation of mobile devices the growth of cloud computing and the evolving internet of things in addition the economics of storage infrastructure are also evolving with the utilization of public and private hyperscale storage and opensource solutions reducing the total cost of ownership of storage while increasing the speed and efficiency with which customers can leverage massive computing and storage devices accordingly we expect these trends will continue to create significant demand for electronic data storage solutions going forward 

demand trends for disk drives 

we believe that continued growth in digital content requires increasingly higher storage capacity in order to store aggregate host distribute analyze manage backup and use such content we also believe that as architectures evolve to serve the growing commercial and consumer user base throughout the world the manner which hard drives are delivered to market and utilized by our customers will evolve as well 

we believe that in the foreseeable future the traditional enterprise client compute markets that require high capacity storage solutions and the data intensive client noncompute markets will continue to 

be best served by hard disk drives due to the industrys ability to deliver the most cost effective reliable and energy efficient mass storage devices furthermore the increased use of client noncompute devices that both consume mediarich digital content streamed from the cloud and create rich digital content that is stored in the cloud increases the demand for high capacity hard disk drives in enterprise nearline applications 

industry supply balance 

from time to time the hdd industry has experienced periods of imbalance between supply and demand to the extent that the disk drive industry builds or maintains capacity based on expectations of demand that do not materialize price erosion may become more pronounced conversely during periods where demand exceeds supply price erosion is generally muted 

our business 

disk drive technology 

the design and manufacturing of disk drives depends on highly advanced technology and manufacturing techniques and therefore requires high levels of research and development spending and capital equipment investments we design fabricate and assemble a number of the most important components found in our disk drives including readwrite heads and recording media our design and manufacturing operations are based on technology platforms that are used to produce various disk drive products that serve multiple data storage applications and markets our core technology platforms are focused around the areal density of media and readwrite head technologies using an integrated platform design and manufacturing leverage approach allows us to deliver a portfolio of disk drive products to service a wide range of electronic data storage applications and industries 

disk drives that we manufacture are commonly differentiated by the following key characteristics 

• storage capacity commonly expressed in gigabytes gb or terabytes tb which is the amount of data that can be stored on the disk drive • spindle rotation speed commonly expressed in revolutions per minute rpm which has an effect on speed of access to data • interface transfer rate commonly expressed in megabytes per second which is the rate at which data moves between the disk drive and the computer controller • average seek time commonly expressed in milliseconds which is the time needed to position the heads over a selected track on the disk surface • data transfer rate commonly expressed in megabytes per second which is the rate at which data is transferred to and from the disk drive • inputoutput operations per second iops commonly expressed in megabytes per second which is the maximum number of reads and writes to a storage location • product quality and reliability commonly expressed in annualized return rates and • energy efficiency commonly measured by the power output necessary to operate the disk drive areal density is a measure of storage capacity per square inch on the recording surface of a disk the storage capacity of a disk drive is determined by the number of disks it contains as well as the areal density capability of these disks we have been pursuing and will continue to pursue a number of technologies to increase areal densities across the entire range of our products for expanding disk drive capacities and reducing the number of disks and heads per drive to further reduce product costs 

manufacturing 

we design and produce our own readwrite heads and recording media which are critical technologies for disk drives this integrated approach enables us to lower costs and to improve the functionality of components so that they work together efficiently 

we believe that because of our vertical design and manufacturing strategy we are well suited to take advantage of the opportunities to leverage the close interdependence of components for disk drives our manufacturing efficiency and flexibility are critical elements of our integrated business strategy we continuously seek to improve our manufacturing efficiency and reduce manufacturing cost by 

• employing manufacturing automation • improving product quality and reliability • integrating our supply chain with suppliers and customers to enhance our demand visibility and reduce our working capital requirements • coordinating between our manufacturing group and our research and development organization to rapidly achieve volume manufacturing and • operating our facilities at optimal capabilities a vertically integrated model however tends to have less flexibility when demand moderates as it exposes us to higher unit costs as capacity utilization is not optimized 

components and raw materials 

disk drives incorporate certain components including a head disk assembly and a printed circuit board mounted to the head disk assembly which are sealed inside a rigid base and top cover containing the recording components in a contamination controlled environment we maintain a highly integrated approach to our business by designing and manufacturing a significant portion of the components we view as critical to our products such as recording heads and media 

readwrite heads the function of the readwrite head is to scan across the disk as it spins magnetically recording or reading information the tolerances of recording heads are extremely demanding and require stateoftheart equipment and processes our readwrite heads are manufactured with thinfilm and photolithographic processes similar to those used to produce semiconductor integrated circuits though challenges in magnetic film properties and topographical structures are unique to the disk drive industry we perform all primary stages of design and manufacture of readwrite heads at our facilities we use a combination of internally manufactured and externally sourced readwrite heads the mix of which varies based on product mix technology and our internal capacity levels 

media information is written to the media or disk as it rotates at very high speeds past the readwrite head the media is made from nonmagnetic material usually aluminum alloy or glass and is coated with thin layers of magnetic materials we use a combination of internally manufactured and externally sourced finished media and aluminum substrates the mix of which varies based on product mix technology and our internal capacity levels we purchase all of our glass substrates from third parties which we use in the disk drives we make for mobile products 

printed circuit board assemblies the printed circuit board assemblies pcbas are comprised of standard and custom asics and ancillary electronic control chips the asics control the movement of data to and from the readwrite heads and through the internal controller and interface which communicates with the host computer the asics and control chips form electronic circuitry that delivers instructions to a head positioning mechanism called an actuator to guide the heads to the selected track of a disk where the data is recorded or retrieved disk drive manufacturers use one or more industry standard 

interfaces such as serial advanced technology architecture sata small computer system interface scsi serial attached scsi sas or fibre channel fc to communicate to the host systems we outsource to third parties the manufacture and assembly of the pcbas used in our disk drives we do not manufacture any asics but we participate in their proprietary design 

head disk assembly the head disk assembly consists of one or more disks attached to a spindle assembly powered by a spindle motor that rotates the disks at a high constant speed around a hub readwrite heads mounted on an arm assembly similar in concept to that of a record player fly extremely close to each disk surface and record data on and retrieve it from concentric tracks in the magnetic layers of the rotating disks the readwrite heads are mounted vertically on an eshaped assembly eblock that is actuated by a voicecoil motor to allow the heads to move from track to track the eblock and the recording media are mounted inside the head disk assembly we purchase spindle motors from outside vendors and from time to time participate in the design of the motors that go into our products we use a combination of internally manufactured and externally sourced head disk assemblies 

disk drive assembly following the completion of the head disk assembly it is mated to the pcba and the completed unit goes through extensive defect mapping and testing prior to packaging and shipment disk drive assembly and test operations occur primarily at facilities located in china and thailand we perform subassembly and component manufacturing operations at our facilities in china malaysia northern ireland singapore thailand and in the united states in addition third parties manufacture and assemble components and disk drive assemblies for us in various countries worldwide 

suppliers of components and industry constraints there are a limited number of independent suppliers of components such as recording heads and media available to disk drive manufacturers vertically integrated disk drive manufacturers who manufacture their own components are less dependent on external component suppliers than less vertically integrated disk drive manufacturers 

commodity and other manufacturing costs the production of disk drives requires rare earth elements precious metals scarce alloys and industrial commodities which are subject to fluctuations in prices and the supply of which has at times been constrained in addition to increased costs of components and commodities volatility in fuel costs may also increase our costs related to commodities manufacturing and freight as a result we may increase our use of ocean shipments to help offset any increase in freight costs

customers 

we sell our products to major oems distributors and retailers 

the following table summarizes our revenue by channel and by geography 



1 revenue is attributed to countries based on the shipping location 

oem customers typically enter into master purchase agreements with us these agreements provide for pricing volume discounts order lead times product support obligations and other terms and conditions including sales programs offered to promote selected products deliveries are scheduled only after receipt of purchase orders in addition with limited leadtime customers may defer most purchase orders without significant penalty anticipated orders from many of our customers have in the past failed to materialize or oem delivery schedules have been deferred or altered as a result of changes in their business needs 

our distributors generally enter into nonexclusive agreements for the resale of our products they typically furnish us with a nonbinding indication of their nearterm requirements and product deliveries are generally scheduled accordingly the agreements and related sales programs typically provide the distributors with limited right of return and price protection rights in addition we offer sales programs to distributors on a quarterly and periodic basis to promote the sale of selected products in the sales channel 

our retail channel consists of our branded storage products sold to retailers either by us directly or by our distributors retail sales made by us or our distributors typically require greater marketing support sales incentives and price protection periods 

in fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 dell inc accounted for approximately 14 13 and 13 of consolidated revenue respectively while hewlettpackard company accounted for approximately 12 13 and 10 of consolidated revenue respectively see item 1a risk factorsrisks related to our businesswe may be adversely affected by the loss of or reduced delayed or canceled purchases by one or more of our larger customers 

competition 

we compete primarily with manufacturers of hard drives used in the enterprise client compute and client noncompute applications in addition to manufacturers of solidstate drives and pcie accelerator cards the markets that we compete in are competitive disk drive manufacturers compete for a limited number of major disk drive customers but also compete with other companies in the electronic data storage industry that provide ssds and pcie technology some of the principal factors used by customers to differentiate among electronic data storage solutions manufacturers are storage capacity product performance product quality and reliability price per unit and price per gigabyte timetomarket and timetovolume leadership storageretrieval access times data transfer rates form factor product warranty and support capabilities supply continuity and flexibility power consumption total cost of ownership and brand while different markets and customers place varying levels of emphasis on these factors we believe that our products are competitive with respect to each of these factors in the markets that we currently address 

principal disk drive competitors there are three companies in the electronic data storage industry that manufacture disk drives 

• seagate selling the seagate lacie and samsung brands • western digital corporation operating the western digital and hitachi global storage technologies subsidiaries and • toshiba corporation other competitors we may in the future face indirect competition from customers who from time to time evaluate whether to offer electronic data storage products that may compete with our products 

price erosion historically our industry has been characterized by price declines for disk drive products with comparable capacity performance and feature sets likeforlike products price declines for likeforlike products price erosion have been more pronounced during periods of 

• economic contraction in which competitors may use discounted pricing to attempt to maintain or gain market share • few new product introductions when competitors have comparable or alternative product offerings and • industry supply exceeding demand disk drive manufacturers typically attempt to offset price erosion with an improved mix of disk drive products characterized by higher capacity better performance and additional feature sets andor product cost reductions 

we believe the hdd industry experienced benign price erosion in fiscal years 2013 2014 and moderate price erosion in fiscal year 2015 

product life cycles and changing technology success in our industry has been dependent to a large extent on the ability to balance the introduction and transition of new products with timetovolume performance capacity and quality metrics at a competitive price level of service and support that our customers expect generally the drive manufacturer that introduces a new product first benefits from improved product mix favorable profit margins and less pricing pressure until comparable products are introduced changing technology also necessitates ongoing investments in research and development which may be difficult to recover due to rapid product life cycles and economic declines further there is a continued need to successfully execute product transitions and new product introductions as factors such as quality reliability and manufacturing yields continue to be of significant competitive importance 

seasonality 

the disk drive industry traditionally experiences seasonal variability in demand with higher levels of demand in the second half of the calendar year this seasonality is driven by consumer spending in the backtoschool season from late summer to fall and the traditional holiday shopping season from fall to winter in fiscal years 2013 and 2014 our industry experienced muted seasonal patterns as supply and demand were relatively in balance however we believe fiscal year 2015 reflected a seasonal pattern consistent with historical patterns 

research and development 

we are committed to developing new component technologies products and alternative storage technologies our research and development focus is designed to bring new products to market in high volume with quality attributes that our customers expect before our competitors part of our product development strategy is to leverage a design platform andor subsystem within product families to serve 

different market needs this platform strategy allows for more efficient resource utilization leverages best design practices reduces exposure to changes in demand and allows for achievement of lower costs through purchasing economies our advanced technology integration effort focuses disk drive and component research on recording subsystems including readwrite heads and recording media marketspecific product technology and technology focused towards new business opportunities the primary purpose of our advanced technology integration effort is to ensure timely availability of mature component technologies to our product development teams as well as allowing us to leverage and coordinate those technologies in the design centers across our products in order to take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace during fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 we had product development expenses of approximately 1353 million 1226 million and 1133 million respectively which represented 10 9 and 8 of our consolidated revenue respectively 

patents and licenses 

as of july 3 2015 we had 5194 us patents and 1207 patents issued in various foreign jurisdictions as well as 1351 us and 1296 foreign patent applications pending the number of patents and patent applications will vary at any given time as part of our ongoing patent portfolio management activity due to the rapid technological change that characterizes the electronic data storage industry we believe that in addition to patent protection the improvement of existing products reliance upon trade secrets protection of unpatented proprietary knowhow and development of new products are also important to our business in establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage accordingly we intend to continue our efforts to broadly protect our intellectual property including obtaining patents where available in connection with our research and development program 

we have patent licenses with a number of companies additionally as part of our normal intellectual property practices we may be engaged in negotiations with other major electronic data storage companies and component manufacturers with respect to patent licenses 

the electronic data storage industry is characterized by significant litigation relating to patent and other intellectual property rights because of rapid technological development in the electronic data storage industry some of our products have been and in the future could be alleged to infringe existing patents of third parties from time to time we receive claims that our products infringe patents of third parties although we have been able to resolve some of those claims or potential claims by obtaining licenses or rights under the patents in question without a material adverse affect on us other claims have resulted in adverse decisions or settlements in addition other claims are pending which if resolved unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations for more information on these claims see item 8 financial statements and supplementary datanote 14 legal environmental and other contingencies the costs of engaging in intellectual property litigation in the past have been and in the future may be substantial irrespective of the merits of the claim or the outcome 

backlog 

in view of industry practice whereby customers may cancel or defer orders with little or no penalty we believe backlog in the disk drive industry is of limited indicative value in estimating future performance and results 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to us and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites some of our 

operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution and these permits are subject to modification renewal and revocation by issuing authorities 

we have established environmental management systems and continually update environmental policies and standard operating procedures for our operations worldwide we believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws regulations and permits we budget for operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental laws if additional or more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future we could incur additional operating costs and capital expenditures 

some environmental laws such as the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended the superfund law and its state equivalents can impose liability for the cost of cleanup of contaminated sites upon any of the current or former site owners or operators or upon parties who sent waste to these sites regardless of whether the owner or operator owned the site at the time of the release of hazardous substances or the lawfulness of the original disposal activity we have been identified as a potentially responsible party at several sites at each of these sites we have an assigned portion of the financial liability based on the type and amount of hazardous substances disposed of by each party at the site and the number of financially viable parties we have fulfilled our responsibilities at some of these sites and remain involved in only a few at this time 

while our ultimate costs in connection with these sites is difficult to predict with complete accuracy based on current estimates of cleanup costs and our expected allocation of these costs we do not expect costs in connection with these sites to be material 

we may be subject to various state federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment including those restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products for example the european union eu enacted the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment which prohibits the use of certain substances including lead in certain products including disk drives put on the market after july 1 2006 similar legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions including in the united states canada mexico taiwan china japan and others the european union reach directive registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals ec 19072006 also restricts substances of very high concern svhcs in products 

employees 

at july 3 2015 we employed approximately 52350 employees and temporary employees worldwide of which approximately 41800 employees were located in our asian operations we believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees at all levels we believe that our employee relations are good

 item 1a risk factors 

if we fail to predict demand accurately for our products in any quarter we may not be able to recapture the cost of our investments 

our industry operates primarily on quarterly purchasing cycles with much of the order flow in any given quarter typically coming at the end of that quarter our manufacturing process requires us to make significant productspecific investments in inventory in each quarter for that quarters production since we typically receive the bulk of our orders late in a quarter after we have made our investments there is a risk that our orders will not be sufficient to allow us to recapture the costs of our investment before the products resulting from that investment have become obsolete we cannot assure you that we will be able to accurately predict demand in the future 

our revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent upon customer orders in that quarter we attempt to project future orders based in part on estimates from our major customers our customers estimated requirements are not always accurate and we therefore cannot predict our quarterly revenues with any degree of certainty in addition we derive a portion of our revenues in each quarter from a number of relatively large orders if one or more of our major customers decide to defer a purchase order or delays product acceptance in any given quarter this is likely to result in reduced total revenues for that quarter 

the difficulty in forecasting demand also increases the difficulty in anticipating our inventory requirements which may cause us to overproduce finished goods resulting in inventory writeoffs or underproduce finished goods adversely affecting our ability to meet customer requirements and our market share additionally the risk of inventory writeoffs could increase if we were to continue to hold higher inventory levels we cannot be certain that we will be able to recover the costs associated with increased inventory 

other factors that may negatively impact our ability to recapture the cost of investments in any given quarter include 

• the impact of variable demand and an aggressive pricing environment for disk drives • the impact of competitive product announcements and possible excess industry supply both with respect to particular disk drive products and with respect to competing alternative storage technology solutions such as ssds in tablet notebook and enterprise compute applications • our inability to reduce our fixed costs to match sales in any quarter because of our vertical manufacturing strategy which means that we make more capital investments than we would if we were not vertically integrated • dependence on our ability to successfully qualify manufacture and sell in increasing volumes on a costeffective basis and with acceptable quality our disk drive products particularly the new disk drive products with lower cost structures • uncertainty in the amount of purchases from our distributor customers who from time to time constitute a large portion of our total sales • our product mix and the related margins of the various products • accelerated reduction in the price of our disk drives due to technological advances andor an oversupply of disk drives in the market and shifting trends in demand which can create supply and demand imbalances • manufacturing delays or interruptions particularly at our manufacturing facilities in china malaysia northern ireland singapore thailand the united kingdom or the united states • limited access to components that we obtain from a single or a limited number of suppliers 17 

• the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the cost of producing our products and the effective price of our products to foreign consumers and • operational issues arising out of the increasingly automated nature of our manufacturing processes in addition the demand for client noncompute products can be even more volatile and unpredictable than the demand for client compute products in some cases our products manufactured for client noncompute applications are uniquely configured for a single customers application which creates a risk of unwanted and unsellable inventory if the anticipated volumes are not realized this potential for unpredictable volatility is increased by the possibility of competing alternative storage technologies like flash memory meeting the customers cost and capacity metrics resulting in a rapid shift in demand from our products and disk drive technology generally to alternative storage technologies unpredictable fluctuations in demand for our products or rapid shifts in demand from our products to alternative storage technologies in new client noncompute applications could materially adversely impact our future results of operations 

market acceptance of new product introductions cannot be accurately predicted and our results of operations will suffer if there is less demand for our new products than is anticipated 

the markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product introductions and technology enhancements uncertain product life cycles and changes in customer demand the success of our new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors including market acceptance our ability to manage the risks associated with product transitions the effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand and the risk that our new products will have quality problems or other defects in the early stages of introduction that were not anticipated in the design of those products accordingly we cannot accurately determine the ultimate effect that our new products will have on our results of operations 

historically our results of operations have substantially depended upon our ability to be among the firsttomaturity with new product offerings our market share and results of operations in the future may be adversely affected if we fail to 

• consistently maintain our timetomaturity performance with our new products • produce these products in sufficient volume • qualify these products with key customers on a timely basis by meeting our customers performance and quality specifications or • achieve acceptable manufacturing yields quality and costs with these products in addition the success of our new product introductions is dependent upon our ability to qualify as a primary source of supply with our oem customers in order for our products to be considered by our customers for qualification we must be among the leaders in timetomarket with those new products once a product is accepted any failure or delay in the qualification process or a requirement that we requalify can result in our losing sales to that customer until new products are introduced the limited number of highvolume oems magnifies the effect of missing a product qualification opportunity these risks are further magnified because we expect competitive pressures to result in declining sales eroding prices and declining gross margins on our current generation products if the delivery of our products is delayed our oem customers may use our competitors products to meet their production requirements we cannot assure that we will be among the leaders in timetomarket with new products or that we will be able to successfully qualify new products with our customers in the future 

we face the related risk that consumers and businesses may wait to make their purchases if they want to buy a new product that has been shipped or announced but not yet released if this were to occur we may be unable to sell our existing inventory of products that may be less efficient and cost effective 

compared to new products as a result even if we are among the firsttomaturity with a given product subsequent introductions or announcements by our competitors of new products could cause us to lose revenue and not achieve a positive return on our investment in existing products and inventory 

if we cannot successfully deliver competitive products our future results of operations may be adversely affected 

our industries are highly competitive and our failure to anticipate and respond to technological and market developments could harm our ability to compete 

we operate in markets that are highly competitive and subject to rapid change and that are significantly affected by new product introductions substantial price erosion and lower prices as part of a strategy to gain or retain market share and customers should these practices continue we may need to continually reduce our prices for existing products to retain our market share which could adversely affect our results of operations 

our ability to offset the effect of price erosion through new product introductions at higher average prices is diminished to the extent competitors introduce products into particular markets ahead of our similar competing products our ability to offset the effect of price erosion is also diminished during times when supply exceeds demand for a particular product 

market share for our products can be negatively affected by our customers diversifying their sources of supply as our competitors enter the market for particular products as well as by our ability to ramp volume production of new product offerings when our competitors successfully introduce product offerings that are competitive with our recently introduced products our customers may quickly diversify their sources of supply any significant decline in our market share in any of our principal market applications would adversely affect our results of operations 

our principal sources of competition include 

• disk drive manufacturers such as western digital corporation and toshiba • companies providing storage subsystems and components to oems • electronic manufacturing services ems companies acquiring the necessary skills and intellectual property to enter the enterprise data storage marketplace • other high performance computing hpc data storage providers • collaborations between inhouse development teams of existing and potential customers and a combination of ems contract electronic manufacturing cem or emerging technology companies we also experience competition from other companies that produce alternative storage technologies like flash memory where increasing capacity decreasing cost energy efficiency and improvements in performance ruggedness have resulted in competition with our lower capacity smaller form factor disk drives while this competition has traditionally been in the markets for handheld consumer electronics applications these competitors have announced solid state drives ssds for tablet notebook and enterprise compute applications certain customers for both notebook and enterprise compute applications are adopting ssds as alternatives to hard drives in certain applications further adoption of these alternative storage technologies may impact the competitiveness of our product portfolio and reduce our market share and adversely affect our results of operation 

the markets for our data storage system products are also characterized by technological change driven in part by the adoption of new industry standards these standards provide mechanisms to ensure technology component interoperability can occur and may reduce our capability for differentiation or innovation and our affected products would revert to commodity status this could lower the barriers to 

entry to our market away from our specialist research and development skills and enable entry for the generalpurpose design skills found in some large ems and cem companies commodity markets are driven by extremely low margins and very aggressive competitive pricing if our market becomes more commoditized and we fail to deliver innovative valueadded alternatives to our customers we will have difficulty competing against the larger ems and cem companies if we are unable to compete successfully against our current and future competitors we could experience profit margin reductions or loss of market share which could significantly harm our financial condition 

if we do not develop products in time to keep pace with technological changes our results of operations will be adversely affected 

our customers have demanded new generations of disk drive products as advances in computer hardware and software have created the need for improved storage products with features such as increased storage capacity improved performance and reliability and lower cost we and our competitors have developed improved products and we will need to continue to do so in the future such product development requires significant investments in research and development we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully complete the design or introduction of new products in a timely manner that we will be able to manufacture new products in sufficient volumes with acceptable manufacturing yields that we will be able to successfully market these new products or that these products will perform to specifications on a longterm basis in addition the impact of slowing areal density growth may adversely impact our ability to be successful 

when we develop new products with higher capacity and more advanced technology our results of operations may decline because the increased difficulty and complexity associated with producing these products increases the likelihood of reliability quality or operability problems if our products suffer increases in failures are of low quality or are not reliable customers may reduce their purchases of our products and our manufacturing rework and scrap costs and service and warranty costs may increase in addition a decline in the reliability of our products may make us less competitive as compared with other disk drive manufacturers or competing technologies 

changes in demand for computer systems and storage subsystems may in the future cause a decline in demand for our products 

our products are components in computers data storage systems and consumer electronics devices the demand for these products has been volatile unexpected slowdowns in demand for computer systems storage subsystems or consumer electronics devices generally cause sharp declines in demand for our products declines in consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services and on our financial condition and results of operations 

causes of declines in demand for our products in the past have included weakness in macroeconomic environments announcements or introductions of major new operating systems or semiconductor improvements or changes in consumer preferences such as the shift to mobile devices we believe these announcements and introductions have from time to time caused consumers to defer their purchases and made inventory obsolete whenever an oversupply of our products causes participants in our industry to have higher than anticipated inventory levels we experience even more intense price competition from other manufacturers than usual 

increases in the areal density of disk drives may outpace customers demand for storage capacity 

the rate of increase in areal density or storage capacity per square inch on a disk may be greater than the increase in our customers demand for aggregate storage capacity particularly in certain market applications like client compute as a result our customers storage capacity needs may be satisfied with 

lower priced low capacity disk drives these factors could decrease our sales especially when combined with continued price erosion which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we may not be successful in our efforts to grow our cloud systems and solutions business 

we have made and are continuing to make investments to expand and develop our cloud systems and solutions business our cloud systems and solutions business is subject to the following risks 

• the cloud systems and solutions market may develop more slowly than we expect • we may not be able to offer compelling solutions to enterprises and consumers • our cloud systems and solutions business generally has a long and unpredictable sales cycle and growth in this business is likely to depend on relatively large customer orders which may increase the variability of our results of operations and the difficulty of matching revenues with expenses our results of operations and share price may be adversely affected if we are not successful in our efforts to grow our cloud computing business as anticipated in addition our growth in this sector may bring us into closer competition with some of our customers or potential customers which may decrease their willingness to do business with us 

changes in the macroeconomic environment have negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact our results of operations 

due to the continuing uncertainty about current macroeconomic conditions affecting consumer and enterprise spending we believe our customers may postpone spending in response to tighter credit unemployment negative financial news andor declines in income or asset values which could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products continuing high unemployment rates low levels of consumer liquidity risk of default on sovereign debt and volatility in credit and equity markets have weakened consumer confidence and decreased consumer and enterprise spending in many regions around the world other factors that could influence demand include conditions in the residential real estate and mortgage markets labor and healthcare costs access to credit consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior these and other economic factors could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and on our financial condition and operating results 

if we do not control our operating expenses we will not be able to compete effectively in our industry 

we continually seek to make our cost structure and business processes more efficient we are focused on increasing workforce flexibility and scalability and improving overall competitiveness by leveraging our global capabilities as well as external talent and skills worldwide our strategy involves to a substantial degree increasing revenue and product volume while at the same time controlling operating expenses if we do not control our operating expenses our ability to compete in the marketplace may be impaired in the past activities to reduce operating costs have included closures and transfers of facilities significant personnel reductions and efforts to increase automation the reduction of personnel and closure of facilities may adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in required volumes to meet customer demand and may result in other disruptions that affect our products and customer service our efforts to make our operations more efficient may result in restructuring and other charges 

our quarterly results of operations fluctuate sometimes significantly from period to period and may cause our share price to decline 

in the past our quarterly revenue and results of operations have fluctuated sometimes significantly from period to period these fluctuations which we expect to continue may be occasioned by a variety of factors including 

• current uncertainty in global economic conditions may pose a risk to the overall economy • adverse changes in the level of economic activity in the major regions in which we do business • competitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices by our competitors targeted to encourage shifting of customer demand • delays or problems in our introduction of new products particularly new disk drives with lower cost structures the inability to achieve high production yields or delays in customer qualification or initial product quality issues • changes in purchasing patterns by our distributor customers • application of new or revised industry standards • disruptions in our supply chain • increased costs or adverse changes in availability of supplies of raw materials or components • the impact of corporate restructuring activities that we have and may continue to engage in • changes in the demand for the computer systems and data storage products that contain our products due to seasonality economic conditions and other factors • changes in purchases from period to period by our primary customers • shifting trends in customer demand which when combined with overproduction of particular products particularly when the industry is served by multiple suppliers results in unfavorable supplydemand imbalances • our high proportion of fixed costs including research and development expenses • any impairments in goodwill or other longlived assets • announcements of new products services or technological innovations by us or our competitors and • adverse changes in the performance of our products as a result we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our revenue and results of operations may not be meaningful and that these comparisons may not be an accurate indicator of our future performance our results of operations in one or more future quarters may fail to meet the expectations of investment research analysts or investors which could cause an immediate and significant decline in the trading price of our ordinary shares 

because we experience seasonality in the sales of our products our results of operations will generally be adversely impacted during the second half of our fiscal year 

sales of computer systems storage subsystems and consumer electronics tend to be seasonal and therefore we expect to continue to experience seasonality in our business as we respond to variations in our customers demand for our products in particular we anticipate that sales of our products will continue to be lower during the second half of our fiscal year in the client compute and client noncompute market applications of our disk drive business this seasonality is partially attributable to the historical trend in our 

results derived from our customers increased sales of desktop computers notebook computers and consumer electronics during the backtoschool and winter holiday season in the enterprise market our sales are seasonal because of the capital budgeting and purchasing cycles of our end users since our working capital needs peak during periods in which we are increasing production in anticipation of orders that have not yet been received our results of operations will fluctuate seasonally even if the forecasted demand for our products proves accurate furthermore it is difficult for us to evaluate the degree to which this seasonality may affect our business in future periods because of the rate and unpredictability of product transitions and new product introductions particularly in the client noncompute market as well as macroeconomic conditions 

we have a long and unpredictable sales cycle for enterprise data storage solutions 

our enterprise data storage solutions are technically complex and we typically supply them in high quantities to a small number of customers many of our products are also tailored to meet the specific requirements of individual customers and are often integrated by our customers into the systems and products that they sell factors that affect the length of our sales cycle include 

• the time required for testing and evaluating our products before they are deployed • the size of the deployment and • the degree of system configuration necessary to deploy our products as a result our sales cycle for enterprise data storage solutions is often in excess of one year and the length of our sales cycle is frequently unpredictable in addition the emerging and evolving nature of the market for the products that we sell may lead prospective customers to postpone their purchasing decisions we invest resources and incur costs during this cycle that may not be recovered if we do not successfully conclude sales these factors lead to difficulty in matching revenues with expenses and to increased expenditures which together may adversely impact our results of operations 

we are dependent on sales to distributors and retailers which may increase price erosion and the volatility of our sales 

a substantial portion of our sales has been to distributors of disk drive products certain of our distributors may also market other products that compete with our products product qualification programs in this distribution channel are limited which increases the number of competing products that are available to satisfy demand particularly in times of lengthening product cycles as a result purchasing decisions in this channel are based largely on price terms and product availability sales volumes through this channel are also less predictable and subject to greater volatility than sales to our oem customers in addition deterioration in business and economic conditions could exacerbate price erosion and volatility as distributors lower prices to compensate for lower demand and higher inventory levels our distributors ability to access credit for purposes of funding their operations may also affect purchases of our products by these customers 

if distributors reduce their purchases of our products or prices decline significantly in the distribution channel or if distributors experience financial difficulties or terminate their relationships with us our revenues and results of operations would be adversely affected 

we believe that industry demand for storage products in the longterm is increasing due to the proliferation of mediarich digital content in consumer applications and is fueling increased consumer demand for storage this has led to the expansion of our branded solutions such as external storage products to provide additional storage capacity and to secure data in case of disaster or system failure or to provide independent storage solutions for multiple users in home or small business environments consumer spending on retail sales of our branded solutions has deteriorated in some markets and may continue to do so if poor global economic conditions continue and higher levels of unemployment persist 

this could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services and on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition such retail sales of our branded solutions traditionally experience seasonal variability in demand with higher levels of demand in the first half of our fiscal year driven by consumer spending in the backtoschool season from late summer to fall and the traditional holiday shopping season from fall to winter additionally our ability to reach such consumers depends on our maintaining effective working relationships with major retailers and distributors failure to anticipate consumer demand for our branded solutions as well as an inability to maintain effective working relationships with retail and online distributors may adversely impact our future results of operations 

we may be adversely affected by the loss of or reduced delayed or canceled purchases by one or more of our larger customers 

some of our key customers account for a large portion of our disk drive revenue while we have longstanding relationships with many of our customers if any of our key customers were to significantly reduce their purchases from us our results of operations would be adversely affected while sales to major customers may vary from period to period a major customer that permanently discontinues or significantly reduces its relationship with us could be difficult to replace in line with industry practice new customers usually require that we pass a lengthy and rigorous qualification process at the customers cost accordingly it may be difficult or costly for us to attract new major customers additionally mergers acquisitions consolidations or other significant transactions involving our customers generally entail risks to our business if a significant transaction involving any of our key customers results in the loss of or reduction in purchases by these key customers it could have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and prospects 

if we experience shortages or delays in the receipt of or cost increases in critical components equipment or raw materials necessary to manufacture our products we may suffer lower operating margins production delays and other material adverse effects 

the cost quality and supply of components subassemblies certain equipment and raw materials used to manufacture our products and key components like recording media and heads are critical to our success the equipment we use to manufacture our products and components is frequently custom made and comes from a few suppliers and the lead times required to obtain manufacturing equipment can be significant particularly important for our products include readwrite heads aluminum or glass substrates for recording media asics spindle motors printed circuit boards and suspension assemblies 

we rely on sole suppliers or a limited number of suppliers for some of these components that we do not manufacture including aluminum and glass substrates readwrite heads asics spindle motors printed circuit boards and suspension assemblies many of such component suppliers are geographically concentrated in particular in thailand which makes our supply chain more vulnerable to regional disruptions such as the severe flooding in thailand in october 2011 which had a material impact on the production and availability of many components if our vendors for these components are unable to meet our cost quality and supply requirements we could experience a shortage in supply or an increase in production costs which would adversely affect our results of operations 

certain rare earth elements are critical in the manufacture of our products we purchase components that contain rare earth elements from a number of countries including the peoples republic of china we cannot predict whether any nation will impose regulations quotas or embargoes upon the rare earth elements incorporated into our products that would restrict the worldwide supply of such metals or increase their cost we have experienced increased costs and production delays when we were unable to obtain the necessary equipment or sufficient quantities of some components andor have been forced to pay higher prices or make volume purchase commitments or advance deposits for some components 

equipment or raw materials that were in short supply in the industry in general if any major supplier were to restrict the supply available to us or increase the cost of the rare earth elements used in our products we could experience a shortage in supply or an increase in production costs which would adversely affect our results of operations 

consolidation among component manufacturers has resulted and may continue to result in some component manufacturers exiting the industry or not making sufficient investments in research to develop new components 

if there is a shortage of or delay in supplying us with critical components equipment or raw materials then 

• it is likely that our suppliers would raise their prices and if we could not pass these price increases to our customers our operating margin would decline • we might have to reengineer some products which would likely cause production and shipment delays make the reengineered products more costly and provide us with a lower rate of return on these products • we would likely have to allocate the components we receive to certain of our products and ship less of others which could reduce our revenues and could cause us to lose sales to customers who could purchase more of their required products from manufacturers that either did not experience these shortages or delays or that made different allocations and • we might be late in shipping products causing potential customers to make purchases from our competitors thus causing our revenue and operating margin to decline we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain critical components in a timely and economic manner 

we often aim to lead the market in new technology deployments and leverage unique and customized technology from single source suppliers who are early adopters in the emerging market our options in supplier selection in these cases are limited and the supplier based technology may consequently be single sourced until wider adoption of the technology occurs and any necessary licenses become available in such cases any technical issues in the suppliers technology may cause us to delay shipments of our new technology deployments and therefore harm our financial position 

our substantial leverage may place us at a competitive disadvantage in our industry 

we are leveraged and have significant debt service obligations our significant debt and debt service requirements could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities for example our high level of debt presents the following risks 

• we are required to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements • our substantial leverage increases our vulnerability to economic downturns and adverse competitive and industry conditions and could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that are less leveraged • our debt service obligations could limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry and could limit our ability to pursue other business opportunities borrow more money for operations or capital in the future and implement our business strategies 25 

• our level of debt may restrict us from raising additional financing on satisfactory terms to fund working capital capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements and • covenants in our debt instruments limit our ability to pay future dividends or make other restricted payments and investments in the event that we need to refinance all or a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures we may not be able to obtain terms as favorable as the terms of our existing debt or refinance our existing debt at all if prevailing interest rates or other factors existing at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing then the interest expense relating to the refinanced debt would increase furthermore if any rating agency changes our credit rating or outlook our debt and equity securities could be negatively affected which could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt or raise additional capital 

servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate cash may be affected by factors beyond our control 

our business may not generate cash flow in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay the principal of or interest on our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs including working capital capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements 

our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control we cannot assure you that 

• our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations • we will continue to realize the cost savings revenue growth and operating improvements that result from the execution of our longterm strategic plan or • future sources of funding will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs if we cannot fund our liquidity needs we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements we cannot assure you that any of these remedies could if necessary be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all or that they would permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations in addition if we incur additional debt the risks associated with our substantial leverage including the risk that we will be unable to service our debt or generate enough cash flow to fund our liquidity needs could intensify 

if revenues fall or customer demand decreases significantly we may not meet all of our purchase commitments to certain suppliers 

from time to time we enter into longterm noncancelable purchase commitments or make large upfront investments with certain suppliers in order to secure certain components or technologies for the production of our products or to supplement our internal manufacturing capacity for certain components if our actual revenues in the future are lower than our projections or if customer demand decreases significantly below our projections we may not meet all of our purchase commitments with these suppliers as a result it is possible that our revenues will not be sufficient to recoup our upfront investments in which case we will have to shift output from our internal manufacturing facilities to these suppliers or make penaltytype payments under these contracts 

the loss of key executive officers and employees could negatively impact our business prospects 

our future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued service of key members of management as well as marketing sales and product development personnel the loss of one or more of our key personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we believe our future success will also depend in large part upon our ability to attract retain and further motivate highly skilled management marketing sales and product development personnel we have experienced intense competition for personnel and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our key employees or that we will be successful in attracting assimilating and retaining personnel in the future 

due to the complexity of our products some defects may only become detectable after deployment 

our products are highly complex and are designed to operate in and form part of larger complex networks and storage systems defects in our products or in the networks and systems of which they form a part directly or indirectly have resulted in and may in the future result in 

• increased costs and product delays until complex solution level interoperability issues are resolved • costs associated with the remediation of any problems attributable to our products • loss of or delays in revenues • loss of customers • failure to achieve market acceptance and loss of market share • increased service and warranty costs and • increased insurance costs defects in our products could also result in legal actions by our customers for property damage injury or death product liability claims could exceed the level of insurance coverage that we have obtained to cover defects in our products any significant uninsured claims could significantly harm our financial condition 

we may not be able to identify suitable strategic alliances acquisitions joint ventures or investment opportunities to successfully acquire and integrate companies that provide complementary products or technologies or to realize the anticipated benefits of such transactions 

our growth strategy involves pursuing strategic alliances with making acquisitions of forming joint ventures with or making investments in other companies that are complementary to our business there is substantial competition for attractive strategic alliance acquisition joint venture and investment candidates accordingly we may not be able to identify suitable strategic alliances acquisition joint venture or investment candidates even if we can identify them we cannot assure you that we will be able to partner with acquire or invest in suitable candidates or integrate acquired technologies or operations successfully into our existing technologies and operations moreover our ability to finance potential strategic alliances acquisitions joint ventures or investments will be limited by our high degree of leverage the covenants contained in the instruments that govern our outstanding indebtedness and any agreements governing any other debt we may incur 

if we are successful in forming strategic alliances or acquiring forming joint ventures or making investments in other companies any of these transactions may have an adverse effect on our results of operations particularly while the operations of an acquired business are being integrated it is also likely that integration of acquired companies would lead to the loss of key employees from those companies or the loss of customers of those companies in addition the integration of any acquired companies would require substantial attention from our senior management which may limit the amount of time available to 

be devoted to our daytoday operations or to the execution of our strategy growth by strategic alliance acquisition joint venture or investment involves an even higher degree of risk to the extent we combine new product offerings and enter new markets in which we have limited experience and no assurance can be given that acquisitions of entities with new or alternative business models will be successfully integrated or achieve their stated objectives there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits of any strategic alliance acquisition joint venture or investment that we make or if we do how long it will take to achieve such benefits 

furthermore the expansion of our business involves the risk that we might not manage our growth effectively that we would incur additional debt to finance these acquisitions or investments that we may have impairment of goodwill or acquired intangible assets associated with these acquisitions and that we would incur substantial charges relating to the writeoff of inprocess research and development similar to that which we incurred in connection with several of our prior acquisitions each of these items could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we could issue additional ordinary shares in connection with future strategic alliances acquisitions joint ventures or investments issuing shares in connection with such transactions would have the effect of diluting your ownership percentage of the ordinary shares and could cause the price of our ordinary shares to decline 

we are at times subject to intellectual property legal proceedings and claims which could cause us to incur significant additional costs or prevent us from selling our products and which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject from timetotime to legal proceedings and claims including claims of alleged infringement of the patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties by us or our customers in connection with their use of our products intellectual property litigation can be expensive and timeconsuming regardless of the merits of any claim and could divert our managements attention from operating our business in addition intellectual property lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties due to the complexity of the technical issues involved which may cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations patent litigation has increased due to the current uncertainty of the law and the increasing competition and overlap of product functionality in the field some of the actions that we face from timetotime seek injunctions against the sale of our products andor substantial monetary damages which if granted or awarded could materially harm our business financial condition and operating results 

we cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of others we may not be aware of currently filed patent applications that relate to our products or technology if patents are later issued on these applications we may be liable for infringement if our products were found to infringe the intellectual property rights of others we could be required to pay substantial damages cease the manufacture use and sale of infringing products in one or more geographic locations expend significant resources to develop noninfringing technology discontinue the use of specific processes or obtain licenses to the technology infringed we might not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms or at all or be able to reengineer our products successfully to avoid infringement any of the foregoing could cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling our products which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition see item 8 financial statements and supplementary datanote 14 legal environmental and other contingencies contained in this report for a description of pending intellectual property proceedings 

we may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect our ip rights in the past we have been involved in 

significant and expensive disputes regarding our ip rights and those of others including claims that we may be infringing patents trademarks and other ip rights of thirdparties we expect that we will be involved in similar disputes in the future 

there can be no assurance that 

• any of our existing patents will continue to be held valid if challenged • patents will be issued for any of our pending applications • any claims allowed from existing or pending patents will have sufficient scope or strength to protect us or • our patents will be issued in the primary countries where our products are sold in order to protect our rights and potential commercial advantage in addition our competitors may be able to design their products around our patents and other proprietary rights enforcement of our rights often requires litigation if we bring a patent infringement action and are not successful our competitors would be able to use similar technology to compete with us moreover the defendant in such an action may successfully countersue us for infringement of their patents or assert a counterclaim that our patents are invalid or unenforceable 

furthermore we have significant operations and sales in foreign countries where intellectual property laws and enforcement policies are often less developed less stringent or more difficult to enforce than in the united states 

we are heavily dependent on our proprietary technology and our competitors may gain access to this technology 

we depend heavily on our proprietary technology and rely on a combination of patent copyright and trade secret laws to protect our intellectual property and expertise we also attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality agreements with our customers suppliers and employees and through other security measures despite these efforts we cannot give assurances that others will not gain access to our trade secrets or that we can fully protect our intellectual property in addition effective trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain countries in which we operate nor can we guarantee that our competitors will not independently develop comparable technologies we cannot rely on our patents to provide us with any significant competitive advantage failure to protect our proprietary rights could significantly harm our financial condition 

we could suffer a loss of revenue and increased costs exposure to significant liability reputational harm and other serious negative consequences if we sustain cyberattacks or other data security breaches that disrupt our operations or result in the dissemination of proprietary or confidential information about us or our customers or other thirdparties 

our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer equipment and the electronic data stored in our databases from damage by among other things earthquake fire natural disasters accidents power disruptions telecommunications failures acts of terrorism or war employee misconduct physical or electronic breakins cyberattacks or similar events or disruptions we manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our operations in addition our outsourcing services and cloud computing businesses routinely process store and transmit large amounts of data for our customers and vendors including sensitive and personally identifiable information as our operations become more automated and increasingly interdependent our exposure to the risks posed by these types of events will increase we have been and will likely continue to be subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes cyberattacks or other computerrelated attempts to breach the information technology systems we use for these purposes we may also be subject to information technology system failures and network disruptions due to these factors experienced computer 

programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of thirdparties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products in addition sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from thirdparties may contain defects in design or manufacture including bugs and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system 

the costs to us to eliminate or address the foregoing security problems and security vulnerabilities before or after a cyberincident could be significant system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions we could lose existing or potential customers for outsourcing services or other information technology solutions in connection with any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products in addition breaches of our security measures and the unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers or other thirdparties could expose us our vendors and customers or other thirdparties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business in addition we rely in certain limited capacities on thirdparty data management providers whose possible security problems and security vulnerabilities may have similar effects on us 

we are subject to laws rules and regulations in the us and other countries relating to the collection use and security of user data in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries and among us our subsidiaries and other parties with which we have commercial relations our ability to execute transactions and to possess and use personal information and data in conducting our business subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens that may require us to notify vendors customers or employees of a data security breach we have incurred and will continue to incur significant expenses to comply with mandatory privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law regulation industry standards or contractual obligations these laws protocols and standards continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices if we fail to comply with applicable federal state or international privacyrelated or data protection laws we may be subject to proceedings by governmental entities and incur penalties or significant legal liability 

our international operations subject us to risks related to disruptions in foreign markets currency exchange fluctuations longer payment cycles seasonality limitations imposed by a variety of legal and regulatory regimes potential adverse tax consequences increased costs our customers credit and access to capital healthrelated risks and access to personnel 

we have significant operations in foreign countries including manufacturing facilities sales personnel and customer support operations we have manufacturing facilities in china malaysia northern ireland singapore and thailand in addition to those in the united states a substantial portion of our client compute disk drive assembly occurs in our facility in china 

our international operations are subject to economic risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries including the following 

• disruptions in foreign markets disruptions in financial markets and the deterioration of the underlying economic conditions in the past in some countries including those in asia have had an impact on our sales to customers located in or whose enduser customers are located in these countries 30 

• fluctuations in currency exchange rates prices for our products are denominated predominately in us dollars even when sold to customers that are located outside the united states an increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside of the us where we sell in dollars this could adversely impact our sales and market share in such areas or increase pressure on us to lower our price and adversely impact our profit margins a weakened dollar could increase the cost of expenses such as payroll utilities tax and marketing expenses as well as overseas capital expenditures any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations we may attempt to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes by among other things entering into foreign currency forward exchange contracts however these contracts may not cover our full exposure and subject us to certain counterparty credit risks see item 7aquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskforeign currency exchange risk of this report for additional information about our foreign currency exchange risk • longer payment cycles our customers outside of the united states are often allowed longer time periods for payment than our us customers this increases the risk of nonpayment due to the possibility that the financial condition of particular customers may worsen during the course of the payment period • seasonality seasonal reductions in the business activities of our customers during the summer months particularly in europe typically result in lower earnings during those periods • legal and regulatory limitations our international operations are affected by limitations on imports tariffs duties currency exchange control regulations price controls export control laws including the trade and economic sanctions administered by the office of foreign assets control and other restraints on trade in addition the governments of many countries including china malaysia northern ireland singapore and thailand in which we have significant operating assets have exercised and continue to exercise significant influence over many aspects of their domestic economies and international trade although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate these or other applicable laws and regulations to which we may be subject violations of these laws and regulations could lead to significant penalties including restraints on our export or import privileges monetary fines criminal proceedings and regulatory or other actions that could materially adversely affect our results of operations • potential adverse tax consequences our international operations create a risk of potential adverse tax consequences including imposition of withholding or other taxes on payments by our subsidiaries in addition our taxable income in any jurisdiction is dependent upon acceptance of our operational practices and intercompany transfer pricing by local tax authorities as being on an arms length basis due to inconsistencies in application of the arms length standard among taxing authorities as well as a lack of adequate treatybased protection transfer pricing challenges by tax authorities could if successful substantially increase our income tax expense we are subject to tax audits around the world and are under audit in various jurisdictions and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax against us although we believe our tax positions are reasonable the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from our recorded income tax provisions and accruals the ultimate results of an audit could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made and could result in increases to our overall tax expense in subsequent periods in light of the ongoing fiscal challenges many countries are facing various levels of government are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative action to increase tax revenue in response the organization for economic cooperation and developments base erosion and profit shifting project recommendations due out by the end of calendar year 2015 will reshape international tax rules for countries to implement these potential changes in the relevant tax laws applicable to corporate 31 

multinationals along with potential changes in accounting and other laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations could increase the risk of double taxation cause increased tax audit activity and could impact our effective tax rate 

• increased costs the shipping and transportation costs associated with our international operations are typically higher than those associated with our us operations resulting in decreased operating margins in some foreign countries • credit and access to capital risks our international customers could have reduced access to working capital due to higher interest rates reduced bank lending resulting from contractions in the money supply or the deterioration in the customers or its banks financial condition or the inability to access other financing • global health outbreaks the occurrence of a pandemic disease may adversely impact our operations and some of our key customers such diseases could also potentially disrupt the timeliness and reliability of the distribution network we rely on • access to personnel there is substantial competition for qualified and capable personnel in certain jurisdictions in which we operate including china which may make it difficult for us to recruit and retain qualified employees in sufficient numbers increased difficulty in recruiting or retaining sufficient and adequate personnel in our international operations may lead to increased manufacturing and employment compensation costs which could adversely affect our results of operations political events war terrorism natural disasters public health issues and other circumstances could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

war terrorism geopolitical uncertainties natural disasters public health issues and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy and thus could have a strong negative effect on our business our suppliers logistics providers manufacturing vendors and customers our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes fire power shortages terrorist attacks other hostile acts labor disputes public health issues and other events beyond our control such events could decrease demand for our products make it difficult or impossible for us to make and deliver products to our customers or to receive components from our suppliers and create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain in the event of a natural disaster losses and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations and our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected should major public health issues including pandemics arise we could be negatively affected by stringent employee travel restrictions additional limitations in freight services governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in our operations and some of our key customers 

macroeconomic developments like the debt crisis in certain countries in the european union and slowing economies in parts of asia and south america could negatively affect our business operating results or financial condition which in turn could adversely affect our stock price a general weakening of and related declining corporate confidence in the global economy or the curtailment in government or corporate spending could cause current or potential customers to reduce their information technology it budgets or be unable to fund hardware systems which could cause customers to delay decrease or cancel purchases of our products or cause customers not to pay us or to delay paying us for previously purchased products and services 

deterioration in global credit and financial market conditions could negatively impact the value of our current portfolio of cash equivalents or shortterm investments and our ability to meet our financing objectives 

our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase our shortterm investments consist primarily of readily marketable debt securities with remaining maturities of more than 90 days at the time of purchase our investment policy has as its principal objectives the preservation of principal and maintenance of liquidity we mitigate default risk by investing in highquality investment grade securities limiting the time to maturity and by monitoring the counterparties and underlying obligors closely 

while as of the date of this filing we are not aware of any material downgrades losses or other significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or shortterm investments no assurance can be given that future deterioration in conditions of the global credit and financial markets would not negatively impact our current portfolio of cash equivalents or shortterm investments or our ability to meet our financing objectives 

the price of our ordinary shares may be volatile and could decline significantly 

the stock market in general and the market for technology stocks in particular has recently experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of companies if these market or industrybased fluctuations continue the trading price of our ordinary shares could decline significantly independent of our actual operating performance and you could lose all or a substantial part of your investment the market price of our ordinary shares could fluctuate significantly in response to several factors including among others 

• general uncertainty in stock market conditions occasioned by global economic conditions negative financial news and the continued instability of several large financial institutions • actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations • announcements of innovations new products or significant price reductions by us or our competitors including those competitors who offer alternative storage technology solutions • our failure to meet the performance estimates of investment research analysts • the timing of announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts or acquisitions • general stock market conditions • the occurrence of major catastrophic events • changes in financial estimates by investment research analysts • changes in the credit ratings of our indebtedness by rating agencies and • the sale of our ordinary shares held by certain equity investors or members of management any decision to reduce or discontinue the payment of cash dividends to our shareholders or the repurchase of our ordinary shares pursuant to our previously announced share repurchase program could cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline significantly 

although we have announced targeted regular cash dividend amounts and a share repurchase program we are under no obligation to pay cash dividends to our shareholders in the future at the announced targeted levels or at all or to repurchase our ordinary shares at any particular price or at all the declaration and payment of any future dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and our previously announced share repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time our payment of quarterly cash dividends and the repurchase of our ordinary shares pursuant to our share repurchase program are subject to among other things our financial position and results of operations 

available cash and cash flow capital and regulatory requirements market and economic conditions our ordinary share price and other factors any reduction or discontinuance by us of the payment of quarterly cash dividends or the repurchase of our ordinary shares pursuant to our share repurchase program could cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline significantly moreover in the event our payment of quarterly cash dividends or repurchases of our ordinary shares are reduced or discontinued our failure to resume such activities at historical levels could result in a persistent lower market valuation of our ordinary shares 

significant fluctuations in the market price of our ordinary shares could result in securities class action claims against us 

significant price and value fluctuations have occurred with respect to the publicly traded securities of technology companies the price of our ordinary shares is likely to be volatile in the future in the past following periods of decline in the market price of a companys securities class action lawsuits have often been pursued against that company if similar litigation were pursued against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources which could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

our ability to use our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards might be limited 

the use of a portion of our us net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards is subject to annual limitations pursuant to us tax law section 382 of the us internal revenue code generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards that might be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone significant changes in ownership as a result future changes in ownership could put further limitations on the availability of our net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards 

failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the sale and manufacturing of products in certain states and countries may subject us and our suppliers to state federal and international laws and regulations governing protection of the environment including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites restrictions on the presence of certain substances in electronic products and the responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling we endeavor to ensure that we and our suppliers comply with all applicable environmental laws and regulations however compliance may increase our operating costs and otherwise impact future financial results if additional or more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future we could incur additional operating costs and capital expenditures if we fail to comply with applicable environmental laws regulations initiatives or standards of conduct our customers may refuse to purchase our products and we could be subject to fines penalties and possible prohibition of sales of our products into one or more states or countries liability to our customers and damage to our reputation which could result in a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations 

conflict minerals regulations may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products 

in august 2012 the sec adopted new rules establishing additional disclosure and reporting requirements regarding the use of specified minerals or conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured these new rules will require us to determine disclose and report whether or not such conflict minerals originate from the democratic republic of the congo or an adjoining country the most recent report was filed on may 29 2015 these new rules could affect our ability to source certain materials used in our products at 

competitive prices and could impact the availability of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products including gold tantalum tin and tungsten as there may be only a limited number of suppliers of conflict free minerals we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary conflict free minerals in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices our customers including our oem customers may require that our products be free of conflict minerals and our revenues and margins may be harmed if we are unable to procure conflict free minerals at a reasonable price or at all or are unable to pass through any increased costs associated with meeting these demands additionally we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of all minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement we may also face challenges with government regulators and our customers and suppliers if we are unable to sufficiently verify that the metals used in our products are conflict free we expect that there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements such as costs related to determining the source of certain minerals used in our products as well as costs related to possible changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification and disclosure requirements

our data storage services provide online backup data protection and recovery solutions for small to mediumsized businesses 

business overview 

our industry is characterized by several trends and factors that have a material impact on our strategic planning financial condition and results of operations 

demand for electronic data storage 

the continued advancement of the cloud the proliferation of a variety of mobile devices globally development of the internet of things increasingly pervasive use of video surveillance evolution of 

consumer electronic devices and enterprise use of big data analytics are driving the growth of digital content factors contributing to this growth include 

• creation sharing and consumption of mediarich digital content such as highresolution photos high definition video and digital music through smart phones tablets digital cameras personal video cameras dvrs gaming consoles or other digital devices • creation aggregation and distribution of digital content through services and other offerings such as facebook® instagram® itunes® linkedin® netflix® pandora® google® and youtube® • new surveillance systems which feature higher resolution digital cameras and thus require larger data storage capacities • creation and collection of data through the evolution of the internet of things ecosystem big data analytics and new technology trends such as selfdriving cars and drones • build out of large numbers of cloud data centers by cloud service providers and private companies transitioning onsite data centers into the cloud • protection of increased digital content through redundant storage on backup devices and externally provided storage services as a result of these factors the nature and volume of content being created requires greater storage which is more efficiently and economically facilitated by higher capacity storage devices in order to store manage distribute analyze and backup such content we expect this to support the growth in demand for electronic data storage solutions in developed and emerging economies well into the future 

the amount of data created as well as where and how data is stored continues to evolve with the proliferation of mobile devices the growth of cloud computing and the evolving internet of things in addition the economics of storage infrastructure are also evolving with the utilization of public and private hyperscale storage and opensource solutions reducing the total cost of ownership of storage while increasing the speed and efficiency with which customers can leverage massive computing and storage devices accordingly we expect these trends will continue to create significant demand for electronic data storage solutions going forward 

demand trends for disk drives 

we believe that continued growth in digital content requires increasingly higher storage capacity in order to store aggregate host distribute analyze manage backup and use such content we also believe that as architectures evolve to serve the growing commercial and consumer user base throughout the world the manner which hard drives are delivered to market and utilized by our customers will evolve as well 

we believe that in the foreseeable future the traditional enterprise client compute markets that require high capacity storage solutions and the data intensive client noncompute markets will continue to be best served by hard disk drives due to the industrys ability to deliver the most cost effective reliable and energy efficient mass storage devices furthermore the increased use of client noncompute devices that both consume mediarich digital content streamed from the cloud and create rich digital content that is stored in the cloud increases the demand for high capacity hard disk drives in enterprise nearline applications 

industry supply balance 

from time to time the hdd industry has experienced periods of imbalance between supply and demand to the extent that the disk drive industry builds or maintains capacity based on expectations of 

demand that do not materialize price erosion may become more pronounced conversely during periods where demand exceeds supply price erosion is generally muted 

price erosion 

historically our industry has been characterized by price declines for disk drive products with comparable capacity performance and feature sets likeforlike products price declines for likeforlike products price erosion have been more pronounced during periods of 

• economic contraction in which competitors may use discounted pricing to attempt to maintain or gain market share • few new product introductions when competitors have comparable or alternative product offerings and • industry supply exceeding demand disk drive manufacturers typically attempt to offset price erosion with an improved mix of disk drive products characterized by higher capacity better performance and additional feature sets andor product cost reductions 

we believe the hdd industry experienced benign price erosion in fiscal years 2013 2014 and moderate price erosion in fiscal year 2015 

product life cycles and changing technology success in our industry has been dependent to a large extent on the ability to balance the introduction and transition of new products with timetovolume performance capacity and quality metrics at a competitive price level of service and support that our customers expect generally the drive manufacturer that introduces a new product first benefits from improved product mix favorable profit margins and less pricing pressure until comparable products are introduced changing technology also necessitates ongoing investments in research and development which may be difficult to recover due to rapid product life cycles and economic declines further there is a continued need to successfully execute product transitions and new product introductions as factors such as quality reliability and manufacturing yields continue to be of significant competitive importance 

seasonality 

the disk drive industry traditionally experiences seasonal variability in demand with higher levels of demand in the second half of the calendar year this seasonality is driven by consumer spending in the backtoschool season from late summer to fall and the traditional holiday shopping season from fall to winter in fiscal years 2013 and 2014 our industry experienced muted seasonal patterns as supply and demand were relatively in balance however we believe fiscal year 2015 reflected a seasonal pattern consistent with historical patterns 

fiscal year 2015 summary 

during the fiscal year 2015 we shipped 212 million units totaling 228 exabytes generating revenue of 137 billion and gross margins of 28 of revenue our operating cash flow was 26 billion which included 773 million received from western digital as partial payment of the final award plus accrued interest in our arbitration case against western digital and a 225 million payment related to the final audit assessment received from the jiangsu province state tax bureau of the peoples republic of china for tax and interest associated with changes to our tax filings for the calendar years 2007 through 2013 we issued 500 million of 575 senior notes due 2034 and 700 million of 4875 senior notes due 2027 during the december 2014 and june 2015 quarters respectively we repurchased approximately 19 million of our ordinary shares during the year for approximately 11 billion paid 09 billion for the early repurchase and redemption of debt paid dividends during the year of 07 billion and completed our 

acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of lsi corporations lsi accelerated solutions division and flash components division collectively the flash business from avago technologies limited for 450 million in cash 

results of operations 

we list in the tables below summarized information from our consolidated statements of operations by dollars and as a percentage of revenue 



  



the following table summarizes information regarding average drive selling prices asps excluding storage systems drive volume shipments exabytes shipped and revenues by channel and geography 



fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 

revenue 



revenue in fiscal year 2015 remained flat from fiscal year 2014 as a result of revenue contributed from our acquisitions of xyratex and lsis flash business and a favorable product mix partially offset by a 4 decrease in units shipped and moderate price erosion 

cost of revenue and gross margin 



for fiscal year 2015 gross margin as a percentage of revenue remained flat from the prior fiscal year as a result of improved product mix and cost savings due to increased operational efficiencies offset by moderate price erosion 

operating expenses 



product development expense product development expenses for fiscal year 2015 increased from fiscal year 2014 mostly due to an increase in headcount related costs of 111 million attributed to the consolidation of xyratex and lsis flash business as well as a 53week fiscal year in 2015 compared to 52 weeks in 2014 

marketing and administrative expense marketing and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2015 increased from fiscal year 2014 primarily due to an increase in headcount related costs of 50 million attributed to the consolidation of xyratex and lsis flash business nonrecurring legal cost reimbursement received in fiscal year 2014 of 24 million as well as a 53week fiscal year in 2015 compared to 52 weeks in 2014 

amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles for fiscal year 2015 increased by 31 million as compared to fiscal year 2014 as a result of the acquisitions of lsis flash business and xyratex 

restructuring and other net restructuring and other net for fiscal year 2015 increased by 8 million as compared to fiscal year 2014 primarily due to a restructuring charge recorded during the march 2015 quarter to reduce work force as a result of our ongoing focus on cost efficiencies in all areas of our business 

gain on arbitration award net gain on arbitration award net for fiscal year 2015 increased from fiscal year 2014 due to final award received in the amount of 630 million less litigation and other related costs of 10 million in the companys case against western digital for the misappropriation of the companys trade secrets 

other income expense net 



other income expense net for fiscal year 2015 decreased by 132 million as compared to fiscal year 2014 primarily due to the partial payment of 143 million for interest accrued on the final arbitration award amount in our case against western digital and a decrease in losses from early redemption and repurchase of debt of 15 million partially offset by a 12 million increase in interest expense 

income taxes 



we recorded an income tax provision of 228 million for fiscal year 2015 compared to an income tax benefit of 14 million for fiscal year 2014 our fiscal year 2015 income tax provision included approximately 193 million of net income tax expense due to the final audit assessment received from the jiangsu province state tax bureau of the peoples republic of china china assessment for calendar years 2007 through 2013 our fiscal year 2014 benefit from income taxes included 58 million of income tax benefits related to the reversal of a portion of the valuation allowances recorded in prior periods and a net decrease in tax reserves related to audit settlements offset by tax reserves on nonus tax positions taken in prior fiscal years 

our irish tax resident parent holding company owns various us and nonus subsidiaries that operate in multiple nonirish income tax jurisdictions our worldwide operating income is either subject to varying rates of income tax or is exempt from income tax due to tax holiday programs we operate under in malaysia singapore and thailand these tax holidays are scheduled to expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2022 

our income tax provision recorded for fiscal year 2015 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying the irish statutory rate of 25 to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i tax benefits related to nonus earnings generated in jurisdictions that are subject to tax holidays or tax incentive programs and are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of ireland ii tax expense associated with the china assessment recorded during the december 2014 quarter and iii an increase in valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets the acquisition of lsis flash business did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate our income tax benefit recorded for fiscal year 2014 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying the irish statutory rate of 25 to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i tax benefits related to nonus earnings generated in jurisdictions that are subject to tax holidays or tax incentive programs and are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of ireland and ii a decrease in valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets the acquisition of xyratex did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2014 fiscal year 2014 included a valuation allowance release associated with postacquisition restructuring 

based on our nonus ownership structure and subject to i potential future increases in our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and ii a future change in our intention to indefinitely reinvest earnings from our subsidiaries outside of ireland we anticipate that our effective tax rate in future periods will generally be less than the irish statutory rate 

at july 3 2015 our deferred tax asset valuation allowance was approximately 929 million 

at july 3 2015 we had net deferred tax assets of 612 million the realization of these deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on our ability to generate sufficient us taxable income in future periods although realization is not assured we believe that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable however may increase or decrease in subsequent periods when we reevaluate the underlying basis for our estimates of future us and certain nonus taxable income 

as of july 3 2015 approximately 422 million and 90 million of our total us net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards respectively are subject to an aggregate annual limitation of 46 million pursuant to us tax law 

as of july 3 2015 and june 27 2014 we had approximately 83 million and 115 million respectively of unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties the unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would impact the effective tax rate are 83 million and 115 million as of july 3 2015 and june 27 2014 respectively subject to certain future valuation allowance offsets 

it is our policy to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations during fiscal year 2015 we recognized a net income tax expense for interest and penalties of 26 million 8 million during fiscal year 2014 and 2 million during fiscal year 2013 as of july 3 2015 we had 20 million of accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits compared to 27 million in fiscal year 2014 

during the fiscal year ended july 3 2015 our unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties decreased by approximately 32 million primarily due to i reductions associated with audit settlements of 45 million ii increases in current year unrecognized tax benefits of 9 million iii net increases in prior years unrecognized tax benefits of 8 million iv reductions associated with the expiration of certain statutes of limitation of 3 million v net reductions from other activity including nonus exchange gains of 1 million 

during the 12 months beginning july 4 2015 we expect that our unrecognized tax benefits could be reduced by approximately 11 million as a result of the expiration of certain statutes of limitation 

we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions globally and are required to file us federal us state and nonus income tax returns in june 2014 we received the revenue agents report and notices of proposed adjustments for our us federal income tax returns for fiscal years 2008 2009 and 2010 we are currently contesting certain of these proposed adjustments through the irs appeals office we believe that the resolution of these disputed issues will not have a material impact on our financial statements as discussed above on december 31 2014 we received a final audit assessment from the jiangsu province state tax bureau of the peoples republic of china as a result of the assessment we made payments of 225 million related to tax and interest associated with changes to our tax filings in china for calendar years 2007 through 2013 in connection with resolving our tax audit with the chinese tax authorities we obtained an advance pricing agreement apa from the jiangsu province state tax bureau during the third quarter the apa covers the periods through 2018 and provides the company a predictable future tax expense that provides stability to our business model 

we are no longer subject to tax examination of us federal income tax returns for years prior to fiscal year 2008 with respect to us state and nonus income tax returns we are generally no longer subject to tax examination for years ending prior to fiscal year 2005 

fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 

revenue 



revenue in fiscal year 2014 decreased approximately 4 or 06 billion from fiscal year 2013 as a result of a 3 decrease in units shipped and a 2 decrease in the asp due to price erosion partially offset by a more favorable product mix 

gross margin 



for fiscal year 2014 gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased to 28 from 27 in the prior fiscal year as a result of improved product mix and cost savings due to increases in operational efficiencies offset by modest price erosion 

operating expenses 



product development expense product development expenses for fiscal year 2014 increased from fiscal year 2013 due to increased investments in hdd and alternative storage technologies of approximately 35 million and headcount related costs of approximately 36 million net of a decrease in variable performance based compensation expenses of 26 million in addition the consolidation of xyratex acquired on march 31 2014 contributed approximately 23 million to product development expense 

marketing and administrative expense marketing and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2014 increased from fiscal year 2013 due to a 40 million increase in headcount related expenses due to annual focal increases and increased investments in certain strategic initiatives as well as enhancement of core businesses of 25 million in addition the consolidation of xyratex contributed approximately 15 million to marketing and administrative expense 

amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles for fiscal year 2014 increased from fiscal year 2013 due to the commencement of amortization of certain inprocess research and development assets acquired from samsungs hdd business in december of 2011 and lacie in august of 2012 

restructuring and other net restructuring and other net for fiscal years 2014 increased from fiscal year 2013 primarily due to a restructuring charge recorded during the december 2013 quarter associated with a reduction in work force 

other expense net 



other income expense net for fiscal year 2014 decreased by 40 million from fiscal year 2013 due to a 60 million decrease in losses from the early redemption and repurchase of debt and a decrease of 18 million in interest expense due to a reduction in the average interest rate on our outstanding debt these decreases were partially offset by insurance proceeds of 25 million received during fiscal year 2013 for equipment damaged during the severe flooding in thailand in october of 2011 and 17 million lower gains on sales of our available for sale securities and strategic investments 

income taxes 



we recorded an income tax benefit of 14 million for fiscal year 2014 compared to an income tax benefit of 7 million for fiscal year 2013 our fiscal year 2014 benefit from income taxes included 58 million of income tax benefits related to the reversal of a portion of the valuation allowances recorded in prior periods and a net decrease in tax reserves related to audit settlements offset by tax reserves on nonus tax positions taken in prior fiscal years our fiscal year 2013 benefit for income taxes included 52 million of income tax benefit from the reversal of a portion of the us valuation allowance recorded in prior periods 

our income tax benefit recorded for fiscal year 2014 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying the irish statutory rate of 25 to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i tax benefits related to nonus earnings generated in jurisdictions that are subject to tax holidays or tax incentive programs and are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of ireland and ii a decrease in valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets the acquisition of xyratex did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate fiscal year 2014 included a valuation allowance release associated with postacquisitions restructuring our income tax benefit recorded for fiscal year 2013 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying the irish statutory rate of 25 to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i tax benefits related to nonus earnings generated in jurisdictions that are subject to tax holidays or tax incentive programs and are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of ireland and ii a decrease in valuation allowance for certain us deferred tax assets the acquisition of a majority interest in the outstanding shares of lacie did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2013 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following sections discuss our principal liquidity requirements as well as our sources and uses of cash and our liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase our shortterm investments consist primarily of money market funds certificates of deposits and other interestbearing bank deposits the principal objectives of our investment policy are the preservation of principal and maintenance of liquidity we believe our cash equivalents and shortterm investments are liquid and accessible we operate in some countries that have restrictive regulations over the movement of cash andor foreign exchange across their borders however these restrictions have not impeded our ability to conduct our business nor do we expect them to in the next 12 months we are not aware of any downgrades losses or other significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or shortterm investments and we do not believe the fair value of our shortterm investments has significantly changed from the values reported as of july 3 2015 

cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and restricted cash and investments 



our cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and restricted cash and investments decreased from june 27 2014 as a result of net cash outflow for repurchases of our ordinary shares early redemption and repayments of longterm debt dividends paid to our shareholders capital expenditures the acquisition of lsis flash business and a 225 million payment related to the final audit assessment received from the jiangsu province state tax bureau of the peoples republic of china these cash outflows were partially offset by our cash provided by operating activities which included an arbitration award partial payment of 773 million from western digital and the aggregate proceeds of 12 billion from the aggregated issuance of our 575 senior notes due 2034 and 4875 senior notes due 2027 as discussed below the following table summarizes results from the statement of cash flows for the periods indicated 



cash provided by operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year2015 was approximately 26 billion and includes the effects of net income adjusted for noncash items including depreciation amortization and stockbased compensation net income includes 

• a partial payment of 773 million for the arbitration award and related accrued interest received from western digital and • a 225 million payment related to the final audit assessment received from the jiangsu province state tax bureau of the peoples republic of china for tax and interest associated with changes to our tax filings for the calendar years 2007 through 2013 cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2014 was approximately 26 billion and includes the effects of net income adjusted for noncash items including depreciation amortization stockbased compensation and 

• a decrease of 217 million in vendor nontrade receivables primarily related to a change in the contractual relationship with some of our contract manufacturers which reduced the volume of components we sold to them 53 

• a decrease of 190 million in accounts payable due to a change in the contractual relationship with some of our contract manufacturers which resulted in a reduction in direct materials purchased and subsequently sold to our contract manufacturers and • a decrease of 104 million in restricted cash and investments primarily due to the restricted cash and investments held in a rabbi trust being replaced with a standby letter of credit cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2013 was approximately 30 billion and includes the effects of net income adjusted for noncash items including depreciation amortization stockbased compensation and 

• a decrease of 661 million in accounts receivable net primarily due to a decrease in revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 compared to the prior year period • a decrease of 538 million in accounts payable primarily due to a reduction in direct materials purchases due to a decrease in build volume in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 compared to the prior year period • a decrease of 272 million in vendor nontrade receivables primarily due to a decrease in build volumes in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 compared to the prior year period • a decrease of 170 million in accrued expenses income taxes and warranty primarily due to decreases in costs related to sales activities resulting from lower sales volumes and • a decrease of 102 million in inventory due to lower volumes in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 compared to the prior year period cash used in investing activities 

in fiscal year 2015 we used 13 billion for net cash investing activities which was primarily due to payments for property equipment and leasehold improvements of approximately 747 million and the acquisition of lsis flash business for 450 million 

in fiscal year 2014 we used 03 billion for net cash investing activities which was primarily due to payments for property equipment and leasehold improvements of approximately 559 million and the acquisition of xyratex for 285 million partially offset by 508 million of proceeds from sales of shortterm investments 

in fiscal year 2013 we used 08 billion for net cash investing activities which was primarily due to payments for property equipment and leasehold improvements 

cash used in financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities of 15 billion for fiscal year 2015 was primarily attributable to the following activities 

• 11 billion paid to repurchase 19 million of our ordinary shares • 10 billion for the repurchase and redemption of long term debt • 07 billion in dividends paid to our shareholders partially offset by • proceeds of 12 billion from aggregate cash generated from the issuance of our 575 senior notes due 2034 and 4875 senior notes due 2027 net cash used in financing activities of 13 billion for fiscal year 2014 was primarily attributable to the following activities 

• 19 billion paid to repurchase 41 million of our ordinary shares 54 

• 07 billion for the repurchase and redemption of long term debt • 06 billion in dividends paid to our shareholders partially offset by • proceeds of 18 billion from aggregate cash generated from the issuance of our 375 senior notes due in 2018 and 475 senior notes due in 2025 net cash used in financing activities of 22 billion for fiscal year 2013 was attributable to the following activities 

• 17 billion paid to repurchase 54 million of our ordinary shares • 12 billion for the repurchase and redemption of long term debt • 05 billion in dividends paid to our shareholders partially offset by • proceeds from the issuance of 1 billion of our 475 notes due 2023 and • proceeds of 03 billion from the issuance of ordinary shares under employee stock plans liquidity sources 

our primary sources of liquidity as of july 3 2015 consisted of 1 approximately 25 billion in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments 2 cash we expect to generate from operations and 3 a 700 million senior revolving credit facility 

as of july 3 2015 no borrowings have been drawn under the revolving credit facility or had been utilized for letters of credit issued under this credit facility the line of credit is available for borrowings subject to compliance with financial covenants and other customary conditions to borrowing 

the credit agreement that governs our revolving credit facility as amended contains certain covenants that we must satisfy in order to remain in compliance with the credit agreement as amended the agreement includes three financial covenants 1 minimum cash cash equivalents and marketable securities 2 a fixed charge coverage ratio and 3 a net leverage ratio as of july 3 2015 we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our revolving credit facility and debt agreements 

as of july 3 2015 cash and cash equivalents held by nonirish subsidiaries was 25 billion this amount is potentially subject to taxation in ireland upon repatriation by means of a dividend into our irish parent however it is our intent to indefinitely reinvest earnings of nonirish subsidiaries outside of ireland and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate such earnings by means of a taxable irish dividend should funds be needed in the irish parent company and should we be unable to fund parent company activities through means other than a taxable irish dividend we would be required to accrue and pay irish taxes on such dividend 

we believe that our sources of cash will be sufficient to fund our operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months 

cash requirements and commitments 

our liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital research and development and capital expenditure needs to fund scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness and to fund our dividend our ability to fund these requirements will depend on our future cash flows which are determined by future operating performance and therefore subject to prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and financial business and other factors some of which are beyond our control 

on july 21 2015 our board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of 054 per share which will be payable on august 25 2015 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on august 11 2015 

as of july 3 2015 we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our debt agreements based on our current outlook we expect to be in compliance with the covenants of our debt agreements over the next 12 months 

the carrying value of our longterm debt as of july 3 2015 and june 27 2014 was 42 billion and 39 billion respectively the table below presents the principal amounts of our outstanding longterm debt 



from time to time we may repurchase any of our outstanding ordinary shares through private open market tender offers broker assisted purchases or other means during fiscal year 2015 we repurchased approximately 19 million of our ordinary shares see item 5 market for registrants common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securitiesrepurchases of our equity securities as of july 3 2015 29 billion remained available for repurchase under our existing repurchase authorization limit all repurchases are effected as redemptions in accordance with the companys articles of association 

for fiscal year 2016 we expect capital expenditures to be at or below our longterm targeted range of 6 to 8 of revenue we require substantial amounts of cash to fund scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness future capital expenditures and any increased working capital requirements we will continue to evaluate and manage the retirement and replacement of existing debt and associated obligations including evaluating the issuance of new debt securities exchanging existing debt securities for other debt securities and retiring debt pursuant to privately negotiated transactions open market purchases tender offers or other means or otherwise in addition we may selectively pursue strategic alliances acquisitions and investments which may require additional capital 

contractual obligations and commitments 

our contractual cash obligations and commitments as of july 3 2015 have been summarized in the table below 



1 includes total future minimum rent expense under noncancelable leases for both occupied and vacated facilities rent expense is shown net of sublease income 2 purchase obligations are defined as contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services which are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms 3 consists of funding requirements related to strategic commitments 

as of july 3 2015 we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits and an accrual for the payment of related interest totaling 33 million none of which is expected to be settled within one year outside of one year we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlement with a taxing authority will occur 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of july 3 2015 we did not have any material offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of regulation sk 

critical accounting policies 

the methods estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements the sec has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are highly uncertain at the time of estimation based on this definition our most critical policies include establishment of sales program accruals establishment of warranty accruals accounting for income taxes and the accounting for goodwill and other longlived assets below we discuss these policies further as well as the estimates and judgments involved we also have other accounting policies and accounting estimates relating to uncollectible customer accounts valuation of inventory valuation of sharebased payments and restructuring we believe that these other accounting policies and accounting estimates either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective or it is less likely that they would have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period 

establishment of sales program accruals we establish certain distributor and oem sales programs aimed at increasing customer demand for oem sales rebates are typically based on an oem customers volume of purchases or other agreed upon rebate programs for the distribution channel these programs typically involve rebates related to a distributors level of sales order size advertising or point of sale activity and price protection adjustments we provide for these obligations at the time that revenue is recorded based on estimated requirements we estimate these contrarevenue rebates and adjustments based on various factors including price reductions during the period reported estimated future price erosion customer orders distributor sellthrough and inventory levels program participation customer claim submittals and sales returns our estimates reflect contractual arrangements but also our judgment relating to variables such as customer claim rates and attainment of program goals and inventory and sellthrough levels reported by our distribution customers currently our distributors inventories are within the historical range 

while we believe we have sufficient experience and knowledge of the market and customer buying patterns to reasonably estimate such rebates and adjustments actual market conditions or customer behavior could differ from our expectations as a result actual payments under these programs which may spread over several months after the related sale may vary from the amount accrued accordingly revenues and margins in the period in which the adjustment occurs may be affected 

significant actual variations in any of the factors upon which we base our contrarevenue estimates could have a material effect on our operating results in fiscal year 2015 sales programs were approximately 10 of gross revenue for fiscal years 2014 and 2013 total sales programs ranged from 7 to 10 of gross revenues adjustments to revenues due to under or over accruals for sales programs related to revenues reported in prior quarterly periods averaged 04 of quarterly gross revenue for fiscal year 2013 through 2014 and were approximately 02 of gross revenue in fiscal year 2015 any future shifts in the industry supplydemand balance as well as other factors may result in a more competitive pricing environment and may cause sales programs as a percentage of gross revenue to increase from the current or historical levels if such rebates and incentives trend upwards revenues and margins will be reduced 

establishment of warranty accruals we estimate probable product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized we generally warrant our products for a period of 1 to 5 years our warranty provision considers estimated product failure rates and trends including the timing of product returns during the warranty periods and estimated repair or replacement costs related to product quality issues if any we also exercise judgment in estimating our ability to sell certain repaired products should actual experience in any future period differ significantly from our estimates our future results of operations could be materially affected our judgment is subject to a greater degree of subjectivity with respect to newly introduced products because of limited experience with those products upon which to base our warranty estimates 

the actual results with regard to warranty expenditures could have an adverse or favorable effect on our results of operations if the actual rate of unit failure the cost to repair a unit or the actual cost required to satisfy customer claims differs from those estimates we used in determining the warranty accrual since we typically outsource our warranty repairs our repair cost is subject to periodic negotiations with vendors and may vary from our estimates we also exercise judgment in estimating our ability to sell certain repaired products to the extent such sales fall below our forecast warranty cost will be adversely impacted 

we review our warranty accrual quarterly for products shipped in prior periods and which are still under warranty any changes in the estimates underlying the accrual may result in adjustments that impact the current period gross margins and income in fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 net changes in estimates of prior warranty accruals as a percentage of revenue were immaterial our total warranty cost was 11 13 and 16 of revenue during fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively while warranty cost related 

to new shipments exclusive of the impact of reestimates of preexisting liabilities were 11 13 and 13 respectively for the same periods changes in anticipated failure rates of specific products and significant changes in repair or replacement costs have historically been the major reasons for significant changes in prior estimates any future changes in failure rates of certain products as well as changes in repair costs or the cost of replacement parts may result in increased or decreased warranty accruals 

accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes pursuant to accounting standards codification asc topic 740 asc 740 income taxes in applying asc 740 we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits recognition of income and deductions and calculation of specific tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions the calculation of tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the internal revenue service or other tax jurisdictions if estimates of these tax liabilities are greater or less than actual results an additional tax benefit or provision will result the deferred tax assets we record each period depend primarily on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states and certain nonus jurisdictions each period we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and if necessary we adjust the valuation allowance so that net deferred tax assets are recorded only to the extent we conclude it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized if our outlook for future taxable income changes significantly our assessment of the need for a valuation allowance may also change 

assessing goodwill and other longlived assets for impairment we account for goodwill in accordance with asc topic 350 intangibles—goodwill and other as permitted by asc 350 we perform a qualitative assessment in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist to determine if any events or circumstances exist such as an adverse change in business climate or a decline in the overall industry that would indicate that it would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount based on the qualitative assessment if it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then the company is not required to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test if it is determined in the qualitative assessment that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not below its carrying amount including goodwill then we perform a quantitative twostep impairment test the first step identifying a potential impairment compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value the second step would need to be conducted the second step measuring the impairment loss compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill any excess of the reporting unit goodwill carrying value over its implied fair value is recognized as an impairment loss 

in accordance with asc 360054 impairment or disposal of longlived assets we test other longlived assets including property equipment and leasehold improvements and other intangible assets subject to amortization for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of those assets may not be recoverable we assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable we will estimate the fair value of the asset group and compare it to its carrying value the excess of the carrying value over the fair value is allocated pro rata to derive the adjusted carrying value of each asset in the asset group the adjusted carrying value of each asset in the asset group is not reduced below its fair value

we have exposure to market risks due to the volatility of interest rates foreign currency exchange rates equity and bond markets a portion of these risks are hedged but fluctuations could impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows additionally we have exposure to downgrades in the credit ratings of our counterparties as well as exposure related to our credit rating changes 

interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio as of july 3 2015 the company had no material availableforsale securities that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for a period greater than 12 months the company determined no material availableforsale securities were otherthantemporarily impaired as of july 3 2015 we currently do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 

we have fixed rate debt obligations we enter into debt obligations for general corporate purposes including capital expenditures and working capital needs 

the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio and debt obligations as of july 3 2015 

fiscal years ended 



foreign currency exchange risk we may enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposure related to certain foreign currency commitments and anticipated foreign currency denominated expenditures our policy prohibits us from entering into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 

we also hedge a portion of our foreign currency denominated balance sheet positions with foreign currency forward exchange contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings will be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates the changes in fair value of these hedges are recognized in earnings in the same period as the gains and losses from the remeasurement of the assets and liabilities these foreign currency forward exchange contracts are not designated as hedging instruments under asc 815 derivatives and hedging  all these foreign currency forward contracts mature within 12 months 

we evaluate hedging effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively and record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in cost of revenue on the consolidated statements of operations we did not have any material net gains losses recognized in cost of revenue for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness or discontinued cash flow hedges during the fiscal years 2015 and 2014 

the table below provides information as of july 3 2015 about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts the table is provided in us dollar equivalent amounts and presents the notional amounts at the contract exchange rates and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates 



1 equivalent to the unrealized net gain loss on existing contracts 

other market risks we have exposure to counterparty credit downgrades in the form of credit risk related to our foreign currency forward exchange contracts and our fixed income portfolio we monitor and limit our credit exposure for our foreign currency forward exchange contracts by performing ongoing credit evaluations we also manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with any one counterparty and we maintain limits on maximum tenor of contracts based on the credit rating of the financial institution additionally the investment portfolio is diversified and structured to minimize credit risk as of july 3 2015 we had no material credit exposure related to our foreign currency forward exchange contracts changes in our corporate issuer credit ratings have minimal impact on our financial results but downgrades may negatively impact our future transaction costs and our ability to execute transactions with various counterparties 

we are subject to equity market risks due to changes in the fair value of the notional investments selected by our employees as part of our seagate deferred compensation plan the sdcp in fiscal year 2014 the company entered into a total return swap trs in order to manage the equity market risks associated with the sdcp liabilities the company pays a floating rate based on libor plus an interest rate spread on the notional amount of the trs the trs is designed to substantially offset changes in the sdcp liability due to changes in the value of the investment options made by employees

industry overview 

electronic data storage industry 

the electronic data storage industry is comprised of companies that manufacture components or subcomponents designed for electronic data storage devices and companies that provide storage solutions software and services for enterprise cloud big data and computing platforms 

markets 

the principal markets served by the electronic data storage industry are 

enterprise storage we define enterprise storage as those solutions which are designed for mission critical and nearline applications 

mission critical applications are defined as those that are vital to the operation of largescale enterprise work loads requiring high performance and high reliability storage solutions we expect the market for mission critical enterprise storage solutions to continue to be driven by enterprises utilizing dedicated storage area networks in an effort to reduce network complexity and increase energy savings we believe that this will continue to drive demand for more energy efficient smaller form factor solutions these solutions are comprised principally of high performance enterprise class disk drives with sophisticated firmware and communications technologies 

nearline applications are defined as those which require high capacity and energy efficient storage solutions we expect such applications which include storage for cloud computing content delivery and backup services will continue to grow and drive demand for solutions designed with these attributes with the increased requirements for storage driven by the creation and consumption of mediarich digital 

content we expect the increased petabyte demand will require further buildout of datacenters by cloud service providers and other enterprises which utilize high capacity nearline devices 

client compute we define client compute applications as solutions designed for desktop and mobile compute applications we believe that the demand resulting from growing economies of certain countries and the continued proliferation of digital content will continue to drive demand for the client compute market as the storage of digital content in the cloud becomes more prominent some client compute applications require less builtin storage and therefore alternative storage solutions are becoming more prevalent within the client compute market 

client noncompute we define client noncompute applications as solutions designed for consumer electronic devices and disk drives used for external storage and networkattached storage nas disk drives designed for consumer electronic devices are primarily used in applications such as dvrs and surveillance systems that require a higher capacity low costpergigabyte storage solution disk drives for external and nas devices are designed for purposes such as personal data backup and portable external storage and to augment storage capacity in the consumers current desktop notebook tablet or dvr disk drive capacities client noncompute applications also include devices designed to display digital media in the home theater we believe the proliferation and personal creation of mediarich digital content will continue to create increasing consumer demand for higher capacity storage solutions 

participants in the electronic data storage industry include 

major subcomponent manufacturers companies that manufacture components or subcomponents used in electronic data storage devices or solutions include companies that supply spindle motors heads and media application specific integrated circuits asics and glass substrates 

hardware storage solutions manufacturers companies that transform components into storage products include disk drive manufacturers and semiconductor storage manufacturers which include integrating flash memory into storage products such as ssds 

system integrators companies that bundle and package storage solutions into client compute client noncompute or enterprise applications as well as enterprise storage solutions distributors that integrate storage hardware and software into enduser applications are also included in this category 

storage services companies that provide services and solutions related to the backup archiving recovery and discovery of electronic data 

demand for electronic data storage 

the continued advancement of cloud mobile and open source computing are driving the growth of digital content factors contributing to this growth are the increased 

• creation and sharing of all types of mediarich digital content such as highresolution photos high definition video and movies and music by consumers and large amounts of electronic data by enterprises • aggregation and distribution of digital content through services and other offerings such as amazon facebook gopro instagram itunes linkedin netflix pandora and youtube • consumption of digital content through smart phones tablets dvrs and gaming consoles and • protection of digital content through storage on backup devices and externally provided storage services as a result of these factors the nature and amount of content being created requires increasingly higher capacity storage in order to store manage distribute utilize and backup such content this in turn has resulted in the rapid growth in demand for electronic data storage solutions which we believe will continue to grow in developed countries as well as in emerging economies 

the amounts of data created as well as where and how data is stored continues to evolve with the proliferation of mobile devices the growth of cloud computing and the evolving internet of things in addition the economics of storage infrastructure is also evolving with the utilization of public and private hyperscale storage and opensource solutions reducing the total cost of ownership of storage while increasing the speed and efficiency with which customers can leverage massive computing and storage power accordingly we expect these trends will continue to create significant demand for electronic data storage solutions 

demand trends for disk drives 

we believe that continued growth in digital content requires increasingly higher storage capacity in order to store aggregate host distribute manage backup and use such content we also believe that as architectures evolve to serve the growing commercial and consumer user base throughout the world the manner which hard drives are delivered to market and utilized by our customers will evolve as well 

we believe that in the foreseeable future the traditional enterprise and client compute markets that require high capacity storage solutions as well as the data intensive client noncompute markets will continue to be best served by hard disk drives due to the industrys ability to deliver cost effective reliable and energy efficient mass storage devices furthermore the increased use of client noncompute devices that consume mediarich digital content streamed from the cloud increases the demand for high capacity disk drives in nearline applications 

industry supply balance 

from time to time the industry has experienced periods of imbalance between supply and demand to the extent that the disk drive industry builds capacity based on expectations of demand that do not materialize price erosion may become more pronounced conversely during periods where demand exceeds supply price erosion is generally muted 

in early october 2011 floodwaters north of bangkok thailand inundated many manufacturing industrial parks that contained a number of the factories supporting the hdd industrys supply chain the hdd industry had concentrated a large portion of its supply chain participants within these industrial parks in an effort to reduce cost and improve logistics as a result the inundation of floodwaters into these industrial parks had caused the closure or suspension of production by a number of participants within the hdd supply chain 

during the supply chain disruption in fiscal year 2012 we believe demand exceeded supply due to the impact from the flooding in thailand resulting in an increase in the average selling price asp 

the industrys ability to manufacture and ship drives had substantially recovered as of the end of fiscal year 2012 in fiscal years 2013 and 2014 we believe the hdd industrys capacity to manufacture hdds exceeded demand however following the impact of the flooding in thailand and further industry consolidation in fiscal year 2012 the hdd industry has maintained improved pricing discipline resulting in benign price erosion in fiscal years 2013 and 2014 

our business 

disk drive technology 

the design and manufacturing of disk drives depends on highly advanced technology and manufacturing techniques and therefore requires high levels of research and development spending and capital equipment investments manufacturing our disk drives is a complex process that begins with the production of individual components and ends with a fully assembled disk drive we design fabricate and assemble a number of the most important components found in our disk drives including readwrite heads and recording media our design and manufacturing operations are based on technology platforms that are used to produce various disk drive products that serve multiple data storage applications and markets 

our core technology platforms are focused around the areal density of media and readwrite head technologies using an integrated platform design and manufacturing leverage approach allows us to deliver a portfolio of disk drive products to service a wide range of electronic data storage applications and a wide range of industries 

disk drives that we manufacture are commonly differentiated by the following key characteristics 

• storage capacity commonly expressed in gigabytes gb or terabytes tb which is the amount of data that can be stored on the disk drive • spindle rotation speed commonly expressed in revolutions per minute rpm which has an effect on speed of access to data • interface transfer rate commonly expressed in megabytes per second which is the rate at which data moves between the disk drive and the computer controller • average seek time commonly expressed in milliseconds which is the time needed to position the heads over a selected track on the disk surface • data transfer rate commonly expressed in megabytes per second which is the rate at which data is transferred to and from the disk drive • inputoutput operations per second iops commonly expressed in megabytes per second which is the maximum number of reads and writes to a storage location • product quality and reliability commonly expressed in annualized return rates and • energy efficiency commonly measured by the power output necessary to operate the disk drive areal density is a measure of storage capacity per square inch on the recording surface of a disk the storage capacity of a disk drive is determined by the number of disks it contains as well as the areal density capability of these disks we have been pursuing and will continue to pursue a number of technologies to increase areal densities across the entire range of our products for expanding disk drive capacities and reducing the number of disks and heads per drive to further reduce product costs

vertically integrated hard drive manufacturers design and produce their own readwrite heads and recording media which are critical technologies for disk drives this integrated approach enables manufacturers to lower costs and to improve the functionality of components so that they work together efficiently 

we believe that because of our vertical design and manufacturing strategy we are well suited to meet the challenges posed by the close interdependence of components for disk drives our manufacturing efficiency and flexibility are critical elements of our integrated business strategy we continuously seek to improve our manufacturing efficiency and cost by 

• employing manufacturing automation to enhance our efficiency • improving product quality and reliability and reducing costs • integrating our supply chain with suppliers and customers to enhance our demand visibility and reduce our working capital requirements • coordinating between our manufacturing group and our research and development organization to rapidly achieve volume manufacturing and • leveraging the facilities we operate and the personnel we employ a vertically integrated model however tends to have less flexibility when demand moderates as it exposes us to higher unit costs as capacity utilization is not optimized 

due to the significant challenges posed by the need to continually innovate and improve manufacturing efficiency and the continued demands on capital and research and development investments required to do so the disk drive industry has undergone significant consolidation as disk drive manufacturers and component manufacturers merged with other companies or exited the industry 

components and raw materials 

disk drives incorporate certain components including a head disk assembly and a printed circuit board mounted to the head disk assembly which are sealed inside a rigid base and top cover containing the recording components in a contamination controlled environment we maintain a highly integrated approach to our business by designing and manufacturing a significant portion of the components we view as critical to our products such as recording heads and media 

readwrite heads the function of the readwrite head is to scan across the disk as it spins magnetically recording or reading information the tolerances of recording heads are extremely demanding and require stateoftheart equipment and processes our readwrite heads are manufactured with thinfilm and photolithographic processes similar to those used to produce semiconductor integrated circuits though challenges in magnetic film properties and topographical structures are unique to the disk drive industry we perform all primary stages of design and manufacture of readwrite heads at our facilities we use a combination of internally manufactured and externally sourced readwrite heads the mix of which varies based on product mix technology and our internal capacity levels 

media information is written to the media or disk as it rotates at very high speeds past the readwrite head the media is made from nonmagnetic material usually aluminum alloy or glass and is coated with a thin layer of magnetic material we use a combination of internally manufactured and externally sourced finished media and aluminum substrates the mix of which varies based on product mix technology and our internal capacity levels we purchase all of our glass substrates from third parties which we use in the disk drives we make for mobile products 

printed circuit board assemblies the printed circuit board assemblies pcbas are comprised of standard and custom asics and ancillary electronic control chips the asics control the movement of data to and from the readwrite heads and through the internal controller and interface which communicates with the host computer the asics and control chips form electronic circuitry that delivers instructions to a head positioning mechanism called an actuator to guide the heads to the selected track of a disk where the data is recorded or retrieved disk drive manufacturers use one or more industry standard interfaces such as serial advanced technology architecture sata small computer system interface scsi serial attached scsi sas or fibre channel fc to communicate to the host systems we outsource to third parties the manufacture and assembly of the pcbas used in our disk drives we do not manufacture any asics but we participate in their proprietary design 

head disk assembly the head disk assembly consists of one or more disks attached to a spindle assembly powered by a spindle motor that rotates the disks at a high constant speed around a hub readwrite heads mounted on an arm assembly similar in concept to that of a record player fly extremely close to each disk surface and record data on and retrieve it from concentric tracks in the magnetic layers of the rotating disks the readwrite heads are mounted vertically on an eshaped assembly eblock that is actuated by a voicecoil motor to allow the heads to move from track to track the eblock and the recording media are mounted inside the head disk assembly we purchase spindle motors from outside vendors and from time to time participate in the design of the motors that go into our products we use a combination of internally manufactured and externally sourced head disk assemblies 

disk drive assembly following the completion of the head disk assembly it is mated to the pcba and the completed unit goes through extensive defect mapping and testing prior to packaging and shipment disk drive assembly and test operations occur primarily at facilities located in china and thailand we perform subassembly and component manufacturing operations at our facilities in china 

malaysia northern ireland singapore thailand and in the united states in minnesota in addition third parties manufacture and assemble components and disk drive assemblies for us in various countries worldwide 

suppliers of components and industry constraints there are a limited number of independent suppliers of components such as recording heads and media available to disk drive manufacturers vertically integrated disk drive manufacturers who manufacture their own components are less dependent on external component suppliers than less vertically integrated disk drive manufacturers 

commodity and other manufacturing costs the production of disk drives requires rare earth elements precious metals scarce alloys and industrial commodities which are subject to fluctuations in prices and the supply of which has at times been constrained in addition to increased costs of components and commodities volatility in fuel costs may also increase our costs related to commodities manufacturing and freight as a result we may increase our use of ocean shipments to help offset any increase in freight costs

customers 

we sell our products to major oems distributors and retailers 

the following table summarizes our revenue by channel and by geography 



1 revenue is attributed to countries based on the shipping location 

oem customers typically enter into master purchase agreements with us these agreements provide for pricing volume discounts order lead times product support obligations and other terms and conditions including sales programs offered to promote selected products deliveries are scheduled only after receipt of purchase orders in addition with limited leadtime customers may defer most purchase orders without significant penalty anticipated orders from many of our customers have in the past failed to materialize or oem delivery schedules have been deferred or altered as a result of changes in their business needs 

our distributors generally enter into nonexclusive agreements for the resale of our products they typically furnish us with a nonbinding indication of their nearterm requirements and product deliveries are generally scheduled accordingly the agreements and related sales programs typically provide the distributors with limited right of return and price protection rights in addition we offer sales programs to distributors on a quarterly and periodic basis to promote the sale of selected products in the sales channel 

our retail channel consists of our branded storage products sold to retailers either by us directly or by our distributors retail sales made by us or our distributors typically require greater marketing support sales incentives and price protection periods 

in fiscal years 2014 2013 and 2012 dell inc accounted for approximately 13 13 and 15 of consolidated revenue respectively while hewlettpackard company accounted for approximately 13 10 and 14 of consolidated revenue respectively see item 1a risk factorsrisks related to our businesswe may be adversely affected by the loss of or reduced delayed or canceled purchases by one or more of our larger customers 

competition 

we compete primarily with manufacturers of hard drives used in the enterprise client compute and client noncompute applications but have in the past few years also competed with manufacturers of solidstate drives the markets that we compete in are intensely competitive disk drive manufacturers not only compete for a limited number of major disk drive customers but also compete with other companies in the electronic data storage industry that provide alternative storage solutions such as flash memory and ssds some of the principal factors used by customers to differentiate among electronic data storage solutions manufacturers are storage capacity product performance product quality and reliability price per unit and price per gigabyte timetomarket and timetovolume leadership storageretrieval access times data transfer rates form factor product warranty and support capabilities supply continuity and flexibility power consumption total cost of ownership and brand while different markets and customers place varying levels of emphasis on these factors we believe that our products are competitive with respect to each of these factors in the markets that we currently address 

principal disk drive competitors following further industry consolidation during fiscal year 2012 three disk drive companies remain 

• seagate selling the seagate and samsung brands • western digital corporation operating the western digital and hitachi global storage technologies subsidiaries and • toshiba corporation other competitors we also are experiencing competition from companies that provide alternative storage technologies such as flash memory and ssds used in mobile applications such as tablets notebooks and lower capacity hand held devices in addition to ssds used in enterprise applications for rapid processing and high volume transactions additionally we may in the future face indirect competition from customers who from time to time evaluate whether to offer electronic data storage products that may compete with our products 

price erosion historically our industry has been characterized by price declines for disk drive products with comparable capacity performance and feature sets likeforlike products price declines for likeforlike products price erosion have been more pronounced during periods of 

• economic contraction in which competitors may use discounted pricing to attempt to maintain or gain market share • few new product introductions when competitors have comparable or alternative product offerings and • industry supply exceeding demand in fiscal years 2013 and 2014 we believe the hdd industrys capacity to manufacture hdds exceeded demand however following industry consolidation during fiscal year 2012 the hdd industry has maintained improved pricing discipline resulting in benign price erosion in fiscal years 2013 and 2014 

disk drive manufacturers typically attempt to offset price erosion with an improved mix of disk drive products characterized by higher capacity better performance and additional feature sets andor product cost reductions 

product life cycles and changing technology success in our industry has been dependent to a large extent on the ability to balance the introduction and transition of new products with timetovolume performance capacity and quality metrics at a competitive price level of service and support that our customers expect generally those disk drive manufacturers that are able to introduce new products first benefit from improved product mix favorable profit margins and less pricing pressure until comparable products are introduced changing technology also necessitates ongoing investments in research and development which may be difficult to recover due to rapid product life cycles and economic declines further there is a continued need to successfully execute product transitions and new product introductions as factors such as quality reliability and manufacturing yields become of increasing competitive importance 

seasonality 

the disk drive industry traditionally experiences seasonal variability in demand with higher levels of demand in the second half of the calendar year this seasonality is driven by consumer spending in the backtoschool season from late summer to fall and the traditional holiday shopping season from fall to winter 

research and development 

we are committed to developing new component technologies products and alternative storage technologies our research and development focus is designed to bring new products to market in high volume with quality attributes that our customers expect before our competitors part of our product development strategy is to leverage a design platform andor subsystem within product families to serve different market needs this platform strategy allows for more efficient resource utilization leverages best design practices reduces exposure to changes in demand and allows for achievement of lower costs through purchasing economies our advanced technology integration effort focuses disk drive and component research on recording subsystems including readwrite heads and recording media marketspecific product technology and technology focused towards new business opportunities the primary purpose of our advanced technology integration effort is to ensure timely availability of mature component technologies to our product development teams as well as allowing us to leverage and coordinate those technologies in the design centers across our products in order to take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace during fiscal years 2014 2013 and 2012 we had product development expenses of approximately 1226 million 1133 million and 1006 million respectively which represented 9 8 and 7 of our consolidated revenue respectively 

patents and licenses 

as of june 27 2014 we had 4962 us patents and 1204 patents issued in various foreign jurisdictions as well as 1236 us and 1112 foreign patent applications pending the number of patents and patent applications will vary at any given time as part of our ongoing patent portfolio management activity due to the rapid technological change that characterizes the electronic data storage industry we believe that in addition to patent protection the improvement of existing products reliance upon trade secrets protection of unpatented proprietary knowhow and development of new products are also important to our business in establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage accordingly we intend to continue our efforts to broadly protect our intellectual property including obtaining patents where available in connection with our research and development program 

we have patent licenses with a number of companies additionally as part of our normal intellectual property practices we may be engaged in negotiations with other major electronic data storage companies and component manufacturers with respect to patent licenses 

the electronic data storage industry is characterized by significant litigation relating to patent and other intellectual property rights because of rapid technological development in the electronic data storage industry some of our products have been and in the future could be alleged to infringe existing patents of third parties from time to time we receive claims that our products infringe patents of third parties although we have been able to resolve some of those claims or potential claims by obtaining licenses or rights under the patents in question without a material adverse affect on us other claims have resulted in adverse decisions or settlements in addition other claims are pending which if resolved unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations for more information on these claims see item 8 financial statements and supplementary datanote 14 legal environmental and other contingencies the costs of engaging in intellectual property litigation in the past have been and in the future may be substantial irrespective of the merits of the claim or the outcome 

backlog 

in view of industry practice whereby customers may cancel or defer orders with little or no penalty we believe backlog in the disk drive industry is of limited indicative value in estimating future performance and results 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to us and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites some of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution and these permits are subject to modification renewal and revocation by issuing authorities 

we have established environmental management systems and continually update environmental policies and standard operating procedures for our operations worldwide we believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws regulations and permits we budget for operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental laws if additional or more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future we could incur additional operating costs and capital expenditures 

some environmental laws such as the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended the superfund law and its state equivalents can impose liability for the cost of cleanup of contaminated sites upon any of the current or former site owners or operators or upon parties who sent waste to these sites regardless of whether the owner or operator owned the site at the time of the release of hazardous substances or the lawfulness of the original disposal activity we have 

been identified as a potentially responsible party at several sites at each of these sites we have an assigned portion of the financial liability based on the type and amount of hazardous substances disposed of by each party at the site and the number of financially viable parties we have fulfilled our responsibilities at some of these sites and remain involved in only a few at this time 

while our ultimate costs in connection with these sites is difficult to predict with complete accuracy based on current estimates of cleanup costs and our expected allocation of these costs we do not expect costs in connection with these sites to be material 

we may be subject to various state federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment including those restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products for example the european union eu enacted the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment which prohibits the use of certain substances including lead in certain products including disk drives put on the market after july 1 2006 similar legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions including in the united states canada mexico taiwan china japan and others the european union reach directive registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals ec 19072006 also restricts substances of very high concern svhcs in products if we or our suppliers fail to comply with the substance restrictions recycle requirements or other environmental requirements as they are enacted worldwide it could have a materially adverse effect on our business 

employees 

at june 27 2014 we employed approximately 52100 employees and temporary employees worldwide of which approximately 41400 employees were located in our asian operations we believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees at all levels we believe that our employee relations are good

 item 1a risk factors 

risks related to our business 

changes in the macroeconomic environment have negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact our results of operations 

due to the continuing uncertainty about current macroeconomic conditions affecting consumer and enterprise spending we believe our customers may postpone spending in response to tighter credit unemployment negative financial news andor declines in income or asset values which could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products continuing high unemployment rates low levels of consumer liquidity risk of default on sovereign debt and volatility in credit and equity markets have weakened consumer confidence and decreased consumer and enterprise spending in many regions around the world other factors that could influence demand include conditions in the residential real estate and mortgage markets labor and healthcare costs access to credit consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior these and other economic factors could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and on our financial condition and operating results 

our industries are highly competitive and our failure to anticipate and respond to technological and market developments could harm our ability to compete 

we operate in markets that are highly competitive and subject to rapid change and that are significantly affected by new product introductions substantial price erosion and lower prices as part of a strategy to gain or retain market share and customers should these practices continue we may need to continually reduce our prices for existing products to retain our market share which could adversely affect our results of operations 

our ability to offset the effect of price erosion through new product introductions at higher average prices is diminished to the extent competitors introduce products into particular markets ahead of our similar competing products our ability to offset the effect of price erosion is also diminished during times when supply exceeds demand for a particular product 

market share for our products can be negatively affected by our customers diversifying their sources of supply as our competitors enter the market for particular products as well as by our ability to ramp volume production of new product offerings when our competitors successfully introduce product offerings that are competitive with our recently introduced products our customers may quickly diversify their sources of supply any significant decline in our market share in any of our principal market applications would adversely affect our results of operations 

our principal sources of competition include 

• disk drive manufacturers such as western digital corporation and toshiba • companies providing storage subsystems and components to oems • electronic manufacturing services ems companies acquiring the necessary skills and intellectual property to enter the enterprise data storage marketplace • other high performance computing hpc data storage providers • collaborations between inhouse development teams of existing and potential customers and a combination of ems contract electronic manufacturing cem or emerging technology companies we also experience competition from other companies that produce alternative storage technologies like flash memory where increasing capacity decreasing cost energy efficiency and improvements in 

performance ruggedness have resulted in competition with our lower capacity smaller form factor disk drives while this competition has traditionally been in the markets for handheld consumer electronics applications these competitors have announced solid state drives ssds for tablet notebook and enterprise compute applications certain customers for both notebook and enterprise compute applications are adopting ssds as alternatives to hard drives in certain applications further adoption of these alternative storage technologies may impact the competitiveness of our product portfolio and reduce our market share and adversely affect our results of operation 

the markets for our data storage system products are also characterized by technological change driven in part by the adoption of new industry standards these standards provide mechanisms to ensure technology component interoperability can occur and may reduce our capability for differentiation or innovation and our affected products would revert to commodity status this could lower the barriers to entry to our market away from our specialist research and development skills and enable entry for the generalpurpose design skills found in some large ems and cem companies commodity markets are driven by extremely low margins and very aggressive competitive pricing if our market becomes more commoditized and we fail to deliver innovative valueadded alternatives to our customers we will have difficulty competing against the larger ems and cem companies if we are unable to compete successfully against our current and future competitors we could experience profit margin reductions or loss of market share which could significantly harm our financial condition 

our quarterly results of operations fluctuate sometimes significantly from period to period and may cause our share price to decline 

in the past our quarterly revenue and results of operations have fluctuated sometimes significantly from period to period these fluctuations which we expect to continue may be occasioned by a variety of factors including 

• current uncertainty in global economic conditions may pose a risk to the overall economy • adverse changes in the level of economic activity in the major regions in which we do business • competitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices by our competitors targeted to encourage shifting of customer demand • delays or problems in our introduction of new products particularly new disk drives with lower cost structures the inability to achieve high production yields or delays in customer qualification or initial product quality issues • changes in purchasing patterns by our distributor customers • application of new or revised industry standards • disruptions in our supply chain • increased costs or adverse changes in availability of supplies of raw materials or components • the impact of corporate restructuring activities that we have and may continue to engage in • changes in the demand for the computer systems and data storage products that contain our products due to seasonality economic conditions and other factors • changes in purchases from period to period by our primary customers • shifting trends in customer demand which when combined with overproduction of particular products particularly when the industry is served by multiple suppliers results in unfavorable supplydemand imbalances • our high proportion of fixed costs including research and development expenses 18 

• any impairments in goodwill or other longlived assets • announcements of new products services or technological innovations by us or our competitors and • adverse changes in the performance of our products as a result we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our revenue and results of operations may not be meaningful and that these comparisons may not be an accurate indicator of our future performance our results of operations in one or more future quarters may fail to meet the expectations of investment research analysts or investors which could cause an immediate and significant decline in the trading price of our ordinary shares 

if we fail to predict demand accurately for our products in any quarter we may not be able to recapture the cost of our investments 

our industry operates primarily on quarterly purchasing cycles with much of the order flow in any given quarter typically coming at the end of that quarter our manufacturing process requires us to make significant productspecific investments in inventory in each quarter for that quarters production since we typically receive the bulk of our orders late in a quarter after we have made our investments there is a risk that our orders will not be sufficient to allow us to recapture the costs of our investment before the products resulting from that investment have become obsolete we cannot assure you that we will be able to accurately predict demand in the future 

our revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent upon customer orders in that quarter we attempt to project future orders based in part on estimates from our major customers our customers estimated requirements are not always accurate and we therefore cannot predict our quarterly revenues with any degree of certainty in addition we derive a portion of our revenues in each quarter from a number of relatively large orders if one or more of our major customers decide to defer a purchase order or delays product acceptance in any given quarter this is likely to result in reduced total revenues for that quarter 

the difficulty in forecasting demand also increases the difficulty in anticipating our inventory requirements which may cause us to overproduce finished goods resulting in inventory writeoffs or underproduce finished goods adversely affecting our ability to meet customer requirements and our market share additionally the risk of inventory writeoffs could increase if we were to continue to hold higher inventory levels we cannot be certain that we will be able to recover the costs associated with increased inventory 

other factors that may negatively impact our ability to recapture the cost of investments in any given quarter include 

• the impact of variable demand and an aggressive pricing environment for disk drives • the impact of competitive product announcements and possible excess industry supply both with respect to particular disk drive products and with respect to competing alternative storage technology solutions such as ssds in tablet notebook and enterprise compute applications • our inability to reduce our fixed costs to match sales in any quarter because of our vertical manufacturing strategy which means that we make more capital investments than we would if we were not vertically integrated • dependence on our ability to successfully qualify manufacture and sell in increasing volumes on a costeffective basis and with acceptable quality our disk drive products particularly the new disk drive products with lower cost structures 19 

• uncertainty in the amount of purchases from our distributor customers who from time to time constitute a large portion of our total sales • our product mix and the related margins of the various products • accelerated reduction in the price of our disk drives due to technological advances andor an oversupply of disk drives in the market and shifting trends in demand which can create supply and demand imbalances • manufacturing delays or interruptions particularly at our manufacturing facilities in china malaysia northern ireland singapore thailand the united kingdom or the united states • limited access to components that we obtain from a single or a limited number of suppliers • the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the cost of producing our products and the effective price of our products to foreign consumers and • operational issues arising out of the increasingly automated nature of our manufacturing processes in addition the demand for client noncompute products can be even more volatile and unpredictable than the demand for client compute products in some cases our products manufactured for client noncompute applications are uniquely configured for a single customers application which creates a risk of unwanted and unsellable inventory if the anticipated volumes are not realized this potential for unpredictable volatility is increased by the possibility of competing alternative storage technologies like flash memory meeting the customers cost and capacity metrics resulting in a rapid shift in demand from our products and disk drive technology generally to alternative storage technologies unpredictable fluctuations in demand for our products or rapid shifts in demand from our products to alternative storage technologies in new client noncompute applications could materially adversely impact our future results of operations 

market acceptance of new product introductions cannot be accurately predicted and our results of operations will suffer if there is less demand for our new products than is anticipated 

the markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product introductions and technology enhancements uncertain product life cycles and changes in customer demand the success of our new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors including market acceptance our ability to manage the risks associated with product transitions the effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand and the risk that our new products will have quality problems or other defects in the early stages of introduction that were not anticipated in the design of those products accordingly we cannot accurately determine the ultimate effect that our new products will have on our results of operations 

historically our results of operations have substantially depended upon our ability to be among the firsttomaturity with new product offerings our market share and results of operations in the future may be adversely affected if we fail to 

• consistently maintain our timetomaturity performance with our new products • produce these products in sufficient volume • qualify these products with key customers on a timely basis by meeting our customers performance and quality specifications or • achieve acceptable manufacturing yields quality and costs with these products in addition the success of our new product introductions is dependent upon our ability to qualify as a primary source of supply with our oem customers in order for our products to be considered by our customers for qualification we must be among the leaders in timetomarket with those new products 

once a product is accepted any failure or delay in the qualification process or a requirement that we requalify can result in our losing sales to that customer until new products are introduced the limited number of highvolume oems magnifies the effect of missing a product qualification opportunity these risks are further magnified because we expect competitive pressures to result in declining sales eroding prices and declining gross margins on our current generation products if the delivery of our products is delayed our oem customers may use our competitors products to meet their production requirements we cannot assure that we will be among the leaders in timetomarket with new products or that we will be able to successfully qualify new products with our customers in the future 

we face the related risk that consumers and businesses may wait to make their purchases if they want to buy a new product that has been shipped or announced but not yet released if this were to occur we may be unable to sell our existing inventory of products that may be less efficient and cost effective compared to new products as a result even if we are among the firsttomaturity with a given product subsequent introductions or announcements by our competitors of new products could cause us to lose revenue and not achieve a positive return on our investment in existing products and inventory 

if we cannot successfully deliver competitive products our future results of operations may be adversely affected 

if we experience shortages or delays in the receipt of or cost increases in critical components equipment or raw materials necessary to manufacture our products we may suffer lower operating margins production delays and other material adverse effects 

the cost quality and supply of components subassemblies certain equipment and raw materials used to manufacture our products and key components like recording media and heads are critical to our success the equipment we use to manufacture our products and components is frequently custom made and comes from a few suppliers and the lead times required to obtain manufacturing equipment can be significant particularly important for our products include readwrite heads aluminum or glass substrates for recording media asics spindle motors printed circuit boards and suspension assemblies 

we rely on sole suppliers or a limited number of suppliers for some of these components that we do not manufacture including aluminum and glass substrates readwrite heads asics spindle motors printed circuit boards and suspension assemblies many of such component suppliers are geographically concentrated in particular in thailand which makes our supply chain more vulnerable to regional disruptions such as the severe flooding in thailand in october 2011 which had a material impact on the production and availability of many components if our vendors for these components are unable to meet our cost quality and supply requirements we could experience a shortage in supply or an increase in production costs which would adversely affect our results of operations 

certain rare earth elements are critical in the manufacture of our products we purchase components that contain rare earth elements from a number of countries including the peoples republic of china we cannot predict whether any nation will impose regulations quotas or embargoes upon the rare earth elements incorporated into our products that would restrict the worldwide supply of such metals or increase their cost we have experienced increased costs and production delays when we were unable to obtain the necessary equipment or sufficient quantities of some components andor have been forced to pay higher prices or make volume purchase commitments or advance deposits for some components equipment or raw materials that were in short supply in the industry in general if any major supplier were to restrict the supply available to us or increase the cost of the rare earth elements used in our products we could experience a shortage in supply or an increase in production costs which would adversely affect our results of operations 

consolidation among component manufacturers has resulted and may continue to result in some component manufacturers exiting the industry or not making sufficient investments in research to develop new components 

if there is a shortage of or delay in supplying us with critical components equipment or raw materials then 

• it is likely that our suppliers would raise their prices and if we could not pass these price increases to our customers our operating margin would decline • we might have to reengineer some products which would likely cause production and shipment delays make the reengineered products more costly and provide us with a lower rate of return on these products • we would likely have to allocate the components we receive to certain of our products and ship less of others which could reduce our revenues and could cause us to lose sales to customers who could purchase more of their required products from manufacturers that either did not experience these shortages or delays or that made different allocations and • we might be late in shipping products causing potential customers to make purchases from our competitors thus causing our revenue and operating margin to decline we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain critical components in a timely and economic manner 

we often aim to lead the market in new technology deployments and leverage unique and customized technology from single source suppliers who are early adopters in the emerging market our options in supplier selection in these cases are limited and the supplier based technology may consequently be single sourced until wider adoption of the technology occurs and any necessary licenses become available in such cases any technical issues in the suppliers technology may cause us to delay shipments of our new technology deployments and therefore harm our financial position 

changes in demand for computer systems and storage subsystems may in the future cause a decline in demand for our products 

our products are components in computers data storage systems and consumer electronics devices the demand for these products has been volatile unexpected slowdowns in demand for computer systems storage subsystems or consumer electronics devices generally cause sharp declines in demand for our products declines in consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services and on our financial condition and results of operations 

causes of declines in demand for our products in the past have included weakness in macroeconomic environments announcements or introductions of major new operating systems or semiconductor improvements or changes in consumer preferences such as the shift to mobile devices we believe these announcements and introductions have from time to time caused consumers to defer their purchases and made inventory obsolete whenever an oversupply of our products causes participants in our industry to have higher than anticipated inventory levels we experience even more intense price competition from other manufacturers than usual 

we are dependent on sales to distributors and retailers which may increase price erosion and the volatility of our sales 

a substantial portion of our sales has been to distributors of disk drive products certain of our distributors may also market other products that compete with our products product qualification programs in this distribution channel are limited which increases the number of competing products that are available to satisfy demand particularly in times of lengthening product cycles as a result purchasing decisions in this channel are based largely on price terms and product availability sales volumes through this channel are also less predictable and subject to greater volatility than sales to our oem customers in addition deterioration in business and economic conditions could exacerbate price erosion and volatility as 

distributors lower prices to compensate for lower demand and higher inventory levels our distributors ability to access credit for purposes of funding their operations may also affect purchases of our products by these customers 

if distributors reduce their purchases of our products or prices decline significantly in the distribution channel or if distributors experience financial difficulties or terminate their relationships with us our revenues and results of operations would be adversely affected 

we believe that industry demand for storage products in the longterm is increasing due to the proliferation of mediarich digital content in consumer applications and is fueling increased consumer demand for storage this has led to the expansion of our branded solutions such as external storage products to provide additional storage capacity and to secure data in case of disaster or system failure or to provide independent storage solutions for multiple users in home or small business environments consumer spending on retail sales of our branded solutions has deteriorated in some markets and may continue to do so if poor global economic conditions continue and higher levels of unemployment persist this could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services and on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition such retail sales of our branded solutions traditionally experience seasonal variability in demand with higher levels of demand in the first half of our fiscal year driven by consumer spending in the backtoschool season from late summer to fall and the traditional holiday shopping season from fall to winter additionally our ability to reach such consumers depends on our maintaining effective working relationships with major retailers and distributors failure to anticipate consumer demand for our branded solutions as well as an inability to maintain effective working relationships with retail and online distributors may adversely impact our future results of operations 

we may be adversely affected by the loss of or reduced delayed or canceled purchases by one or more of our larger customers 

some of our key customers account for a large portion of our disk drive revenue while we have longstanding relationships with many of our customers if any of our key customers were to significantly reduce their purchases from us our results of operations would be adversely affected while sales to major customers may vary from period to period a major customer that permanently discontinues or significantly reduces its relationship with us could be difficult to replace in line with industry practice new customers usually require that we pass a lengthy and rigorous qualification process at the customers cost accordingly it may be difficult or costly for us to attract new major customers additionally mergers acquisitions consolidations or other significant transactions involving our customers generally entail risks to our business if a significant transaction involving any of our key customers results in the loss of or reduction in purchases by these key customers it could have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and prospects 

we have a long and unpredictable sales cycle for enterprise data storage solutions 

our enterprise data storage solutions are technically complex and we typically supply them in high quantities to a small number of customers many of our products are also tailored to meet the specific requirements of individual customers and are often integrated by our customers into the systems and products that they sell factors that affect the length of our sales cycle include 

• the time required for testing and evaluating our products before they are deployed • the size of the deployment and • the degree of system configuration necessary to deploy our products 23 

as a result our sales cycle for enterprise data storage solutions is often in excess of one year and the length of our sales cycle is frequently unpredictable in addition the emerging and evolving nature of the market for the products that we sell may lead prospective customers to postpone their purchasing decisions we invest resources and incur costs during this cycle that may not be recovered if we do not successfully conclude sales these factors lead to difficulty in matching revenues with expenses and to increased expenditures which together may adversely impact our results of operations 

if we do not control our operating expenses we will not be able to compete effectively in our industry 

we continually seek to make our cost structure and business processes more efficient we are focused on increasing workforce flexibility and scalability and improving overall competitiveness by leveraging our global capabilities as well as external talent and skills worldwide our strategy involves to a substantial degree increasing revenue and product volume while at the same time controlling operating expenses if we do not control our operating expenses our ability to compete in the marketplace may be impaired in the past activities to reduce operating costs have included closures and transfers of facilities significant personnel reductions and efforts to increase automation the reduction of personnel and closure of facilities may adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in required volumes to meet customer demand and may result in other disruptions that affect our products and customer service our efforts to make our operations more efficient may result in restructuring and other charges 

increases in the areal density of disk drives may outpace customers demand for storage capacity 

the rate of increase in areal density or storage capacity per square inch on a disk may be greater than the increase in our customers demand for aggregate storage capacity particularly in certain market applications like client compute as a result our customers storage capacity needs may be satisfied with lower priced low capacity disk drives these factors could decrease our sales especially when combined with continued price erosion which could adversely affect our results of operations 

if we do not develop products in time to keep pace with technological changes our results of operations will be adversely affected 

our customers have demanded new generations of disk drive products as advances in computer hardware and software have created the need for improved storage products with features such as increased storage capacity improved performance and reliability and lower cost we and our competitors have developed improved products and we will need to continue to do so in the future such product development requires significant investments in research and development we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully complete the design or introduction of new products in a timely manner that we will be able to manufacture new products in sufficient volumes with acceptable manufacturing yields that we will be able to successfully market these new products or that these products will perform to specifications on a longterm basis in addition the impact of slowing areal density growth may adversely impact our ability to be successful 

when we develop new products with higher capacity and more advanced technology our results of operations may decline because the increased difficulty and complexity associated with producing these products increases the likelihood of reliability quality or operability problems if our products suffer increases in failures are of low quality or are not reliable customers may reduce their purchases of our products and our manufacturing rework and scrap costs and service and warranty costs may increase in addition a decline in the reliability of our products may make us less competitive as compared with other disk drive manufacturers or competing technologies 

due to the complexity of our products some defects may only become detectable after deployment 

our products are highly complex and are designed to operate in and form part of larger complex networks and storage systems defects in our products or in the networks and systems of which they form a part directly or indirectly have resulted in and may in the future result in 

• increased costs and product delays until complex solution level interoperability issues are resolved • costs associated with the remediation of any problems attributable to our products • loss of or delays in revenues • loss of customers • failure to achieve market acceptance and loss of market share • increased service and warranty costs and • increased insurance costs defects in our products could also result in legal actions by our customers for property damage injury or death product liability claims could exceed the level of insurance coverage that we have obtained to cover defects in our products any significant uninsured claims could significantly harm our financial condition 

our substantial leverage may place us at a competitive disadvantage in our industry 

we are leveraged and have significant debt service obligations our significant debt and debt service requirements could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities for example our high level of debt presents the following risks 

• we are required to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements • our substantial leverage increases our vulnerability to economic downturns and adverse competitive and industry conditions and could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that are less leveraged • our debt service obligations could limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry and could limit our ability to pursue other business opportunities borrow more money for operations or capital in the future and implement our business strategies • our level of debt may restrict us from raising additional financing on satisfactory terms to fund working capital capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements and • covenants in our debt instruments limit our ability to pay future dividends or make other restricted payments and investments in the event that we need to refinance all or a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures we may not be able to obtain terms as favorable as the terms of our existing debt or refinance our existing debt at all if prevailing interest rates or other factors existing at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing then the interest expense relating to the refinanced debt would increase furthermore if any rating agency changes our credit rating or outlook our debt and equity securities could be negatively affected which could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt or raise additional capital 

servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate cash may be affected by factors beyond our control 

our business may not generate cash flow in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay the principal of or interest on our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs including working capital capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements 

our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control we cannot assure you that 

• our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations • we will continue to realize the cost savings revenue growth and operating improvements that result from the execution of our longterm strategic plan or • future sources of funding will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs if we cannot fund our liquidity needs we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements we cannot assure you that any of these remedies could if necessary be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all or that they would permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations in addition if we incur additional debt the risks associated with our substantial leverage including the risk that we will be unable to service our debt or generate enough cash flow to fund our liquidity needs could intensify 

our failure to pay quarterly dividends to our shareholders could cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline significantly 

our ability to pay quarterly dividends will be subject to among other things our financial position and results of operations available cash and cash flow capital requirements and other factors any reduction or discontinuation of quarterly dividends could cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline significantly moreover in the event our payment of quarterly dividends is reduced or discontinued our failure or inability to resume paying dividends at historical levels could result in a persistently low market valuation of our ordinary shares 

if revenues fall or customer demand decreases significantly we may not meet all of our purchase commitments to certain suppliers 

from time to time we enter into longterm noncancelable purchase commitments or make large upfront investments with certain suppliers in order to secure certain components or technologies for the production of our products or to supplement our internal manufacturing capacity for certain components if our actual revenues in the future are lower than our projections or if customer demand decreases significantly below our projections we may not meet all of our purchase commitments with these suppliers as a result it is possible that our revenues will not be sufficient to recoup our upfront investments in which case we will have to shift output from our internal manufacturing facilities to these suppliers or make penaltytype payments under these contracts 

we may not be able to identify suitable strategic alliances acquisitions joint ventures or investment opportunities or successfully acquire and integrate companies that provide complementary products or technologies 

our growth strategy involves pursuing strategic alliances with making acquisitions of forming joint ventures with or making investments in other companies that are complementary to our business there is substantial competition for attractive strategic alliance acquisition joint venture and investment 

candidates accordingly we may not be able to identify suitable strategic alliances acquisition joint venture or investment candidates even if we can identify them we cannot assure you that we will be able to partner with acquire or invest in suitable candidates or integrate acquired technologies or operations successfully into our existing technologies and operations moreover our ability to finance potential strategic alliances acquisitions joint ventures or investments will be limited by our high degree of leverage the covenants contained in the instruments that govern our outstanding indebtedness and any agreements governing any other debt we may incur 

if we are successful in forming strategic alliances or acquiring forming joint ventures or making investments in other companies any of these transactions may have an adverse effect on our results of operations particularly while the operations of an acquired business are being integrated it is also likely that integration of acquired companies would lead to the loss of key employees from those companies or the loss of customers of those companies in addition the integration of any acquired companies would require substantial attention from our senior management which may limit the amount of time available to be devoted to our daytoday operations or to the execution of our strategy growth by strategic alliance acquisition joint venture or investment involves an even higher degree of risk to the extent we combine new product offerings and enter new markets in which we have limited experience and no assurance can be given that acquisitions of entities with new or alternative business models will be successfully integrated or achieve their stated objectives 

furthermore the expansion of our business involves the risk that we might not manage our growth effectively that we would incur additional debt to finance these acquisitions or investments that we may have impairment of goodwill or acquired intangible assets associated with these acquisitions and that we would incur substantial charges relating to the writeoff of inprocess research and development similar to that which we incurred in connection with several of our prior acquisitions each of these items could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we could issue additional ordinary shares in connection with future strategic alliances acquisitions joint ventures or investments issuing shares in connection with such transactions would have the effect of diluting your ownership percentage of the ordinary shares and could cause the price of our ordinary shares to decline 

we may not be successful in our efforts to grow our cloud systems and solutions business 

we have made and are continuing to make investments to expand and develop our cloud systems and solutions business including our recent acquisition of xyratex ltd xyratex a data storage technology company our cloud systems and solutions business is subject to the following risks 

• the cloud systems and solutions market may develop more slowly than we expect • we may not be able to offer compelling solutions to enterprises and consumers • our cloud systems and solutions business generally has a long and unpredictable sales cycle and growth in this business is likely to depend on relatively large customer orders which may increase the variability of our results of operations and the difficulty of matching revenues with expenses our results of operations and share price may be adversely affected if we are not successful in our efforts to grow our cloud computing business as anticipated in addition our growth in this sector may bring us into closer competition with some of our customers or potential customers which may decrease their willingness to do business with us 

we are at times subject to intellectual property legal proceedings and claims which could cause us to incur significant additional costs or prevent us from selling our products and which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject from timetotime to legal proceedings and claims including claims of alleged infringement of the patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties by us or our customers in connection with their use of our products intellectual property litigation can be expensive and timeconsuming regardless of the merits of any claim and could divert our managements attention from operating our business in addition intellectual property lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties due to the complexity of the technical issues involved which may cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations patent litigation has increased due to the current uncertainty of the law and the increasing competition and overlap of product functionality in the field some of the actions that we face from timetotime seek injunctions against the sale of our products andor substantial monetary damages which if granted or awarded could materially harm our business financial condition and operating results 

we cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of others we may not be aware of currently filed patent applications that relate to our products or technology if patents are later issued on these applications we may be liable for infringement if our products were found to infringe the intellectual property rights of others we could be required to pay substantial damages cease the manufacture use and sale of infringing products in one or more geographic locations expend significant resources to develop noninfringing technology discontinue the use of specific processes or obtain licenses to the technology infringed we might not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms or at all or be able to reengineer our products successfully to avoid infringement any of the foregoing could cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling our products which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition see item 8 financial statements and supplementary datanote 14 legal environmental and other contingencies contained in this report for a description of pending intellectual property proceedings 

we may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect our ip rights in the past we have been involved in significant and expensive disputes regarding our ip rights and those of others including claims that we may be infringing patents trademarks and other ip rights of thirdparties we expect that we will be involved in similar disputes in the future 

there can be no assurance that 

• any of our existing patents will continue to be held valid if challenged • patents will be issued for any of our pending applications • any claims allowed from existing or pending patents will have sufficient scope or strength to protect us or • our patents will be issued in the primary countries where our products are sold in order to protect our rights and potential commercial advantage in addition our competitors may be able to design their products around our patents and other proprietary rights enforcement of our rights often requires litigation if we bring a patent infringement action and are not successful our competitors would be able to use similar technology to compete with us moreover the defendant in such an action may successfully countersue us for infringement of their patents or assert a counterclaim that our patents are invalid or unenforceable 

furthermore we have significant operations and sales in foreign countries where intellectual property laws and enforcement policies are often less developed less stringent or more difficult to enforce than in the united states 

we are heavily dependent on our proprietary technology and our competitors may gain access to this technology 

we depend heavily on our proprietary technology and rely on a combination of patent copyright and trade secret laws to protect our intellectual property and expertise we also attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality agreements with our customers suppliers and employees and through other security measures despite these efforts we cannot give assurances that others will not gain access to our trade secrets or that we can fully protect our intellectual property in addition effective trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain countries in which we operate nor can we guarantee that our competitors will not independently develop comparable technologies we cannot rely on our patents to provide us with any significant competitive advantage failure to protect our proprietary rights could significantly harm our financial condition 

we could suffer a loss of revenue and increased costs exposure to significant liability reputational harm and other serious negative consequences if we sustain cyberattacks or other data security breaches that disrupt our operations or result in the dissemination of proprietary or confidential information about us or our customers or other thirdparties 

our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer equipment and the electronic data stored in our databases from damage by among other things earthquake fire natural disasters accidents power disruptions telecommunications failures acts of terrorism or war employee misconduct physical or electronic breakins cyberattacks or similar events or disruptions we manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our operations in addition our outsourcing services and cloud computing businesses routinely process store and transmit large amounts of data for our customers and vendors including sensitive and personally identifiable information as our operations become more automated and increasingly interdependent our exposure to the risks posed by these types of events will increase we have been and will likely continue to be subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes cyberattacks or other computerrelated attempts to breach the information technology systems we use for these purposes we may also be subject to information technology system failures and network disruptions due to these factors experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of thirdparties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products in addition sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from thirdparties may contain defects in design or manufacture including bugs and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system 

the costs to us to eliminate or address the foregoing security problems and security vulnerabilities before or after a cyberincident could be significant system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions we could lose existing or potential customers for outsourcing services or other information technology solutions in connection with any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products in addition breaches of our security measures and the unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers or other thirdparties could expose us our vendors and customers or other thirdparties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our 

business in addition we rely in certain limited capacities on thirdparty data management providers whose possible security problems and security vulnerabilities may have similar effects on us 

we are subject to laws rules and regulations in the us and other countries relating to the collection use and security of user data in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries and among us our subsidiaries and other parties with which we have commercial relations our ability to execute transactions and to possess and use personal information and data in conducting our business subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens that may require us to notify vendors customers or employees of a data security breach we have incurred and will continue to incur significant expenses to comply with mandatory privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law regulation industry standards or contractual obligations these laws protocols and standards continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices if we fail to comply with applicable federal state or international privacyrelated or data protection laws we may be subject to proceedings by governmental entities and incur penalties or significant legal liability 

our international operations subject us to risks related to disruptions in foreign markets currency exchange fluctuations longer payment cycles seasonality limitations imposed by a variety of legal and regulatory regimes potential adverse tax consequences increased costs our customers credit and access to capital healthrelated risks and access to personnel 

we have significant operations in foreign countries including manufacturing facilities sales personnel and customer support operations we have manufacturing facilities in china malaysia northern ireland singapore and thailand in addition to those in the united states a substantial portion of our client compute disk drive assembly occurs in our facility in china 

our international operations are subject to economic risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries including the following 

• disruptions in foreign markets disruptions in financial markets and the deterioration of the underlying economic conditions in the past in some countries including those in asia have had an impact on our sales to customers located in or whose enduser customers are located in these countries • fluctuations in currency exchange rates prices for our products are denominated predominately in us dollars even when sold to customers that are located outside the united states currency instability in asia and other geographic markets may make our products more expensive than products sold by other manufacturers that are priced in the local currency moreover many of the costs associated with our operations located outside the united states are denominated in local currencies as a consequence the increased strength of local currencies against the us dollar in countries where we have foreign operations would result in higher effective operating costs and potentially reduced earnings from time to time fluctuations in foreign exchange rates have negatively affected our operations and profitability and there can be no assurance that these fluctuations will not adversely affect our operations and profitability in the future we may attempt to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes by among other things entering into foreign currency forward exchange contracts however these contracts may not cover our full exposure and subject us to certain counterparty credit risks see item 7aquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskforeign currency exchange risk of this report for additional information about our foreign currency exchange risk • longer payment cycles our customers outside of the united states are often allowed longer time periods for payment than our us customers this increases the risk of nonpayment due to the 30 

possibility that the financial condition of particular customers may worsen during the course of the payment period 

• seasonality seasonal reductions in the business activities of our customers during the summer months particularly in europe typically result in lower earnings during those periods • legal and regulatory limitations our international operations are affected by limitations on imports tariffs duties currency exchange control regulations price controls export control laws including the trade and economic sanctions administered by the office of foreign assets control and other restraints on trade in addition the governments of many countries including china malaysia northern ireland singapore and thailand in which we have significant operating assets have exercised and continue to exercise significant influence over many aspects of their domestic economies and international trade although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate these or other applicable laws and regulations to which we may be subject violations of these laws and regulations could lead to significant penalties including restraints on our export or import privileges monetary fines criminal proceedings and regulatory or other actions that could materially adversely affect our results of operations • potential adverse tax consequences our international operations create a risk of potential adverse tax consequences including imposition of withholding or other taxes on payments by our subsidiaries in addition our taxable income in any jurisdiction is dependent upon acceptance of our operational practices and intercompany transfer pricing by local tax authorities as being on an arms length basis due to inconsistencies in application of the arms length standard among taxing authorities as well as a lack of adequate treatybased protection transfer pricing challenges by tax authorities could if successful substantially increase our income tax expense we are subject to tax audits around the world and are under audit in various jurisdictions and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax against us although we believe our tax positions are reasonable the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from our recorded income tax provisions and accruals the ultimate results of an audit could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made and could result in increases to our overall tax expense in subsequent periods • increased costs the shipping and transportation costs associated with our international operations are typically higher than those associated with our us operations resulting in decreased operating margins in some foreign countries • credit and access to capital risks our international customers could have reduced access to working capital due to higher interest rates reduced bank lending resulting from contractions in the money supply or the deterioration in the customers or its banks financial condition or the inability to access other financing • global health outbreaks the occurrence of a pandemic disease may adversely impact our operations and some of our key customers such diseases could also potentially disrupt the timeliness and reliability of the distribution network we rely on • access to personnel there is substantial competition for qualified and capable personnel in certain jurisdictions in which we operate including china which may make it difficult for us to recruit and retain qualified employees in sufficient numbers increased difficulty in recruiting or retaining sufficient and adequate personnel in our international operations may lead to increased manufacturing and employment compensation costs which could adversely affect our results of operations 31 

our international operations subject us to risks related to economic conditions political unrest and terrorism 

we have manufacturing facilities in parts of the world that periodically experience political unrest this could disrupt our ability to manufacture important components as well as cause interruptions andor delays in our ability to ship components to other locations for continued manufacture and assembly any such delays or interruptions could result in delays in our ability to fill orders and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition us and international responses to the ongoing hostilities in various regions and the risk of terrorist attacks or hostilities elsewhere in the world could exacerbate these risks 

macroeconomic developments like the debt crisis in certain countries in the european union and slowing economies in parts of asia and south america could negatively affect our business operating results or financial condition which in turn could adversely affect our stock price a general weakening of and related declining corporate confidence in the global economy or the curtailment in government or corporate spending could cause current or potential customers to reduce their information technology it budgets or be unable to fund hardware systems which could cause customers to delay decrease or cancel purchases of our products or cause customers not to pay us or to delay paying us for previously purchased products and services 

in addition political unrest in regions like the middle east terrorist attacks around the globe and the potential for other hostilities in various parts of the world potential public health crises and natural disasters continue to contribute to a climate of economic and political uncertainty that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition including our revenue growth and profitability these factors generally have the strongest effect on our sales 

the loss of key executive officers and employees could negatively impact our business prospects 

our future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued service of key members of management as well as marketing sales and product development personnel the loss of one or more of our key personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we believe our future success will also depend in large part upon our ability to attract retain and further motivate highly skilled management marketing sales and product development personnel we have experienced intense competition for personnel and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our key employees or that we will be successful in attracting assimilating and retaining personnel in the future 

significant fluctuations in the market price of our ordinary shares could result in securities class action claims against us 

significant price and value fluctuations have occurred with respect to the publicly traded securities of technology companies the price of our ordinary shares is likely to be volatile in the future in the past following periods of decline in the market price of a companys securities class action lawsuits have often been pursued against that company if similar litigation were pursued against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources which could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

deterioration in global credit and financial market conditions could negatively impact the value of our current portfolio of cash equivalents or shortterm investments and our ability to meet our financing objectives 

our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase our shortterm investments consist primarily of readily marketable debt securities with remaining maturities of more than 90 days at the time of purchase our investment policy has as its principal objectives the preservation of principal and maintenance of liquidity 

we mitigate default risk by investing in highquality investment grade securities limiting the time to maturity and by monitoring the counterparties and underlying obligors closely 

while as of the date of this filing we are not aware of any material downgrades losses or other significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or shortterm investments no assurance can be given that future deterioration in conditions of the global credit and financial markets would not negatively impact our current portfolio of cash equivalents or shortterm investments or our ability to meet our financing objectives 

failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the sale and manufacturing of products in certain states and countries may subject us and our suppliers to state federal and international laws and regulations governing protection of the environment including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites restrictions on the presence of certain substances in electronic products and the responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling we endeavor to ensure that we and our suppliers comply with all applicable environmental laws and regulations however compliance may increase our operating costs and otherwise impact future financial results if additional or more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future we could incur additional operating costs and capital expenditures if we fail to comply with applicable environmental laws regulations initiatives or standards of conduct our customers may refuse to purchase our products and we could be subject to fines penalties and possible prohibition of sales of our products into one or more states or countries liability to our customers and damage to our reputation which could result in a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations 

new conflict minerals regulations may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products 

in august 2012 the sec adopted new rules establishing additional disclosure and reporting requirements regarding the use of specified minerals or conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured these new rules will require us to determine disclose and report whether or not such conflict minerals originate from the democratic republic of the congo or an adjoining country the first such report of which was filed on may 30 2014 these new rules could affect our ability to source certain materials used in our products at competitive prices and could impact the availability of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products including gold tantalum tin and tungsten as there may be only a limited number of suppliers of conflict free minerals we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary conflict free minerals in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices our customers including our oem customers may require that our products be free of conflict minerals and our revenues and margins may be harmed if we are unable to procure conflict free minerals at a reasonable price or at all or are unable to pass through any increased costs associated with meeting these demands additionally we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of all minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement we may also face challenges with government regulators and our customers and suppliers if we are unable to sufficiently verify that the metals used in our products are conflict free we expect that there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements such as costs related to determining the source of certain minerals used in our products as well as costs related to possible changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification and disclosure requirements 

because we experience seasonality in the sales of our products our results of operations will generally be adversely impacted during the second half of our fiscal year 

sales of computer systems storage subsystems and consumer electronics tend to be seasonal and therefore we expect to continue to experience seasonality in our business as we respond to variations in our customers demand for our products in particular we anticipate that sales of our products will continue to be lower during the second half of our fiscal year in the client compute and client noncompute market applications of our disk drive business this seasonality is partially attributable to the historical trend in our results derived from our customers increased sales of desktop computers notebook computers and consumer electronics during the backtoschool and winter holiday season in the enterprise market our sales are seasonal because of the capital budgeting and purchasing cycles of our end users since our working capital needs peak during periods in which we are increasing production in anticipation of orders that have not yet been received our results of operations will fluctuate seasonally even if the forecasted demand for our products proves accurate furthermore it is difficult for us to evaluate the degree to which this seasonality may affect our business in future periods because of the rate and unpredictability of product transitions and new product introductions particularly in the client noncompute market as well as macroeconomic conditions 

the price of our ordinary shares may be volatile and could decline significantly 

the stock market in general and the market for technology stocks in particular has recently experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of companies if these market or industrybased fluctuations continue the trading price of our ordinary shares could decline significantly independent of our actual operating performance and you could lose all or a substantial part of your investment the market price of our ordinary shares could fluctuate significantly in response to several factors including among others 

• general uncertainty in stock market conditions occasioned by global economic conditions negative financial news and the continued instability of several large financial institutions • actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations • announcements of innovations new products or significant price reductions by us or our competitors including those competitors who offer alternative storage technology solutions • our failure to meet the performance estimates of investment research analysts • the timing of announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts or acquisitions • general stock market conditions • the occurrence of major catastrophic events • changes in financial estimates by investment research analysts • changes in the credit ratings of our indebtedness by rating agencies and • the sale of our ordinary shares held by certain equity investors or members of management political events war terrorism natural disasters public health issues and other circumstances could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

war terrorism geopolitical uncertainties natural disasters public health issues and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy and thus could have a strong negative effect on our business our suppliers logistics providers manufacturing vendors and customers our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes fire power shortages terrorist attacks other hostile acts labor 

disputes public health issues and other events beyond our control such events could decrease demand for our products make it difficult or impossible for us to make and deliver products to our customers or to receive components from our suppliers and create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain in the event of a natural disaster losses and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations and our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected should major public health issues including pandemics arise we could be negatively affected by stringent employee travel restrictions additional limitations in freight services governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in our operations and some of our key customers 

if we do not realize the expected benefits of our strategic alignment with samsung our business and financial condition may be materially impaired 

we may not achieve the desired benefits from our strategic alignment with samsung even if we are able to successfully integrate the business that we acquired from samsung into our business we may not be able to realize the cost savings synergies and growth that we anticipate from this transaction in the timeframe we currently expect and the costs of achieving these benefits may be higher than we currently expect because of a number of risks including but not limited to 

• the possibility that the transaction may not further our business strategy as we expected • our operating results or financial condition may be adversely impacted by liabilities that we assume in the transaction and • the risk of intellectual property disputes with respect to the acquired assets in addition the chinese ministry of commerce conditioned its approval of the samsung acquisition on our compliance with several ongoing requirements including adopting measures to keep the samsung hdd brand as a separate competitor to the seagate hdd brand expanding the samsung hdd production capacity within six months of the decision and investing at least 800 million per year for three years in rd in our combined samsung and seagate hdd businesses compliance with these obligations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practices that result in reduced revenue noncompliance could result in extending the time under which we would be compelled to operate under these conditions 

as a result of these risks the transaction may not contribute to our earnings as we expected we may not achieve expected cost synergies when expected or at all and we may not achieve the other anticipated strategic and financial benefits of this transaction 

our ability to use our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards might be limited 

at june 27 2014 the use of approximately 376 million and 90 million of our us net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards respectively is subject to an aggregate annual limitation of 46 million pursuant to us tax law to the extent these net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are available we intend to use them to reduce the corporate income tax liability associated with our operations in the us section 382 of the us internal revenue code generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards that might be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone significant changes in ownership as a result future changes in ownership such as changes in ownership resulting from future repurchases of our ordinary shares could put limitations on the availability of our net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards if certain ownership changes occur in the foreseeable future there may be an additional annual limitation on our ability to use our total us federal and state net operating loss and credit carryforwards of 29 billion 18 billion and 429 million respectively if these ownership changes were to occur we estimate a onetime charge for additional us income tax expense of approximately 400 million to 500 million may be recorded in the period such 

change occurs this additional income tax expense results from a decrease in our net us deferred tax assets recorded through a combination of the write off of deferred tax assets and associated changes to our valuation allowance we also estimate that the ensuing additional annual limitation on our ability to use tax attribute carryovers may result in increased us income tax expense associated with such change of approximately 70 million to 85 million each year

business overview 

our industry is characterized by several trends and factors that have a material impact on our strategic planning financial condition and results of operations 

industry supply balance 

from time to time the industry has experienced periods of imbalance between supply and demand to the extent that the disk drive industry builds capacity based on expectations of demand that do not materialize price erosion may become more pronounced conversely during periods where demand exceeds supply price erosion is generally muted 

in early october 2011 floodwaters north of bangkok thailand inundated many manufacturing industrial parks that contained a number of the factories supporting the hdd industrys supply chain the hdd industry had concentrated a large portion of its supply chain participants within these industrial parks in an effort to reduce cost and improve logistics as a result the inundation of floodwaters into these industrial parks had caused the closure or suspension of production by a number of participants within the hdd supply chain 

during the supply chain disruption in fiscal year 2012 we believe demand exceeded supply due to the impact from the flooding in thailand resulting in an increase in the average selling price asp 

the industrys ability to manufacture and ship drives had substantially recovered as of the end of fiscal year 2012 in fiscal years 2013 and 2014 we believe the hdd industrys capacity to manufacture hdds exceeded demand however following the impact of the flooding in thailand and further industry consolidation in fiscal year 2012 the hdd industry has maintained improved pricing discipline resulting in benign price erosion in fiscal years 2013 and 2014 

demand trends for disk drives 

we believe that continued growth in digital content requires increasingly higher storage capacity in order to store aggregate host distribute manage backup and use such content we also believe that as architectures evolve to serve the growing commercial and consumer user base throughout the world the manner which hard drives are delivered to market and utilized by our customers will evolve as well 

we believe that in the foreseeable future the traditional enterprise and client compute markets that require high capacity storage solutions as well as the data intensive client noncompute markets will continue to be best served by hard disk drives due to the industrys ability to deliver cost effective reliable and energy efficient mass storage devices furthermore the increased use of client noncompute devices that consume mediarich digital content streamed from the cloud increases the demand for high capacity disk drives in nearline applications 

price erosion historically our industry has been characterized by price declines for disk drive products with comparable capacity performance and feature sets likeforlike products 

disk drive manufacturers typically attempt to offset price erosion with an improved mix of disk drive products characterized by higher capacity better performance and additional feature sets andor product cost reductions 

seasonality 

the disk drive industry traditionally experiences seasonal variability in demand with higher levels of demand in the second half of the calendar year this seasonality is driven by consumer spending in the backtoschool season from late summer to fall and the traditional holiday shopping season from fall to winter in addition corporate demand is typically higher during the second half of the calendar year 

fiscal year 2014 summary 

during the fiscal year 2014 we shipped 220 million units totaling 202 exabytes generating revenue of 137 billion and gross margins of 28 of revenue our operating cash flow was 26 billion we issued 1 billion of 475 senior notes due 2025 and 800 million of 375 senior notes due 2018 during the june 2014 and december 2013 quarters respectively we repurchased approximately 41 million of our ordinary shares during the year for approximately 19 billion paid dividends of 06 billion paid 07 billion for the early redemption and repurchase of debt with a principal value of 07 billion additionally we acquired all of the outstanding shares of xyratex ltd xyratex a leading provider of data storage technology for approximately 04 billion during the june 2014 quarter we entered into an agreement to acquire lsis accelerated solutions division and flash components division from avago for approximately 05 billion the lsi acquisition is expected to close in the first quarter of the fiscal year 2015 

results of operations 

we list in the table below summarized information from our consolidated statements of operations by dollars and as a percentage of revenue 



  



the following table summarizes information regarding revenue volume shipments exabytes average selling prices asps and revenues by channel and geography 



fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 

revenue 



revenue in fiscal year 2014 decreased approximately 4 or 06 billion from fiscal year 2013 as a result of a 3 decrease in units shipped and a 2 decrease in the asp due to price erosion partially offset by a more favorable product mix 

gross margin 



for fiscal year 2014 gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased to 28 from 27 in the prior fiscal year as a result of improved product mix and cost savings due to increases in operational efficiencies offset by modest price erosion 

operating expenses 



product development expense product development expenses for fiscal year 2014 increased from fiscal year 2013 due to increased investments in hdd and alternative storage technologies of approximately 35 million and headcount related costs of approximately 36 million net of a decrease in variable performance based compensation expenses of 26 million in addition the consolidation of xyratex acquired on march 31 2014 contributed approximately 23 million to product development expense 

marketing and administrative expense marketing and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2014 increased from fiscal year 2013 due to a 40 million increase in headcount related expenses due to annual focal increases and increased investments in certain strategic initiatives as well as enhancement of core businesses of 25 million in addition the consolidation of xyratex contributed approximately 15 million to marketing and administrative expense 

amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles for fiscal year 2014 increased from fiscal year 2013 due to the commencement of amortization of certain inprocess research and development assets acquired from samsungs hdd business in december of 2011 and lacie in august of 2012 

restructuring and other net restructuring and other net for fiscal years 2014 increased from fiscal year 2013 primarily due to a restructuring charge recorded during the december 2013 quarter associated with a reduction in work force 

other expense net 



other expense net other expense net for fiscal year 2014 decreased by 40 million from fiscal year 2013 due to a 60 million decrease in losses from the early redemption and repurchase of debt and a decrease of 18 million in interest expense due to a reduction in the average interest rate on our outstanding debt these decreases were partially offset by insurance proceeds of 25 million received during fiscal year 2013 for equipment damaged during the severe flooding in thailand in october of 2011 and 17 million lower gains on sales of our available for sale securities and strategic investments 

income taxes 



we recorded an income tax benefit of 14 million for fiscal year 2014 compared to an income tax benefit of 7 million for fiscal year 2013 our fiscal year 2014 benefit from income taxes included 58 million of income tax benefits related to the reversal of a portion of the valuation allowances recorded in prior periods and a net decrease in tax reserves related to audit settlements offset by tax reserves on nonus tax positions taken in prior fiscal years our fiscal year 2013 benefit for income taxes included 52 million of income tax benefit from the reversal of a portion of the us valuation allowance recorded in prior periods 

our irish tax resident parent holding company owns various us and nonus subsidiaries that operate in multiple nonirish tax jurisdictions our worldwide operating income is either subject to varying rates of tax or is exempt from tax due to tax holidays or tax incentive programs we operate under in malaysia singapore and thailand these tax holidays or incentives are scheduled to expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2020 

our income tax benefit recorded for fiscal year 2014 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying the irish statutory rate of 25 to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i tax benefits related to nonus earnings generated in jurisdictions that are subject to tax holidays or tax incentive programs and are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of ireland and ii a decrease in valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets the acquisition of xyratex is not expected to have a material impact on our effective tax rate in future periods fiscal year 2014 included a valuation allowance release associated with postacquisitions restructuring our income tax benefit recorded for fiscal year 2013 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying the irish statutory rate of 25 to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i tax benefits related to nonus earnings generated in jurisdictions that are subject to tax holidays or tax incentive programs and are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of ireland and ii a decrease in valuation allowance for certain us deferred tax assets the acquisition of a majority interest in the outstanding shares of lacie did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2013 

based on our nonus ownership structure and subject to i potential future increases in our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and ii a future change in our intention to indefinitely reinvest earnings from our subsidiaries outside of ireland we anticipate that our effective tax rate in future periods will generally be less than the irish statutory rate 

at june 27 2014 our deferred tax asset valuation allowance was approximately 888 million 

at june 27 2014 we had net deferred tax assets of 615 million the realization of these deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on our ability to generate sufficient us and certain nonus taxable income in future periods although realization is not assured we believe that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable however may increase or decrease in subsequent periods when we reevaluate the underlying basis for our estimates of future us and certain nonus taxable income 

as of june 27 2014 the use of approximately 376 million and 90 million of our total us net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards respectively is subject to an aggregate annual limitation of 46 million pursuant to us tax law if certain ownership changes occur in the foreseeable future there may be an additional annual limitation on our ability to use our total us federal and state net operating loss and credit carryforwards of 29 billion 18 billion and 429 million respectively it is reasonably possible that such a change could occur if these ownership changes were to occur we estimate a onetime charge for additional us income tax expense of approximately 400 million to 500 million may be recorded in the period such change occurs this additional income tax expense results from a decrease in our net us deferred tax assets recorded through a combination of the write off of deferred tax assets and associated changes to our valuation allowance we also estimate that the ensuing additional annual limitation on our ability to use our tax attribute carryovers may result in increased us income tax expense associated with such change of approximately 70 million to 85 million each year 

as of june 27 2014 and june 28 2013 we had approximately 115 million and 157 million respectively of unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties the unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would impact the effective tax rate is 115 million and 157 million as of june 27 2014 and june 28 2013 respectively subject to certain future valuation allowance reversals 

it is our policy to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for taxes on the consolidated statements of operations during fiscal year 2014 we recognized a net tax expense for interest and penalties of 8 million as compared to a net tax expense for interest and penalties of 2 million during each fiscal year 2013 and fiscal year 2012 as of june 27 2014 we had 27 million of accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits compared to 19 million in fiscal year 2013 

during the fiscal year ended june 27 2014 our unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties decreased by approximately 42 million primarily due to i net decreases in prior years unrecognized tax benefits of 54 million ii increases in current year unrecognized tax benefits of 13 million iii decreases associated with the expiration of certain statutes of limitation of 3 million iv increases from other activity including nonus exchange gains of 2 million 

during the 12 months beginning june 28 2014 we expect that our unrecognized tax benefits could be reduced anywhere from 3 million to 50 million as a result of audit settlements and the expiration of certain statutes of limitation 

we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions globally and are required to file us federal us state and nonus income tax returns in june 2014 we received the revenue agents report and notices of proposed adjustments for our us federal income tax returns for fiscal years 2008 2009 and 2010 our china subsidiaries are under examination by the chinese tax administration for years 2004 through 2012 these examinations may result in proposed adjustments to our income taxes as filed during these periods we believe that we have adequately provided for these matters but there is a reasonable possibility that an adverse outcome of these examinations could have a material effect on our financial results in this case we would consider pursuing all possible remedies available to us including appeals judicial review and competent authority 

we are no longer subject to tax examination of us federal income tax returns for years prior to fiscal year 2008 with respect to us state and nonus income tax returns we are generally no longer subject to tax examination for years ending prior to fiscal year 2004 we believe we have provided adequately for all reasonable outcomes 

fiscal year 2013 compared to fiscal year 2012 

revenue 



revenue in fiscal year 2013 decreased approximately 4 or 06 billion from fiscal year 2012 due to a decrease in the average selling price per unit the decrease in the average selling price to 63 per unit during fiscal year 2013 as compared to 66 per unit in the prior year was primarily due to supply constraints beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year 2012 as a result of the severe flooding in thailand partially offset by a favorable product mix and slightly higher volumes in fiscal year 2013 which included a full period of samsung labeled hdd products 

gross margin 



for fiscal year 2013 gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased to 27 from 31 in the prior fiscal year as a result of higher asps during fiscal year 2012 our asps during fiscal year 2012 were increased due to the limited industry supply of hard drives as a result of the severe flooding in thailand 

operating expenses 



product development expense product development expenses for fiscal year 2013 increased from fiscal year 2012 primarily due to increased investments in hdd and alternative storage technologies of approximately 84 million and headcount related costs of approximately 41 million net of a decrease in variable performance based compensation of approximately 7 million 

marketing and administrative expense marketing and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2013 increased from fiscal year 2012 primarily due to further investments in certain strategic initiatives as well as enhancement of our core business operations this along with our annual focal increases resulted in additional headcount related costs of 64 million net of a reduction in variable performance based compensation of 7 million in addition the consolidation of lacie in fiscal year 2013 contributed approximately 32 million to marketing and administrative expense 

amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles for fiscal year 2013 increased as a result of the acquisition of samsungs hdd business in december of 2011 and lacie in august of 2012 

restructuring and other net restructuring and other net for fiscal years 2013 and 2012 was not material and primarily related to previously announced restructuring plans 

other expense net 



other expense net for fiscal year 2013 compared to fiscal year 2012 increased due to a loss of 141 million on the early redemption and repurchase of debt these losses were partially offset by gains recorded for sales of our available for sale securities and strategic investments of 61 million insurance proceeds of 25 million for equipment damaged during the severe flooding in thailand in october of 2011 

and a decrease in interest expense of 27 million due to a reduction in our average interest rate and total debt levels 

income taxes 



we recorded an income tax benefit of 7 million for fiscal year 2013 compared to an income tax provision of 20 million for fiscal year 2012 our fiscal year 2013 benefit for income taxes included 52 million of income tax benefit from the reversal of a portion of the us valuation allowance recorded in prior periods our fiscal year 2012 provision for income taxes included 35 million of income tax benefit from the reversal of a portion of the us valuation allowance recorded in prior periods 

our income tax benefit recorded for fiscal year 2013 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying the irish statutory rate of 25 to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i tax benefits related to nonus earnings generated in jurisdictions that are subject to tax holidays or tax incentive programs and are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of ireland and ii a decrease in valuation allowance for certain us deferred tax assets the acquisition of a majority interest in the outstanding shares of lacie did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2013 our income tax provision recorded for fiscal year 2012 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying the irish statutory rate of 25 to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i tax benefits related to nonus earnings generated in jurisdictions that are subject to tax holidays or tax incentive programs and are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of ireland and ii a decrease in valuation allowance for certain us deferred tax assets the acquisition of samsungs hdd business did not have a significant impact on our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2012 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following sections discuss our principal liquidity requirements as well as our sources and uses of cash and our liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase our shortterm investments consist primarily of readily marketable securities with remaining maturities of more than 90 days at the time of purchase the principal objectives of our investment policy are the preservation of principal and maintenance of liquidity we intend to maintain a highly liquid portfolio by investing only in those marketable securities that we believe have active secondary or resale markets we believe our cash equivalents and shortterm investments are liquid and accessible we operate in some countries that have restrictive regulations over the movement of cash andor foreign exchange across their borders however these restrictions have not impeded our ability to conduct our business nor do we expect them to in the next 12 months we are not aware of any downgrades losses or other significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or shortterm investments and accordingly we do not believe the fair value of our shortterm investments has significantly changed from the values reported as of june 27 2014 

cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and restricted cash and investments 



our cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and restricted cash and investments increased from june 28 2013 as a result of net cash provided by operating activities and the proceeds from the issuance of 800 million of our 375 senior notes due 2018 and 1 billion of our 475 senior notes due 2025 these cash inflows were partially offset by repurchases of our ordinary shares redemption and repurchase of certain of our longterm debt capital expenditures dividends paid to our shareholders and the acquisition of xyratex 

the following table summarizes results from the statement of cash flows for the periods indicated 



cash provided by operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2014 was approximately 26 billion and includes the effects of net income adjusted for noncash items including depreciation amortization stockbased compensation and 

• a decrease of 217 million in vendor nontrade receivables primarily related to a change in the contractual relationship with some of our contract manufacturers which reduced the volume of components we sold to them • a decrease of 190 million in accounts payable due to a change in the contractual relationship with some of our contract manufacturers which resulted in a reduction in direct materials purchased and subsequently sold to our contract manufacturers and • a decrease of 104 million in restricted cash and investments primarily due to the restricted cash and investments held in a rabbi trust being replaced with a standby letter of credit cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2013 was approximately 30 billion and includes the effects of net income adjusted for noncash items including depreciation amortization stockbased compensation and 

• a decrease of 661 million in accounts receivable net primarily due to a decrease in revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 compared to the prior year period 53 

• a decrease of 538 million in accounts payable primarily due to a reduction in direct materials purchases due to a decrease in build volume in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 compared to the prior year period • a decrease of 272 million in vendor nontrade receivables primarily due to a decrease in build volumes in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 compared to the prior year period • a decrease of 170 million in accrued expenses income taxes and warranty primarily due to decreases in costs related to sales activities resulting from lower sales volumes and • a decrease of 102 million in inventory due to lower volumes in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 compared to the prior year period cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2012 was approximately 33 billion and includes the effects of net income adjusted for noncash items including depreciation amortization stockbased compensation impairment of longlived assets and 

• an increase of 824 million in accounts receivable net due to an increase in revenues • an increase of 157 million in accounts payable due to higher direct material purchases related to an increase in volume partially offset by a change in supplier payment terms and • an increase of 145 million in accrued employee compensation reflecting an increase in variable performancebased compensation cash used in investing activities 

in fiscal year 2014 we used 03 billion for net cash investing activities which was primarily due to payments for property equipment and leasehold improvements of approximately 559 million and the acquisition of xyratex of 285 million partially offset by 508 million of proceeds from sales of shortterm investments 

in fiscal year 2013 we used 08 billion for net cash investing activities which was primarily due to payments for property equipment and leasehold improvements 

in fiscal year 2012 we used 11 billion for net cash investing activities which was primarily due to payments for property equipment and leasehold improvements of approximately 06 billion and net payments for the acquisition of samsungs hdd business of 06 billion 

cash used in financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities of 13 billion for fiscal year 2014 was primarily attributable to 19 billion paid to repurchase 41 million of our ordinary shares 07 billion for the repurchase and redemption of long term debt and 06 billion in dividends paid to our shareholders this use of cash was partially offset by 18 billion from aggregate cash generated from the issuance of our 375 senior notes due in 2018 and 475 senior notes due in 2025 

net cash used in financing activities of 22 billion for fiscal year 2013 was attributable to 17 billion paid to repurchase 54 million of our ordinary shares 12 billion for the repurchase and redemption of long term debt and 05 billion in dividends paid to our shareholders this use of cash was partially offset by the proceeds from the issuance of 1 billion of our 475 notes due 2023 and 03 billion in proceeds from the issuance of ordinary shares under employee stock plans 

net cash provided by financing activities of 31 billion for fiscal year 2012 was attributable to 24 billion paid to repurchase 101 million of our ordinary shares 07 billion in long term debt repayments and 04 billion in dividends paid to our shareholders this use of cash was partially offset by 03 billion in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchases 

liquidity sources 

our primary sources of liquidity as of june 27 2014 consisted of 1 approximately 27 billion in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments 2 cash we expect to generate from operations and 3 a 500 million revolving credit facility with an interest rate of libor plus a variable margin to be determined based on the corporate credit rating of the company at the time a loan is made 

as of june 27 2014 no borrowings have been drawn under the revolving credit facility or had been utilized for letters of credit the line of credit is available for borrowings subject to compliance with financial covenants and other customary conditions to borrowing 

the credit agreement that governs our revolving credit facility as amended contains certain covenants that we must satisfy in order to remain in compliance with the credit agreement as amended the agreement includes three financial covenants 1 minimum cash cash equivalents and marketable securities 2 a fixed charge coverage ratio and 3 a net leverage ratio as of june 27 2014 we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our revolving credit facility and debt agreements 

as of june 27 2014 cash and cash equivalents held by nonirish subsidiaries was 26 billion this amount is potentially subject to taxation in ireland upon repatriation by means of a dividend into our irish parent however it is our intent to indefinitely reinvest earnings of nonirish subsidiaries outside of ireland and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate such earnings by means of a taxable irish dividend should funds be needed in the irish parent company and should we be unable to fund parent company activities through means other than a taxable irish dividend we would be required to accrue and pay irish taxes on such dividend 

we believe that our sources of cash will be sufficient to fund our operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months 

cash requirements and commitments 

our liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital research and development and capital expenditure needs to fund scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness and to fund our dividend our ability to fund these requirements will depend on our future cash flows which are determined by future operating performance and therefore subject to prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and financial business and other factors some of which are beyond our control 

on july 17 2014 our board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of 043 per share which will be payable on august 22 2014 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on august 8 2014 

as of june 27 2014 we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our debt agreements based on our current outlook we expect to be in compliance with the covenants of our debt agreements over the next 12 months 

the carrying value of our longterm debt as of june 27 2014 and june 28 2013 was 39 billion and 28 billion respectively the table below presents the principal amounts of our outstanding longterm debt 



during fiscal year 2014 we repurchased approximately 41 million of our ordinary shares see item 5 market for registrants common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securitiesrepurchases of our equity securities 

on may 29 2014 we entered into a definitive asset purchase agreement under which we will acquire the assets of lsis accelerated solutions division asd and flash components division fcd from avago for 450 million in cash the transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal year 2015 subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions and the receipt of certain regulatory approvals including those required by the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act 

for fiscal year 2015 we expect capital expenditures to be at or below our longterm targeted range of 68 of revenue we require substantial amounts of cash to fund scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness future capital expenditures and any increased working capital requirements we will continue to evaluate and manage the retirement and replacement of existing debt and associated obligations including evaluating the issuance of new debt securities exchanging existing debt securities for other debt securities and retiring debt pursuant to privately negotiated transactions open market purchases or otherwise in addition we may selectively pursue strategic alliances acquisitions and investments which may require additional capital 

contractual obligations and commitments 

our contractual cash obligations and commitments as of june 27 2014 have been summarized in the table below 



1 includes total future minimum rent expense under noncancelable leases for both occupied and vacated facilities rent expense is shown net of sublease income 2 purchase obligations are defined as contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services which are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms 

as of june 27 2014 we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits and an accrual for the payment of related interest totaling 90 million none of which is expected to be settled within one year outside of one year we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlement with a taxing authority will occur 

on may 29 2014 we entered into a definitive asset purchase agreement under which we will acquire the assets of lsis accelerated solutions division asd and flash components division fcd from avago for 450 million in cash the transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal year 2015 subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions and the receipt of certain regulatory approvals including those required by the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of june 27 2014 we did not have any material offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of regulation sk 

critical accounting policies 

the methods estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements the sec has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are highly uncertain at the time of estimation based on this definition our most critical policies include establishment of sales program accruals establishment of warranty accruals accounting for income taxes and the accounting for goodwill and other longlived assets below we discuss these policies further as well as the estimates and judgments involved we also have other accounting policies and accounting estimates relating to uncollectible customer accounts valuation of inventory valuation of sharebased payments and restructuring we believe that these other accounting policies and accounting estimates either do not generally require us to make 

estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective or it is less likely that they would have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period 

establishment of sales program accruals we establish certain distributor and oem sales programs aimed at increasing customer demand for oem sales rebates are typically based on an oem customers volume of purchases or other agreed upon rebate programs for the distribution channel these programs typically involve rebates related to a distributors level of sales order size advertising or point of sale activity and price protection adjustments we provide for these obligations at the time that revenue is recorded based on estimated requirements we estimate these contrarevenue rebates and adjustments based on various factors including price reductions during the period reported estimated future price erosion customer orders distributor sellthrough and inventory levels program participation customer claim submittals and sales returns our estimates reflect contractual arrangements but also our judgment relating to variables such as customer claim rates and attainment of program goals and inventory and sellthrough levels reported by our distribution customers currently our distributors inventories are within the historical range 

while we believe we have sufficient experience and knowledge of the market and customer buying patterns to reasonably estimate such rebates and adjustments actual market conditions or customer behavior could differ from our expectations as a result actual payments under these programs which may spread over several months after the related sale may vary from the amount accrued accordingly revenues and margins in the period in which the adjustment occurs may be affected 

significant actual variations in any of the factors upon which we base our contrarevenue estimates could have a material effect on our operating results in fiscal year 2014 sales programs were approximately 8 of gross revenue for fiscal years 2013 and 2012 total sales programs ranged from 2 to 10 of gross revenues adjustments to revenues due to under or over accruals for sales programs related to revenues reported in prior quarterly periods averaged 03 of quarterly gross revenue for fiscal years 2012 through 2013 and were approximately 05 of gross revenue in fiscal year 2014 any future shifts in the industry supplydemand balance as well as other factors may result in a more competitive pricing environment and may cause sales programs as a percentage of gross revenue to increase from the current or historical levels if such rebates and incentives trend upwards revenues and margins will be reduced 

establishment of warranty accruals we estimate probable product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized we generally warrant our products for a period of 1 to 5 years our warranty provision considers estimated product failure rates and trends including the timing of product returns during the warranty periods and estimated repair or replacement costs related to product quality issues if any we also exercise judgment in estimating our ability to sell certain repaired disk drives should actual experience in any future period differ significantly from our estimates our future results of operations could be materially affected our judgment is subject to a greater degree of subjectivity with respect to newly introduced products because of limited experience with those products upon which to base our warranty estimates 

the actual results with regard to warranty expenditures could have an adverse or favorable effect on our results of operations if the actual rate of unit failure the cost to repair a unit or the actual cost required to satisfy customer claims differs from those estimates we used in determining the warranty accrual since we typically outsource our warranty repairs our repair cost is subject to periodic negotiations with vendors and may vary from our estimates we also exercise judgment in estimating our ability to sell certain repaired disk drives to the extent such sales fall below our forecast warranty cost will be adversely impacted 

we review our warranty accrual quarterly for products shipped in prior periods and which are still under warranty any changes in the estimates underlying the accrual may result in adjustments that impact the current period gross margins and income in fiscal years 2014 2013 and 2012 net changes in estimates of prior warranty accruals as a percentage of revenue were immaterial our total warranty cost was 13 

16 and 15 of revenue during fiscal years 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively while warranty cost related to new shipments exclusive of the impact of reestimates of preexisting liabilities were 13 13 and 11 respectively for the same periods changes in anticipated failure rates of specific products and significant changes in repair or replacement costs have historically been the major reasons for significant changes in prior estimates any future changes in failure rates of certain products as well as changes in repair costs or the cost of replacement parts may result in increased or decreased warranty accruals 

accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes pursuant to accounting standards codification asc topic 740 asc 740 income taxes in applying asc 740 we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits recognition of income and deductions and calculation of specific tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions the calculation of tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the internal revenue service or other tax jurisdictions if estimates of these tax liabilities are greater or less than actual results an additional tax benefit or provision will result the deferred tax assets we record each period depend primarily on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states and certain nonus jurisdictions each period we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and if necessary we adjust the valuation allowance so that net deferred tax assets are recorded only to the extent we conclude it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized if our outlook for future taxable income changes significantly our assessment of the need for a valuation allowance may also change 

assessing goodwill and other longlived assets for impairment we account for goodwill in accordance with asc topic 350 intangibles—goodwill and other as permitted by asc 350 we perform a qualitative assessment at the end of each reporting period to determine if any events or circumstances exist such as an adverse change in business climate or a decline in the overall industry that would indicate that it would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount based on the qualitative assessment if it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then the company is not required to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test 

in accordance with asc 360054 impairment or disposal of longlived assets we test other longlived assets including property equipment and leasehold improvements and other intangible assets subject to amortization for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of those assets may not be recoverable we assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using the same approaches indicated above for asc 360 step two and compare it to its carrying value the excess of the carrying value over the fair value is allocated pro rata to derive the adjusted carrying value of each asset in the asset group the adjusted carrying value of each asset in the asset group is not reduced below its fair value

interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio as of june 27 2014 the company had no availableforsale securities that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for a period greater than 12 months the company determined no availableforsale securities were otherthantemporarily impaired as of june 27 2014 we currently do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio

fiscal years ended 



foreign currency exchange risk we may enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposure related to certain foreign currency commitments and anticipated foreign currency denominated expenditures our policy prohibits us from entering into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes during fiscal years 2014 and 2013 we did not enter into any hedges of net investments in foreign operations 

we also hedge a portion of our foreign currency denominated balance sheet positions with foreign currency forward exchange contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings will be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates the changes in fair value of these hedges are recognized in earnings in the same period as the gains and losses from the remeasurement of the assets and liabilities these foreign currency forward exchange contracts are not designated as hedging instruments under asc 815 derivatives and hedging all these forward contracts mature within 12 months 

we evaluate hedging effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively and record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in costs of revenue on the consolidated statements of operations we did not 

have any material net gains losses recognized in costs of revenue for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness or discontinued cash flow hedges during fiscal years 2014 and 2013

1 equivalent to the unrealized net gain loss on existing contracts 

other market risks we have exposure to counterparty credit downgrades in the form of credit risk related to our foreign currency forward exchange contracts and our fixed income portfolio we monitor and limit our credit exposure for our foreign currency forward exchange contracts by performing ongoing credit evaluations we also manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with any one counterparty and we maintain limits on maximum tenor of contracts based on the credit rating of the financial institutions additionally the investment portfolio is diversified and structured to minimize credit risk as of june 27 2014 we had no material credit exposure related to our foreign currency forward exchange contracts changes in our corporate issuer credit ratings have minimal impact on our financial results but downgrades may negatively impact our future transaction costs and our ability to execute transactions with various counterparties 

we are subject to equity market risks due to changes in the fair value of the notional investments selected by our employees as part of our seagate deferred compensation plan the sdcp during the fiscal year 2014 the company entered into a total return swap trs in order to manage the equity market risks associated with the sdcp liabilities the company pays a floating rate based on libor plus an interest rate spread on the notional amount of the trs the trs is designed to substantially offset changes in the sdcp liability due to changes in the value of the investment options made by employees

industry overview 

electronic data storage industry 

the electronic data storage industry is comprised of companies that manufacture components or subcomponents designed for electronic data storage devices and companies that provide storage solutions through a variety of technologies such as disk drives semiconductorbased storage technologies such as ssd storage applications and software and services for cloud growth big data and onpremise and mobility platforms 

markets 

the principal markets served by the electronic data storage industry are 

enterprise storage we define enterprise storage as those solutions which are designed for mission critical and nearline applications 

mission critical applications are defined as those that are vital to the operation of enterprises requiring high performance and high reliability solutions we expect the market for mission critical enterprise storage solutions to continue to be driven by enterprises moving network traffic to dedicated storage area networks in an effort to reduce network complexity and increase energy savings we believe that this transition will lead to an increased demand for more energy efficient smaller form factor solutions these solutions are comprised principally of high performance enterprise class disk drives with sophisticated firmware and communications technologies 

nearline applications are defined as those which require high capacity and energy efficient solutions featuring low costs per gigabyte we expect such applications which include storage for cloud computing content delivery and backup services will continue to grow and drive demand for solutions designed with these attributes with the increased consumption of media rich content streamed from the cloud we expect increased petabyte demand for high capacity nearline devices 

client compute we define client compute applications as solutions designed for desktop and mobile compute applications we believe that the demand resulting from growing economies of certain countries and the continued proliferation of digital content will continue to drive demand for the client compute market as the storage of digital content in the cloud becomes more prominent some client compute applications require less builtin storage and therefore alternative storage solutions are becoming more prevalent within the client compute market 

client noncompute we define client noncompute applications as solutions designed for consumer electronic devices and disk drives used for external storage and networkattached storage nas disk drives designed for consumer electronic devices are primarily used in applications such as dvrs and gaming consoles that require a higher capacity low costpergigabyte storage solution disk drives for external and nas devices are designed for purposes such as personal data backup and portable external storage and to augment storage capacity in the consumers current desktop notebook tablet or dvr disk drive capacities client noncompute applications also include devices designed to display digital media in the home theater we believe the proliferation and personal creation of high definition and mediarich digital content will continue to create increasing consumer demand for higher storage solutions 

participants in the electronic data storage industry include 

major subcomponent manufacturers companies that manufacture components or subcomponents used in electronic data storage devices or solutions include companies that supply spindle motors heads and media application specific integrated circuits asics and glass substrates 

hardware storage solutions manufacturers companies that transform components into storage products include disk drive manufacturers and semiconductor storage manufacturers which include integrating flash memory into storage products such as ssds 

system integrators companies that bundle and package storage solutions into client compute client noncompute or enterprise applications as well as enterprise storage solutions distributors that integrate storage hardware and software into enduser applications are also included in this category 

storage services companies that provide services and solutions related to the backup archiving recovery and discovery of electronic data 

demand for electronic data storage 

the continued advancement of cloud mobile and open source computing as well as an increase in the use and reliance on big data analytics are driving the growth of digital content factors contributing to this growth are the increased 

• creation and sharing of all types of digital content such as highresolution photos high definition video and movies and music by consumers and large amounts of electronic data by enterprises • aggregation and distribution of digital content through services and other offerings such as facebook instagram itunes linkedin netflix pandora and youtube • consumption of digital content through smart phones tablets dvrs and gaming consoles • use of machine generated data that is produced and stored in increasingly larger quantities and • protection of digital content through storage on backup devices and externally provided storage services as a result of these factors the nature and amount of content being created requires increasingly higher storage capacity in order to store manage distribute utilize and backup such content this in turn has resulted in the rapid growth in demand for electronic data storage applications and solutions which we believe will continue to grow in developed countries as well as in emerging economies 

additionally as the way electronic data is consumed continues to evolve with the proliferation of mobile devices and the growth of cloud computing we also expect shifts in the manner that electronic data is stored accordingly we expect that demand for electronic data storage in the enterprise and traditional noncompute markets will continue to grow 

demand trends for disk drives 

we believe that continued growth in digital content requires increasingly higher storage capacity in order to store aggregate host distribute manage backup and use such content we also believe that as architectures evolve to serve the growing commercial and consumer user base throughout the world the manner which hard drives are delivered to market and utilized by our customers will evolve as well 

we believe that in the foreseeable future the traditional enterprise and client compute markets that require high capacity storage solutions as well as the data intensive client noncompute markets will continue to be best served by hard disk drives due to the industrys ability to deliver cost effective reliable and energy efficient mass storage devices furthermore the increased use of client noncompute devices that consume media rich content streamed from the cloud increases the demand for high capacity disk drives in nearline applications 

industry supply balance 

from time to time the industry has experienced periods of imbalance between supply and demand to the extent that the disk drive industry builds capacity based on expectations of demand that do not materialize price erosion may become more pronounced conversely during periods where demand exceeds supply price erosion is generally muted 

our business 

disk drive technology 

the design and manufacturing of disk drives depends on highly advanced technology and manufacturing techniques and therefore requires high levels of research and development spending and capital equipment investments manufacturing our disk drives is a complex process that begins with the production of individual components and ends with a fully assembled disk drive we design fabricate and assemble a number of the most important components found in our disk drives including readwrite heads and recording media our design and manufacturing operations are based on technology platforms that are used to produce various disk drive products that serve multiple data storage applications and markets our core technology platforms are focused around the areal density of media and readwrite head technologies using an integrated platform design and manufacturing leverage approach allows us to deliver a portfolio of disk drive products to service a wide range of electronic data storage applications and a wide range of industries 

disk drives that we manufacture are commonly differentiated by the following key characteristics 

• storage capacity commonly expressed in gigabytes gb or terabytes tb which is the amount of data that can be stored on the disk drive • spindle rotation speed commonly expressed in revolutions per minute rpm which has an effect on speed of access to data • interface transfer rate commonly expressed in megabytes per second which is the rate at which data moves between the disk drive and the computer controller • average seek time commonly expressed in milliseconds which is the time needed to position the heads over a selected track on the disk surface • data transfer rate commonly expressed in megabytes per second which is the rate at which data is transferred to and from the disk drive • inputoutput operations per second iops commonly expressed in megabytes per second which is the maximum number of reads and writes to a storage location 6 

• product quality and reliability commonly expressed in annualized return rates and • energy efficiency commonly measured by the power output necessary to operate the disk drive areal density is a measure of storage capacity per square inch on the recording surface of a disk the storage capacity of a disk drive is determined by the number of disks it contains as well as the areal density capability of these disks we have been pursuing and will continue to pursue a number of technologies to increase areal densities across the entire range of our products for expanding disk drive capacities and reducing the number of disks and heads per drive to further reduce product costs 

manufacturing 

vertically integrated hard drive manufacturers design and produce their own readwrite heads and recording media which are critical technologies for disk drives this integrated approach enables manufacturers to lower costs and to improve the functionality of components so that they work together efficiently 

we believe that because of our vertical design and manufacturing strategy we are well suited to meet the challenges posed by the close interdependence of components for disk drives our manufacturing efficiency and flexibility are critical elements of our integrated business strategy we continuously seek to improve our manufacturing efficiency and cost by 

• employing manufacturing automation to enhance our efficiency • improving product quality and reliability and reducing costs • integrating our supply chain with suppliers and customers to enhance our demand visibility and reduce our working capital requirements • coordinating between our manufacturing group and our research and development organization to rapidly achieve volume manufacturing and • leveraging the facilities we operate and the personnel we employ a vertically integrated model however tends to have less flexibility when demand moderates as it exposes us to higher unit costs as capacity utilization is not optimized 

due to the significant challenges posed by the need to continually innovate and improve manufacturing efficiency and the continued demands on capital and research and development investments required to do so the disk drive industry has undergone significant consolidation as disk drive manufacturers and component manufacturers merged with other companies or exited the industry 

components and raw materials 

disk drives incorporate certain components including a head disk assembly and a printed circuit board mounted to the head disk assembly which are sealed inside a rigid base and top cover containing the recording components in a contamination controlled environment we maintain a highly integrated approach to our business by designing and manufacturing a significant portion of the components we view as critical to our products such as recording heads and media 

readwrite heads the function of the readwrite head is to scan across the disk as it spins magnetically recording or reading information the tolerances of recording heads are extremely demanding and require stateoftheart equipment and processes our readwrite heads are manufactured with thinfilm and photolithographic processes similar to those used to produce semiconductor integrated circuits though challenges in magnetic film properties and topographical structures are unique to the disk drive industry we perform all primary stages of design and manufacture of readwrite heads at our 

facilities we use a combination of internally manufactured and externally sourced readwrite heads the mix of which varies based on product mix technology and our internal capacity levels 

media information is written to the media or disk as it rotates at very high speeds past the readwrite head the media is made from nonmagnetic material usually aluminum alloy or glass and is coated with a thin layer of magnetic material we use a combination of internally manufactured and externally sourced finished media and aluminum substrates the mix of which varies based on product mix technology and our internal capacity levels we purchase all of our glass substrates from third parties which we use in the disk drives we make for mobile products 

printed circuit board assemblies the printed circuit board assemblies pcbas are comprised of standard and custom asics and ancillary electronic control chips the asics control the movement of data to and from the readwrite heads and through the internal controller and interface which communicates with the host computer the asics and control chips form electronic circuitry that delivers instructions to a head positioning mechanism called an actuator to guide the heads to the selected track of a disk where the data is recorded or retrieved disk drive manufacturers use one or more industry standard interfaces such as serial advanced technology architecture sata small computer system interface scsi serial attached scsi sas or fibre channel fc to communicate to the host systems we outsource to third parties the manufacture and assembly of the pcbas used in our disk drives we do not manufacture any asics but we participate in their proprietary design 

head disk assembly the head disk assembly consists of one or more disks attached to a spindle assembly powered by a spindle motor that rotates the disks at a high constant speed around a hub readwrite heads mounted on an arm assembly similar in concept to that of a record player fly extremely close to each disk surface and record data on and retrieve it from concentric tracks in the magnetic layers of the rotating disks the readwrite heads are mounted vertically on an eshaped assembly eblock that is actuated by a voicecoil motor to allow the heads to move from track to track the eblock and the recording media are mounted inside the head disk assembly we purchase spindle motors from outside vendors and from time to time participate in the design of the motors that go into our products we use a combination of internally manufactured and externally sourced head disk assemblies 

disk drive assembly following the completion of the head disk assembly it is mated to the pcba and the completed unit goes through extensive defect mapping and testing prior to packaging and shipment disk drive assembly and test operations occur primarily at facilities located in china and thailand we perform subassembly and component manufacturing operations at our facilities in china malaysia northern ireland singapore thailand and in the united states in minnesota in addition third parties manufacture and assemble components and disk drive assemblies for us in various countries worldwide 

suppliers of components and industry constraints there are a limited number of independent suppliers of components such as recording heads and media available to disk drive manufacturers vertically integrated disk drive manufacturers who manufacture their own components are less dependent on external component suppliers than less vertically integrated disk drive manufacturers 

commodity and other manufacturing costs the production of disk drives requires rare earth elements precious metals scarce alloys and industrial commodities which are subject to fluctuations in prices and the supply of which has at times been constrained in addition to increased costs of components and commodities volatility in fuel costs may also increase our costs related to commodities manufacturing and freight as a result we may increase our use of ocean shipments to help offset any increase in freight costs

customers 

we sell our products to major oems distributors and retailers 

the following table summarizes our revenue 1 by channel and by geography 



1 revenue is attributed to countries based on the shipping location 

oem customers typically enter into master purchase agreements with us these agreements provide for pricing volume discounts order lead times product support obligations and other terms and conditions including sales programs offered to promote selected products deliveries are scheduled only after receipt of purchase orders in addition with limited leadtime customers may defer most purchase orders without significant penalty anticipated orders from many of our customers have in the past failed to materialize or oem delivery schedules have been deferred or altered as a result of changes in their business needs 

our distributors generally enter into nonexclusive agreements for the resale of our products they typically furnish us with a nonbinding indication of their nearterm requirements and product deliveries are generally scheduled accordingly the agreements and related sales programs typically provide the distributors with limited right of return and price protection rights in addition we offer sales programs to distributors on a quarterly and periodic basis to promote the sale of selected products in the sales channel 

our retail channel consists of our branded storage products sold to retailers either by us directly or by our distributors retail sales made by us or our distributors typically require greater marketing support sales incentives and price protection periods 

in fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 dell inc accounted for approximately 13 15 and 13 of consolidated revenue respectively while hewlettpackard company accounted for approximately 10 14 and 15 of consolidated revenue respectively see item 1a risk factors—risks related to our business— dependence on key customers—we may be adversely affected by the loss of or reduced delayed or canceled purchases by one or more of our larger customers 

competition 

we compete primarily with manufacturers of hard drives used in the enterprise client compute and client noncompute applications but have in the past few years also competed with manufacturers of solidstate drives the markets that we compete in are intensely competitive disk drive manufacturers not only compete for a limited number of major disk drive customers but also compete with other companies in the electronic data storage industry that provide alternative storage solutions such as flash memory and ssds some of the principal factors used by customers to differentiate among electronic data storage solutions manufacturers are storage capacity product performance product quality and reliability price per unit and price per gigabyte timetomarket and timetovolume leadership storageretrieval access times data transfer rates form factor product warranty and support capabilities supply continuity and flexibility warranty and brand while different markets and customers place varying levels of emphasis on these factors we believe that our products are competitive with respect to each of these factors in the markets that we currently address 

principal disk drive competitors following industry consolidation during fiscal year 2012 three disk drive companies remain 

• seagate selling the seagate and samsung brands • western digital corporation operating the western digital and hitachi global storage technologies subsidiaries and • toshiba corporation other competitors we also are experiencing competition from companies that provide alternative storage technologies such as flash memory and ssds used in mobile applications such as tablets notebooks and lower capacity hand held devices in addition to ssds used in enterprise applications for rapid processing and high volume transactions additionally we may in the future face indirect competition from customers who from time to time evaluate whether to offer electronic data storage products that may compete with our products 

price erosion historically our industry has been characterized by price declines for disk drive products with comparable capacity performance and feature sets likeforlike products price declines for likeforlike products price erosion have been more pronounced during periods of 

• economic contraction in which competitors may use discounted pricing to attempt to maintain or gain market share • few new product introductions when competitors have comparable or alternative product offerings and • industry supply exceeding demand disk drive manufacturers typically attempt to offset price erosion with an improved mix of disk drive products characterized by higher capacity better performance and additional feature sets andor product cost reductions 

product life cycles and changing technology success in our industry has been dependent to a large extent on the ability to balance the introduction and transition of new products with timetovolume 

performance capacity and quality metrics at a competitive price level of service and support that our customers expect generally those disk drive manufactures that are able to introduce new products first benefit from improved product mix favorable profit margins and less pricing pressure until comparable products are introduced changing technology also necessitates ongoing investments in research and development which may be difficult to recover due to rapid product life cycles and economic declines further there is a continued need to successfully execute product transitions and new product introductions as factors such as quality reliability and manufacturing yields become of increasing competitive importance 

seasonality 

the disk drive industry traditionally experiences seasonal variability in demand with higher levels of demand in the second half of the calendar year this seasonality is driven by consumer spending in the backtoschool season from late summer to fall and the traditional holiday shopping season from fall to winter 

research and development 

we are committed to developing new component technologies products and alternative storage technologies our research and development focus is designed to bring new products to market in high volume with quality attributes that our customers expect before our competitors part of our product development strategy is to leverage a design platform andor subsystem within product families to serve different market needs this platform strategy allows for more efficient resource utilization leverages best design practices reduces exposure to changes in demand and allows for achievement of lower costs through purchasing economies our advanced technology integration effort focuses disk drive and component research on recording subsystems including readwrite heads and recording media marketspecific product technology and technology focused towards new business opportunities the primary purpose of our advanced technology integration effort is to ensure timely availability of mature component technologies to our product development teams as well as allowing us to leverage and coordinate those technologies in the design centers across our products in order to take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace during fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 we had product development expenses of approximately 1133 million 1006 million and 875 million respectively which represented 8 7 and 8 of our consolidated revenue respectively 

patents and licenses 

as of june 28 2013 we had 5570 us patents and 1965 patents issued in various foreign jurisdictions as well as 1304 us and 1259 foreign patent applications pending the number of patents and patent applications will vary at any given time as part of our ongoing patent portfolio management activity due to the rapid technological change that characterizes the electronic data storage industry we believe that in addition to patent protection the improvement of existing products reliance upon trade secrets protection of unpatented proprietary knowhow and development of new products are also important to our business in establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage accordingly we intend to continue our efforts to broadly protect our intellectual property including obtaining patents where available in connection with our research and development program 

the electronic data storage industry is characterized by significant litigation relating to patent and other intellectual property rights because of rapid technological development in the electronic data storage industry some of our products have been and in the future could be alleged to infringe existing patents of third parties from time to time we receive claims that our products infringe patents of third parties although we have been able to resolve some of those claims or potential claims by obtaining licenses or rights under the patents in question without a material adverse affect on us other claims have resulted in adverse decisions or settlements in addition other claims are pending which if resolved 

unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations for more information on these claims see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data—note 14 legal environmental and other contingencies the costs of engaging in intellectual property litigation in the past have been and in the future may be substantial irrespective of the merits of the claim or the outcome we have patent licenses with a number of companies additionally as part of our normal intellectual property practices we may be engaged in negotiations with other major electronic data storage companies and component manufacturers with respect to patent licenses 

backlog 

in view of industry practice whereby customers may cancel or defer orders with little or no penalty we believe backlog in the disk drive industry is of limited indicative value in estimating future performance and results 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to us and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites some of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution and these permits are subject to modification renewal and revocation by issuing authorities 

we have established environmental management systems and continually update environmental policies and standard operating procedures for our operations worldwide we believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws regulations and permits we budget for operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental laws if additional or more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future we could incur additional operating costs and capital expenditures 

some environmental laws such as the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended the superfund law and its state equivalents can impose liability for the cost of cleanup of contaminated sites upon any of the current or former site owners or operators or upon parties who sent waste to these sites regardless of whether the owner or operator owned the site at the time of the release of hazardous substances or the lawfulness of the original disposal activity we have been identified as a potentially responsible party at several sites at each of these sites we have an assigned portion of the financial liability based on the type and amount of hazardous substances disposed of by each party at the site and the number of financially viable parties we have fulfilled our responsibilities at some of these sites and remains involved in only a few at this time 

while our ultimate costs in connection with these sites is difficult to predict with complete accuracy based our current estimates of cleanup costs and its expected allocation of these costs we do not expect costs in connection with these sites to be material 

we may be subject to various state federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment including those restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products for example the european union eu enacted the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment which prohibits the use of certain substances including lead in certain products including disk drives put on the market after july 1 2006 similar legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions including in the united states canada mexico taiwan china japan and others the european union reach directive registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals ec 19072006 also restricts substances of very high concern svhcs in products if we or our suppliers fail to comply with the substance restrictions recycle requirements or other environmental requirements as they are enacted worldwide it could have a materially adverse effect on our business 

employees 

at june 28 2013 we employed approximately 53200 employees and temporary employees worldwide of which approximately 45000 employees were located in our asian operations we believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees at all levels we believe that our employee relations are good

 item 1a risk factors 

risks related to our business 

macroeconomic conditions—changes in the macroeconomic environment have and may continue to negatively impact our results of operations 

due to the continuing uncertainty about current macroeconomic conditions affecting consumer and enterprise spending we believe our customers may postpone spending in response to tighter credit unemployment negative financial news andor declines in income or asset values which could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products continuing high unemployment rates low levels of consumer liquidity risk of default on sovereign debt and volatility in credit and equity markets have weakened consumer confidence and decreased consumer and enterprise spending in many regions around the world other factors that could influence demand include conditions in the residential real estate and mortgage markets labor and healthcare costs access to credit consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior these and other economic factors could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and on our financial condition and operating results 

competition—our industry is highly competitive and our products have experienced and may continue to experience significant price erosion and market share variability 

the disk drive industry is intensely competitive and vendors have typically experienced substantial price erosion over the life of a product our competitors have historically offered existing products at lower prices as part of a strategy to gain or retain market share and customers should these practices continue we may need to continually reduce our prices for existing products to retain our market share which could adversely affect our results of operations 

while recent slowing areal density improvements and longer product lifecycles have necessitated that hard drive manufacturers reduce engagement in aggressive pricing tactics that have historically led to increased price erosion we believe that industry price erosion and market share may remain volatile should the industry engage in aggressive pricing actions targeted to shift customer demand 

sales to distributors that serve producers of nonbranded products in the personal storage sector may also contribute to increased price erosion these customers generally have limited product qualification programs which increases the number of competing products available to satisfy their demand as a result purchasing decisions for these customers are based largely on price and terms any increase in our average price erosion would have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

additionally a significant portion of our success in the past has been a result of increasing our market share at the expense of our competitors particularly in enterprise markets market share for our products can be negatively affected by our customers diversifying their sources of supply as our competitors enter the market for particular products as well as by our ability to ramp volume production of new product offerings when our competitors successfully introduce product offerings that are competitive with our recently introduced products our customers may quickly diversify their sources of supply any significant decline in our market share in any of our principal market applications would adversely affect our results of operations 

principal competitors—we compete with both an independent manufacturer whose primary focus is producing technologically advanced disk drives and a captive manufacturer who does not depend solely on sales of disk drives to maintain its profitability 

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience intense competition from an independent disk drive manufacturer and a captive manufacturer the term independent in this context refers to manufacturers that primarily produce disk drives as a standalone product such as western digital 

corporation and the term captive in this context refers to a manufacturer who through affiliated entities produces complete computer or other systems that contain disk drives or other electronic data storage products such as toshiba corporation 

the captive manufacturer is a formidable competitor because it has the ability to determine pricing for complete systems without regard to the margins on individual components as components other than disk drives generally contribute a greater portion of the operating margin on a complete computer system than do disk drives the captive manufacturer does not necessarily need to realize a profit on the disk drives included in a complete computer system and as a result may be willing to sell disk drives to third parties at very low margins the captive manufacturer is also a formidable competitor because it has more substantial resources than we do to the extent we are not successful competing with the captive or independent disk drive manufacturers our results of operations will be adversely affected 

in response to customer demand for highquality highvolume and lowcost disk drives manufacturers of disk drives have had to develop large and in some cases global production facilities with highly developed technological capabilities and internal controls the development of these large production facilities combined with industry consolidation can further increase the intensity of competition 

we also face indirect competition from present and potential customers who evaluate from time to time whether to manufacture their own disk drives or other electronic data storage products that may compete with our products 

we also experience competition from other companies that produce alternative storage technologies like flash memory where increasing capacity decreasing cost energy efficiency and improvements in performance ruggedness have resulted in competition with our lower capacity smaller form factor disk drives while this competition has traditionally been in the markets for handheld consumer electronics applications these competitors have announced solid state drives ssds for tablet notebook and enterprise compute applications certain customers for both notebook and enterprise compute applications are adopting ssds as alternatives to hard drives in certain applications 

volatility of quarterly results—our quarterly results of operations fluctuate sometimes significantly from period to period and may cause our share price to decline 

in the past our quarterly revenue and results of operations have fluctuated sometimes significantly from period to period these fluctuations which we expect to continue may be occasioned by a variety of factors including 

• current uncertainty in global economic conditions may pose a risk to the overall economy • adverse changes in the level of economic activity in the major regions in which we do business • competitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices by our competitors targeted to encourage shifting of customer demand • delays or problems in our introduction of new products particularly new disk drives with lower cost structures the inability to achieve high production yields or delays in customer qualification or initial product quality issues • changes in purchasing patterns by our distributor customers • increased costs or adverse changes in availability of supplies of raw materials or components • the impact of corporate restructuring activities that we have and may continue to engage in • changes in the demand for the computer systems storage subsystems and consumer electronics that contain our disk drives due to seasonality economic conditions and other factors 19 

• changes in purchases from period to period by our primary customers particularly as our competitors are able to introduce and produce in volume competing disk drive solutions or alternative storage technology solutions such as flash memory or ssds • shifting trends in customer demand which when combined with overproduction of particular products particularly when the industry is served by multiple suppliers results in unfavorable supplydemand imbalances • our high proportion of fixed costs including research and development expenses • announcements of new products services or technological innovations by us or our competitors and • adverse changes in the performance of our products as a result we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our revenue and results of operations may not be meaningful and that these comparisons may not be an accurate indicator of our future performance our results of operations in one or more future quarters may fail to meet the expectations of investment research analysts or investors which could cause an immediate and significant decline in the trading price of our ordinary shares 

difficulty in predicting quarterly demand—if we fail to predict demand accurately for our products in any quarter we may not be able to recapture the cost of our investments 

the disk drive industry operates on quarterly purchasing cycles with much of the order flow in any given quarter typically coming at the end of that quarter our manufacturing process requires us to make significant productspecific investments in inventory in each quarter for that quarters production since we typically receive the bulk of our orders late in a quarter after we have made our investments there is a risk that our orders will not be sufficient to allow us to recapture the costs of our investment before the products resulting from that investment have become obsolete we cannot assure you that we will be able to accurately predict demand in the future 

the difficulty in forecasting demand also increases the difficulty in anticipating our inventory requirements which may cause us to overproduce finished goods resulting in inventory writeoffs or underproduce finished goods affecting our ability to meet customer requirements additionally the risk of inventory writeoffs could increase if we were to continue to hold higher inventory levels we cannot be certain that we will be able to recover the costs associated with increased inventory 

other factors that may negatively impact our ability to recapture the cost of investments in any given quarter include 

• the impact of variable demand and an aggressive pricing environment for disk drives • the impact of competitive product announcements and possible excess industry supply both with respect to particular disk drive products and with respect to competing alternative storage technology solutions such as ssds in tablet notebook and enterprise compute applications • our inability to reduce our fixed costs to match sales in any quarter because of our vertical manufacturing strategy which means that we make more capital investments than we would if we were not vertically integrated • dependence on our ability to successfully qualify manufacture and sell in increasing volumes on a costeffective basis and with acceptable quality our disk drive products particularly the new disk drive products with lower cost structures • variations in the cost of components for our products especially during periods when the us dollar is relatively volatile as compared to other currencies 20 

• uncertainty in the amount of purchases from our distributor customers who from time to time constitute a large portion of our total sales • our product mix and the related margins of the various products • accelerated reduction in the price of our disk drives due to technological advances andor an oversupply of disk drives in the market and shifting trends in demand which can create supply and demand imbalances • manufacturing delays or interruptions particularly at our manufacturing facilities in china malaysia northern ireland singapore thailand or the united states • limited access to components that we obtain from a single or a limited number of suppliers • the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the cost of producing our products and the effective price of our products to foreign consumers and • operational issues arising out of the increasingly automated nature of our manufacturing processes new product offerings—market acceptance of new product introductions cannot be accurately predicted and our results of operations will suffer if there is less demand for our new products than is anticipated 

we are continually developing new products with the goal that we will be able to introduce technologically advanced and lower cost disk drives into the marketplace ahead of our competitors 

the success of our new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors including market acceptance our ability to manage the risks associated with product transitions the effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand and the risk that our new products will have quality problems or other defects in the early stages of introduction that were not anticipated in the design of those products accordingly we cannot accurately determine the ultimate effect that our new products will have on our results of operations 

in addition the success of our new product introductions is dependent upon our ability to qualify as a primary source of supply with our oem customers in order for our products to be considered by our customers for qualification we must be among the leaders in timetomarket with those new products once a product is accepted for qualification testing any failure or delay in the qualification process or a requirement that we requalify can result in our losing sales to that customer until new products are introduced the limited number of highvolume oems magnifies the effect of missing a product qualification opportunity these risks are further magnified because we expect competitive pressures to result in declining sales eroding prices and declining gross margins on our current generation products we cannot assure that we will be among the leaders in timetomarket with new products or that we will be able to successfully qualify new products with our customers in the future 

if we cannot successfully deliver competitive products our future results of operations may be adversely affected 

smaller form factor products—if we do not continue to successfully market smaller form factor products our business may suffer 

the disk drive industry is experiencing significant increases in sales of smaller form factor disk drives or other electronic data storage technologies for an expanding number of applications in particular notebook computers and consumer electronic devices but also in personal computers and enterprise storage applications our future success will depend on our ability to develop and introduce smaller form factor products at desired price and capacity points faster than our competitors 

we have experienced competition from other companies that produce alternative storage technologies like solid state or flash memory where increased capacity improving cost energy efficiency and 

performance ruggedness have resulted in flash memory largely replacing disk drives in handheld applications we believe that the demand for disk drives to store or back up related media content from such handheld devices however continues to grow while this competition has traditionally been limited to the markets for handheld consumer electronics applications these competitors have announced ssds for tablet notebook and enterprise compute applications 

if we do not suitably adapt our product offerings to successfully introduce additional smaller form factor disk drives or alternative storage products based on flash storage technology or if our competitors are successful in achieving customer acceptance of ssd products for tablet notebook and enterprise compute applications then our customers may decrease the amounts of our products that they purchase which would adversely affect our results of operations 

dependence on supply of components equipment and raw materials—if we experience shortages or delays in the receipt of or cost increases in critical components equipment or raw materials necessary to manufacture our products we may suffer lower operating margins production delays and other material adverse effects 

the cost quality and supply of components certain equipment and raw materials used to manufacture disk drives and key components like recording media and heads are critical to our success the equipment we use to manufacture our products and components is frequently custom made and comes from a few suppliers and the lead times required to obtain manufacturing equipment can be significant particularly important components for disk drives include readwrite heads aluminum or glass substrates for recording media asics spindle motors printed circuit boards and suspension assemblies we rely on sole suppliers or a limited number of suppliers for some of these components that we do not manufacture including aluminum and glass substrates readwrite heads asics spindle motors printed circuit boards and suspension assemblies many of such component suppliers are geographically concentrated in particular in thailand which makes our supply chain more vulnerable to regional disruptions such as the recent flooding in thailand which has had a material impact on the production and availability of many components if our vendors for these components are unable to meet our cost quality and supply requirements we could experience a shortage in supply or an increase in production costs which would adversely affect our results of operations 

certain rare earth elements are critical in the manufacture of our products we purchase components that contain rare earth elements from a number of countries including the peoples republic of china we cannot predict whether any nation will impose regulations quotas or embargoes upon the rare earth elements incorporated into our products that would restrict the worldwide supply of such metals or increase their cost we have experienced increased costs and production delays when we were unable to obtain the necessary equipment or sufficient quantities of some components andor have been forced to pay higher prices or make volume purchase commitments or advance deposits for some components equipment or raw materials that were in short supply in the industry in general if any major supplier were to restrict the supply available to us or increase the cost of the rare earth elements used in our products we could experience a shortage in supply or an increase in production costs which would adversely affect our results of operations 

consolidation among component manufacturers may result in some component manufacturers exiting the industry or not making sufficient investments in research to develop new components 

if there is a shortage of or delay in supplying us with critical components equipment or raw materials then 

• it is likely that our suppliers would raise their prices and if we could not pass these price increases to our customers our operating margin would decline 22 

• we might have to reengineer some products which would likely cause production and shipment delays make the reengineered products more costly and provide us with a lower rate of return on these products • we would likely have to allocate the components we receive to certain of our products and ship less of others which could reduce our revenues and could cause us to lose sales to customers who could purchase more of their required products from manufacturers that either did not experience these shortages or delays or that made different allocations and • we might be late in shipping products causing potential customers to make purchases from our competitors thus causing our revenue and operating margin to decline we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain critical components in a timely and economic manner 

importance of timetomaturity—our results of operations may depend on our being among the firsttomaturity with new product offerings and achieving sufficient production volume with our new products 

to achieve consistent success with our oem customers it is important that we be an early provider of new types of disk drives featuring leading highquality technology and lower per gigabyte storage cost historically our results of operations have substantially depended upon our ability to be among the firsttomaturity with new product offerings our market share and results of operations in the future may be adversely affected if we fail to 

• consistently maintain our timetomaturity performance with our new products • produce these products in sufficient volume • qualify these products with key customers on a timely basis by meeting our customers performance and quality specifications or • achieve acceptable manufacturing yields quality and costs with these products if the delivery of our products is delayed our oem customers may use our competitors products to meet their production requirements if the delay of our products causes delivery of those oems computer systems into which our products are integrated to be delayed consumers and businesses may purchase comparable products from the oems competitors 

we face the related risk that consumers and businesses may wait to make their purchases if they want to buy a new product that has been shipped or announced but not yet released if this were to occur we may be unable to sell our existing inventory of products that may be less efficient and cost effective compared to new products as a result even if we are among the firsttomaturity with a given product subsequent introductions or announcements by our competitors of new products could cause us to lose revenue and not achieve a positive return on our investment in existing products and inventory 

industry demand—poor global economic conditions and changes in demand for computer systems and storage subsystems may cause in the future a decline in demand for our products 

our disk drives are components in computers computer systems storage subsystems and consumer electronics devices the demand for these products has been volatile during times of poor global economic conditions consumer spending tends to decline and retail demand for personal computers and consumer electronics devices tends to decrease as does enterprise demand for computer systems and storage subsystems moreover unexpected slowdowns in demand for computer systems storage subsystems or consumer electronics devices generally cause sharp declines in demand for disk drive products the decline in consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services and on our financial condition and results of operations 

additional causes of declines in demand for our products in the past have included announcements or introductions of major new operating systems or semiconductor improvements or changes in consumer preferences such as the shift to mobile devices we believe these announcements and introductions have from time to time caused consumers to defer their purchases and made inventory obsolete whenever an oversupply of disk drives causes participants in our industry to have higher than anticipated inventory levels we experience even more intense price competition from other disk drive manufacturers than usual 

dependence on distributors—we are dependent on sales to distributors and retailers which may increase price erosion and the volatility of our sales 

a substantial portion of our sales has been to distributors of disk drive products certain of our distributors may also market other products that compete with our products product qualification programs in this distribution channel are limited which increases the number of competing products that are available to satisfy demand particularly in times of lengthening product cycles as a result purchasing decisions in this channel are based largely on price terms and product availability sales volumes through this channel are also less predictable and subject to greater volatility than sales to our oem customers in addition deterioration in business and economic conditions could exacerbate price erosion and volatility as distributors lower prices to compensate for lower demand and higher inventory levels our distributors ability to access credit for purposes of funding their operations may also affect purchases of our products by these customers 

if distributors reduce their purchases of our products or prices decline significantly in the distribution channel or if distributors experience financial difficulties or terminate their relationships with us our revenues and results of operations would be adversely affected 

dependence on key customers—we may be adversely affected by the loss of or reduced delayed or cancelled purchases by one or more of our larger customers 

some of our key customers account for a large portion of our disk drive revenue while we have longstanding relationships with many of our customers if any of our key customers were to significantly reduce their purchases from us our results of operations would be adversely affected while sales to major customers may vary from period to period a major customer that permanently discontinues or significantly reduces its relationship with us could be difficult to replace in line with industry practice new customers usually require that we pass a lengthy and rigorous qualification process at the customers cost accordingly it may be difficult or costly for us to attract new major customers additionally mergers acquisitions consolidations or other significant transactions involving our customers generally entail risks to our business if a significant transaction involving any of our key customers results in the loss of or reduction in purchases by these key customers it could have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and prospects 

dependence on sales of disk drives in client noncompute applications—our sales of disk drives for client noncompute applications which have contributed significant revenues to our results can experience significant volatility due to seasonal and other factors which could materially adversely impact our future results of operations 

sales of disk drives for client noncompute applications have contributed significant revenues to our results consumer spending on client noncompute has and may continue to deteriorate in many countries and regions due to poor global economic conditions and high levels of unemployment this could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services and on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition the demand for client noncompute products can be even more volatile and unpredictable than the demand for client compute products in some cases our products manufactured for client noncompute applications are uniquely configured for a single customers application which creates a risk 

of unwanted and unsellable inventory if the anticipated volumes are not realized this potential for unpredictable volatility is increased by the possibility of competing alternative storage technologies like flash memory meeting the customers cost and capacity metrics resulting in a rapid shift in demand from our products and disk drive technology generally to alternative storage technologies unpredictable fluctuations in demand for our products or rapid shifts in demand from our products to alternative storage technologies in new client noncompute applications could materially adversely impact our future results of operations 

dependence on sales of disk drives directly to consumers through retail outlets—our sales of disk drives directly to consumers through retail outlets can experience significant volatility due to seasonal and other factors which could materially adversely impact our future results of operations 

we believe that industry demand for storage products in the longterm is increasing due to the proliferation of mediarich digital content in consumer applications and is fueling increased consumer demand for storage this has led to the expansion of solutions such as external storage products to provide additional storage capacity and to secure data in case of disaster or system failure or to provide independent storage solutions for multiple users in home or small business environments consumer spending on retail sales of our branded solutions has deteriorated in some markets and may continue to do so if poor global economic conditions continue and higher levels of unemployment persist this could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services and on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition such retail sales of our branded solutions traditionally experience seasonal variability in demand with higher levels of demand in the first half of our fiscal year driven by consumer spending in the backtoschool season from late summer to fall and the traditional holiday shopping season from fall to winter additionally our ability to reach such consumers depends on our maintaining effective working relationships with major retailers and distributors failure to anticipate consumer demand for our branded solutions as well as an inability to maintain effective working relationships with retail and online distributors may adversely impact our future results of operations 

importance of controlling operating costs—if we do not control our operating expenses we will not be able to compete effectively in our industry 

our strategy involves to a substantial degree increasing revenue and product volume while at the same time controlling operating expenses if we do not control our operating expenses our ability to compete in the marketplace may be impaired in the past activities to reduce operating costs have included closures and transfers of facilities significant personnel reductions and efforts to increase automation the reduction of personnel and closure of facilities may adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in required volumes to meet customer demand and may result in other disruptions that affect our products and customer service 

impairment charges—we may be required to record impairment charges for goodwill andor other longlived assets 

we are required to assess goodwill annually for impairment or on an interim basis whenever events occur or circumstances change such as an adverse change in business climate or a decline in the overall industry that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount we are also required to test other longlived assets including acquired intangible assets and property equipment and leasehold improvements for recoverability and impairment whenever there are indicators of impairment such as an adverse change in business climate 

adverse changes in business conditions could materially impact our estimates of future operations and result in impairment charges to our goodwill or other long lived assets if our goodwill or other longlived assets were to become impaired our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

impact of technological change—increases in the areal density of disk drives may outpace customers demand for storage capacity 

the rate of increase in areal density or storage capacity per square inch on a disk may be greater than the increase in our customers demand for aggregate storage capacity particularly in certain market applications like client compute as a result our customers storage capacity needs may be satisfied with lower priced low capacity disk drives these factors could decrease our sales especially when combined with continued price erosion which could adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in electronic data storage products—future changes in the nature of electronic data storage products may reduce demand for traditional disk drive products 

we expect that in the future new personal computing devices and products will be developed some of which such as internet appliances tablet or mobile phones with advanced capabilities or smartphones may not contain a disk drive while we are investing development resources in designing disk drives for these new applications these new applications may have an impact on future demand for disk drive products products using alternative technologies such as flash memory and other storage technologies are becoming increasingly common and could become a significant source of competition to particular applications of our products which could adversely affect our results of operations 

new product development and technological change—if we do not develop products in time to keep pace with technological changes our results of operations will be adversely affected 

our customers have demanded new generations of disk drive products as advances in computer hardware and software have created the need for improved storage products with features such as increased storage capacity improved performance and reliability and lower cost we and our competitors have developed improved products and we will need to continue to do so in the future such product development requires significant investments in research and development we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully complete the design or introduction of new products in a timely manner that we will be able to manufacture new products in sufficient volumes with acceptable manufacturing yields that we will be able to successfully market these new products or that these products will perform to specifications on a longterm basis in addition the impact of slowing areal density growth may adversely impact our ability to be successful 

when we develop new products with higher capacity and more advanced technology our results of operations may decline because the increased difficulty and complexity associated with producing these products increases the likelihood of reliability quality or operability problems if our products suffer increases in failures are of low quality or are not reliable customers may reduce their purchases of our products and our manufacturing rework and scrap costs and service and warranty costs may increase in addition a decline in the reliability of our products may make us less competitive as compared with other disk drive manufacturers or competing technologies 

substantial leverage—our substantial leverage may place us at a competitive disadvantage in our industry 

we are leveraged and have significant debt service obligations our significant debt and debt service requirements could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take 

advantage of potential business opportunities for example our high level of debt presents the following risks 

• we are required to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements • our substantial leverage increases our vulnerability to economic downturns and adverse competitive and industry conditions and could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that are less leveraged • our debt service obligations could limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry and could limit our ability to pursue other business opportunities borrow more money for operations or capital in the future and implement our business strategies • our level of debt may restrict us from raising additional financing on satisfactory terms to fund working capital capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements and • covenants in our debt instruments limit our ability to pay future dividends or make other restricted payments and investments in the event that we need to refinance all or a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures we may not be able to obtain terms as favorable as the terms of our existing debt or refinance our existing debt at all if prevailing interest rates or other factors existing at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing then the interest expense relating to the refinanced debt would increase furthermore if any rating agency changes our credit rating or outlook our debt and equity securities could be negatively affected which could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt or raise additional capital 

significant debt service requirements—servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate cash may be affected by factors beyond our control 

our business may not generate cash flow in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay the principal of or interest on our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs including working capital capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements 

our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control we cannot assure you that 

• our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations • we will continue to realize the cost savings revenue growth and operating improvements that result from the execution of our longterm strategic plan or • future sources of funding will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs if we cannot fund our liquidity needs we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements we cannot assure you that any of these remedies could if necessary be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all or that they would permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations in addition if we incur additional debt the risks associated with our substantial leverage including the risk that we will be unable to service our debt or generate enough cash flow to fund our liquidity needs could intensify 

failure to pay quarterly dividends—our failure to pay quarterly dividends to our shareholders could cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline significantly 

our ability to pay quarterly dividends will be subject to among other things our financial position and results of operations available cash and cash flow capital requirements and other factors any reduction or discontinuation of quarterly dividends could cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline significantly moreover in the event our payment of quarterly dividends is reduced or discontinued our failure or inability to resume paying dividends at historical levels could result in a persistently low market valuation of our ordinary shares 

purchase commitments to certain suppliers—if revenues fall or customer demand decreases significantly we may not meet all of our purchase commitments to certain suppliers 

from time to time we enter into longterm noncancelable purchase commitments with certain suppliers in order to secure certain components for the production of our products or to supplement our internal manufacturing capacity for certain components if our actual revenues in the future are lower than our projections or if customer demand decreases significantly below our projections we may not meet all of our purchase commitments with these suppliers as a result it is possible that we will have to shift output from our internal manufacturing facilities to these suppliers or make penaltytype payments under these contracts 

risks associated with future strategic alliances joint ventures or investments—we may not be able to identify suitable strategic alliances acquisitions joint ventures or investment opportunities or successfully acquire and integrate companies that provide complementary products or technologies 

our growth strategy may involve pursuing strategic alliances with making acquisitions of forming joint ventures with or making investments in other companies that are complementary to our business there is substantial competition for attractive strategic alliance acquisition joint venture and investment candidates accordingly we may not be able to identify suitable strategic alliances acquisition joint venture or investment candidates even if we can identify them we cannot assure you that we will be able to partner with acquire or invest in suitable candidates or integrate acquired technologies or operations successfully into our existing technologies and operations moreover our ability to finance potential strategic alliances acquisitions joint ventures or investments will be limited by our high degree of leverage the covenants contained in the indentures that govern our outstanding indebtedness and any agreements governing any other debt we may incur 

if we are successful in forming strategic alliances or acquiring forming joint ventures or making investments in other companies any of these transactions may have an adverse effect on our results of operations particularly while the operations of an acquired business are being integrated it is also likely that integration of acquired companies would lead to the loss of key employees from those companies or the loss of customers of those companies in addition the integration of any acquired companies would require substantial attention from our senior management which may limit the amount of time available to be devoted to our daytoday operations or to the execution of our strategy growth by strategic alliance acquisition joint venture or investment involves an even higher degree of risk to the extent we combine new product offerings and enter new markets in which we have limited experience and no assurance can be given that acquisitions of entities with new or alternative business models will be successfully integrated or achieve their stated objectives 

furthermore the expansion of our business involves the risk that we might not manage our growth effectively that we would incur additional debt to finance these acquisitions or investments that we may have impairment of goodwill or acquired intangible assets associated with these acquisitions and that we would incur substantial charges relating to the writeoff of inprocess research and development similar to 

that which we incurred in connection with several of our prior acquisitions each of these items could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we could issue additional ordinary shares in connection with future strategic alliances acquisitions joint ventures or investments issuing shares in connection with such transactions would have the effect of diluting your ownership percentage of the ordinary shares and could cause the price of our ordinary shares to decline 

risk of intellectual property litigation—we are at times subject to intellectual property legal proceedings and claims which could which could cause us to incur significant additional costs or prevent us from selling our products and which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject from timetotime to legal proceedings and claims including claims of alleged infringement of the patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties by us or our customers in connection with their use of our products intellectual property litigation can be expensive and timeconsuming regardless of the merits of any claim and could divert our managements attention from operating our business in addition intellectual property lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties due to the complexity of the technical issues involved which may cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations patent litigation has increased due to the current uncertainty of the law and the increasing competition and overlap of product functionality in the field some of the actions that we face from timetotime seek injunctions against the sale of our products andor substantial monetary damages which if granted or awarded could materially harm our business financial condition and operating results 

we cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of others we may not be aware of currently filed patent applications that relate to our products or technology if patents are later issued on these applications we may be liable for infringement if our products were found to infringe the intellectual property rights of others we could be required to pay substantial damages cease the manufacture use and sale of infringing products in one or more geographic locations expend significant resources to develop noninfringing technology discontinue the use of specific processes or obtain licenses to the technology infringed we might not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms or at all or be able to reengineer our products successfully to avoid infringement any of the foregoing could cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling our products which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition see part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data—note 14 legal environmental and other contingencies of this annual report on form 10k for a description of pending intellectual property proceedings 

protection of our intellectual property—we may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect our ip rights in the past we have been involved in significant and expensive disputes regarding our ip rights and those of others including claims that we may be infringing patents trademarks and other ip rights of thirdparties we expect that we will be involved in similar disputes in the future 

there can be no assurance that 

• any of our existing patents will continue to be held valid if challenged • patents will be issued for any of our pending applications • any claims allowed from existing or pending patents will have sufficient scope or strength to protect us or • our patents will be issued in the primary countries where our products are sold in order to protect our rights and potential commercial advantage in addition our competitors may be able to design their products around our patents and other proprietary rights enforcement of our rights often requires litigation if we bring a patent infringement action and are not successful our competitors would be able to use similar technology to compete with us moreover the defendant in such an action may successfully countersue us for infringement of their patents or assert a counterclaim that our patents are invalid or unenforceable 

cyber attacks system failures and breaches—we could suffer a loss of revenue and increased costs exposure to significant liability reputational harm and other serious negative consequences if we sustain cyber attacks or other data security breaches that disrupt our operations or result in the dissemination of proprietary or confidential information about us or our customers or other thirdparties 

our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer equipment and the electronic data stored in our databases from damage by among other things earthquake fire natural disasters accidents power disruptions telecommunications failures acts of terrorism or war employee misconduct physical or electronic breakins or similar events or disruptions we manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our operations in addition our outsourcing services and cloud computing businesses routinely process store and transmit large amounts of data for our customers and vendors including sensitive and personally identifiable information as our operations become more automated and increasingly interdependent our exposure to the risks posed by these types of events will increase we may also be subject to breaches of the information technology systems we use for these purposes information technology system failures and network disruptions experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of thirdparties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products in addition sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from thirdparties may contain defects in design or manufacture including bugs and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system 

the costs to us to eliminate or address the foregoing security problems and security vulnerabilities before or after a cyber incident could be significant system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions we could lose existing or potential customers for outsourcing services or other information technology solutions in connection with any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products in addition breaches of our security measures and the unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers or other thirdparties could expose us our vendors and customers or other thirdparties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business in addition we rely in certain limited capacities on thirdparty data management providers whose possible security problems and security vulnerabilities may have similar effects on us 

we are subject to laws rules and regulations in the us and other countries relating to the collection use and security of user data our ability to execute transactions and to possess and use personal information and data in conducting our business subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens that may require us to notify vendors customers or employees of a data security breach we have incurred and will continue to incur significant expenses to comply with mandatory privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law regulation industry standards or contractual obligations 

economic risks associated with international operations—our international operations subject us to risks related to currency exchange fluctuations longer payment cycles for sales in foreign countries seasonality and disruptions in foreign markets tariffs and duties price controls potential adverse tax consequences increased costs our customers credit and access to capital and healthrelated risks 

we have significant operations in foreign countries including manufacturing facilities sales personnel and customer support operations we have manufacturing facilities in china malaysia northern ireland singapore and thailand in addition to those in the united states a substantial portion of our client compute disk drive assembly occurs in our facility in china 

our international operations are subject to economic risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries including the following 

• disruptions in foreign markets disruptions in financial markets and the deterioration of the underlying economic conditions in the past in some countries including those in asia have had an impact on our sales to customers located in or whose enduser customers are located in these countries • fluctuations in currency exchange rates prices for our products are denominated predominately in us dollars even when sold to customers that are located outside the united states currency instability in asia and other geographic markets may make our products more expensive than products sold by other manufacturers that are priced in the local currency moreover many of the costs associated with our operations located outside the united states are denominated in local currencies as a consequence the increased strength of local currencies against the us dollar in countries where we have foreign operations would result in higher effective operating costs and potentially reduced earnings from time to time fluctuations in foreign exchange rates have negatively affected our operations and profitability and there can be no assurance that these fluctuations will not adversely affect our operations and profitability in the future we may attempt to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes by among other things entering into foreign currency forward exchange contracts however these contracts may not cover our full exposure and subject us to certain counterparty credit risks see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk—foreign currency exchange risk of this annual report on form 10k additional information about our foreign currency exchange risk • longer payment cycles our customers outside of the united states are often allowed longer time periods for payment than our us customers this increases the risk of nonpayment due to the possibility that the financial condition of particular customers may worsen during the course of the payment period • seasonality seasonal reductions in the business activities of our customers during the summer months particularly in europe typically result in lower earnings during those periods • tariffs duties limitations on trade and price controls our international operations are affected by limitations on imports currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations price controls and other restraints on trade in addition the governments of many countries including china malaysia northern ireland singapore and thailand in which we have significant operating 31 

assets have exercised and continue to exercise significant influence over many aspects of their domestic economies and international trade 

• potential adverse tax consequences our international operations create a risk of potential adverse tax consequences including imposition of withholding or other taxes on payments by subsidiaries • increased costs the shipping and transportation costs associated with our international operations are typically higher than those associated with our us operations resulting in decreased operating margins in some foreign countries • credit and access to capital risks our international customers could have reduced access to working capital due to higher interest rates reduced bank lending resulting from contractions in the money supply or the deterioration in the customers or its banks financial condition or the inability to access other financing • global health outbreaks the occurrence of a pandemic disease may adversely impact our operations and some of our key customers such diseases could also potentially disrupt the timeliness and reliability of the distribution network we rely on political risks associated with international operations—our international operations subject us to risks related to economic conditions political unrest and terrorism 

we have manufacturing facilities in parts of the world that periodically experience political unrest this could disrupt our ability to manufacture important components as well as cause interruptions andor delays in our ability to ship components to other locations for continued manufacture and assembly any such delays or interruptions could result in delays in our ability to fill orders and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition us and international responses to the ongoing hostilities in various regions and the risk of terrorist attacks or hostilities elsewhere in the world could exacerbate these risks 

macroeconomic developments like the debt crisis in certain countries in the european union and slowing economies in parts of asia and south america could negatively affect our business operating results or financial condition which in turn could adversely affect our stock price a general weakening of and related declining corporate confidence in the global economy or the curtailment in government or corporate spending could cause current or potential customers to reduce their information technology it budgets or be unable to fund hardware systems which could cause customers to delay decrease or cancel purchases of our products or cause customers not to pay us or to delay paying us for previously purchased products and services 

in addition political unrest in regions like the middle east terrorist attacks around the globe and the potential for other hostilities in various parts of the world potential public health crises and natural disasters continue to contribute to a climate of economic and political uncertainty that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition including our revenue growth and profitability these factors generally have the strongest effect on our sales 

legal and operational risks associated with international operations—our international operations subject us to risks related to staffing and management legal and regulatory requirements and the protection of intellectual property 

operating outside of the united states creates difficulties associated with staffing and managing our international manufacturing facilities complying with local legal and regulatory requirements and protecting our intellectual property we cannot assure you that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with applicable customs currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which we may be subject we also cannot assure you that these laws will not be modified 

dependence on key personnel—the loss of key executive officers and employees could negatively impact our business prospects 

our future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued service of key members of management as well as marketing sales and product development personnel the loss of one or more of our key personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we believe our future success will also depend in large part upon our ability to attract retain and further motivate highly skilled management marketing sales and product development personnel we have experienced intense competition for personnel and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our key employees or that we will be successful in attracting assimilating and retaining personnel in the future 

securities litigation—significant fluctuations in the market price of our ordinary shares could result in securities class action claims against us 

significant price and value fluctuations have occurred with respect to the publicly traded securities of disk drive companies and technology companies generally the price of our ordinary shares is likely to be volatile in the future in the past following periods of decline in the market price of a companys securities class action lawsuits have often been pursued against that company if similar litigation were pursued against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources which could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

global credit and financial market conditions—deterioration in global credit and financial market conditions could negatively impact the value of our current portfolio of cash equivalents or shortterm investments and our ability to meet our financing objectives 

our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase our shortterm investments consist primarily of readily marketable debt securities with remaining maturities of more than 90 days at the time of purchase our investment policy has as its principal objectives the preservation of principal and maintenance of liquidity we mitigate default risk by investing in highquality investment grade securities limiting the time to maturity and by monitoring the counterparties and underlying obligors closely 

while as of the date of this filing we are not aware of any other material downgrades losses or other significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or shortterm investments  no assurance can be given that further deterioration in conditions of the global credit and financial markets would not negatively impact our current portfolio of cash equivalents or shortterm investments or our ability to meet our financing objectives 

environmental regulations—failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the sale and manufacturing of products in certain states and countries may subject us and our suppliers to state federal and international laws and regulations governing protection of the environment including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites restrictions on the presence of certain substances in electronic products and the responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling we endeavor to ensure that we and our suppliers comply with all applicable environmental laws and regulations however compliance may increase our operating costs and otherwise impact future financial results if additional or more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future we could incur additional operating costs and capital expenditures if we fail to comply with applicable environmental laws regulations initiatives or standards of conduct our customers may refuse to purchase our products and we could be subject to fines penalties and possible prohibition of sales of our products into one or 

more states or countries liability to our customers and damage to our reputation which could result in a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations 

new conflict minerals regulations may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products 

in august 2012 the sec adopted new rules establishing additional disclosure and reporting requirements regarding the use of specified minerals or conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured these new rules will require us to determine disclose and report whether or not such conflict minerals originate from the democratic republic of the congo or an adjoining country the first such report being due on may 31 2014 these new rules could affect our ability to source certain materials used in our products at competitive prices and could impact the availability of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products including gold tantalum tin and tungsten as there may be only a limited number of suppliers of conflict free minerals we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary conflict free minerals in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices our customers including our oem customers may require that our products be free of conflict minerals and our revenues and margins may be harmed if we are unable to procure conflict free minerals at a reasonable price or at all or are unable to pass through any increased costs associated with meeting these demands additionally we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of all minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement we may also face challenges with government regulators and our customers and suppliers if we are unable to sufficiently verify that the metals used in our products are conflict free we expect that there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements such as costs related to determining the source of certain minerals used in our products as well as costs related to possible changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification and disclosure requirements 

seasonality—because we experience seasonality in the sales of our products our results of operations will generally be adversely impacted during the second half of our fiscal year 

sales of computer systems storage subsystems and consumer electronics tend to be seasonal and therefore we expect to continue to experience seasonality in our business as we respond to variations in our customers demand for disk drives in particular we anticipate that sales of our products will continue to be lower during the second half of our fiscal year in the client compute and client noncompute market applications of our business this seasonality is partially attributable to the historical trend in our results derived from our customers increased sales of desktop computers notebook computers and consumer electronics during the backtoschool and winter holiday season in the enterprise market our sales are seasonal because of the capital budgeting and purchasing cycles of our end users since our working capital needs peak during periods in which we are increasing production in anticipation of orders that have not yet been received our results of operations will fluctuate seasonally even if the forecasted demand for our products proves accurate furthermore it is difficult for us to evaluate the degree to which this seasonality may affect our business in future periods because of the rate and unpredictability of product transitions and new product introductions particularly in the client noncompute market as well as macroeconomic conditions 

volatile public markets—the price of our ordinary shares may be volatile and could decline significantly 

the stock market in general and the market for technology stocks in particular has recently experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of companies if these market or industrybased fluctuations continue the trading price of our ordinary shares could decline significantly independent of our actual operating performance and you could lose all or a substantial part 

of your investment the market price of our ordinary shares could fluctuate significantly in response to several factors including among others 

• general uncertainty in stock market conditions occasioned by global economic conditions negative financial news and the continued instability of several large financial institutions • actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations • announcements of innovations new products or significant price reductions by us or our competitors including those competitors who offer alternative storage technology solutions • our failure to meet the performance estimates of investment research analysts • the timing of announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts or acquisitions • general stock market conditions • the occurrence of major catastrophic events • changes in financial estimates by investment research analysts • changes in the credit ratings of our indebtedness by rating agencies and • the sale of our ordinary shares held by certain equity investors or members of management political events war terrorism natural disasters public health issues and other circumstances could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

war terrorism geopolitical uncertainties natural disasters public health issues and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy and thus could have a strong negative effect on our business our suppliers logistics providers manufacturing vendors and customers our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes fire power shortages terrorist attacks other hostile acts labor disputes public health issues and other events beyond our control such events could decrease demand for our products make it difficult or impossible for us to make and deliver products to our customers or to receive components from our suppliers and create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain in the event of a natural disaster losses and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations and our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected should major public health issues including pandemics arise we could be negatively affected by stringent employee travel restrictions additional limitations in freight services governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in our operations and some of our key customers 

if we do not realize the expected benefits of our strategic alignment with samsung our business and financial condition may be materially impaired 

we may not achieve the desired benefits from our strategic alignment with samsung even if we are able to successfully integrate the business that we acquired from samsung into our business we may not be able to realize the cost savings synergies and growth that we anticipate from this transaction in the timeframe we currently expect and the costs of achieving these benefits may be higher than we currently expect because of a number of risks including but not limited to 

• the possibility that the transaction may not further our business strategy as we expected • our operating results or financial condition may be adversely impacted by liabilities that we assume in the transaction and • the risk of intellectual property disputes with respect to the acquired assets 35 

in addition the chinese ministry of commerce conditioned its approval of the samsung acquisition on our compliance with several ongoing requirements including adopting measures to keep the samsung hdd brand as a separate competitor to the seagate hdd brand expanding the samsung hdd production capacity within six months of the decision and investing at least 800 million per year for three years in rd in our combined samsung and seagate hdd businesses compliance with these obligations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practices that result in reduced revenue noncompliance could result in extending the time under which we would be compelled to operate under these conditions 

as a result of these risks the transaction may not contribute to our earnings as we expected we may not achieve expected cost synergies when expected or at all and we may not achieve the other anticipated strategic and financial benefits of this transaction 

our ability to use our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards might be limited 

at june 28 2013 the use of approximately 358 million and 90 million of our us net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards respectively is subject to an aggregate annual limitation of 45 million pursuant to us tax law to the extent these net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are available we intend to use them to reduce the corporate income tax liability associated with our operations in the us section 382 of the us internal revenue code generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards that might be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone significant changes in ownership as a result future changes in ownership such as changes in ownership resulting from future repurchases of our ordinary shares could put limitations on the availability of our net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards if certain ownership changes occur in the foreseeable future there may be an additional annual limitation on our ability to use our total us federal and state net operating loss and credit carryforwards of 28 billion 18 billion and 415 million respectively if these ownership changes were to occur we estimate a onetime charge for additional us income tax expense of approximately 400 to 500 million may be recorded in the period such change occurs this additional income tax expense results from a decrease in our net us deferred tax assets recorded through a combination of the write off of deferred tax assets and associated changes to our valuation allowance we also estimate that the ensuing additional annual limitation on our ability to use tax attribute carryovers may result in increased us income tax expense associated with such change of approximately 70 to 85 million each year

we produce a broad range of electronic data storage products including hdds solid state hybrid drives sshd and solid state drives ssd which address enterprise applications where our products are designed for enterprise servers mainframes and workstations client compute applications where our products are designed for desktop and notebook computers and client noncompute applications where our products are designed for a wide variety of end user devices such as digital video recorders dvrs gaming consoles personal data backup systems portable external storage systems and digital media systems in addition to manufacturing and selling data storage products we provide data storage services for small to mediumsized businesses including online backup data protection and recovery solutions 

business overview 

our industry is characterized by several trends and factors that have a material impact on our strategic planning financial condition and results of operations 

industry supply balance 

from time to time the industry has experienced periods of imbalance between supply and demand to the extent that the disk drive industry builds capacity based on expectations of demand that do not materialize price erosion may become more pronounced conversely during periods where demand exceeds supply price erosion is generally muted 

in early october 2011 floodwaters north of bangkok thailand inundated many manufacturing industrial parks that contained a number of the factories supporting the hdd industrys supply chain the hdd industry had concentrated a large portion of its supply chain participants within these industrial parks in an effort to reduce cost and improve logistics as a result the inundation of floodwaters into these industrial parks had caused the closure or suspension of production by a number of participants within the hdd supply chain 

during the supply chain disruption in fiscal year 2012 we believe demand exceeded supply due to the impact from the flooding in thailand resulting in an increase in the average selling price asp the industrys ability to manufacture and ship drives had substantially recovered as of the end of fiscal year 2012 during fiscal year 2013 price erosion has been relatively benign 

demand trends for disk drives 

we believe that continued growth in digital content requires increasingly higher storage capacity in order to store aggregate host distribute manage backup and use such content we also believe that as architectures evolve to serve the growing commercial and consumer user base throughout the world the manner which hard drives are delivered to market and utilized by our customers will evolve as well 

we believe that in the foreseeable future the traditional enterprise and client compute markets that require high capacity storage solutions as well as the data intensive client noncompute markets will continue to be best served by hard disk drives due to the industrys ability to deliver cost effective reliable and energy efficient mass storage devices furthermore the increased use of client noncompute devices that consume media rich content streamed from the cloud increases the demand for high capacity disk drives in nearline applications 

price erosion historically our industry has been characterized by price declines for disk drive products with comparable capacity performance and feature sets likeforlike products 

disk drive manufacturers typically attempt to offset price erosion with an improved mix of disk drive products characterized by higher capacity better performance and additional feature sets andor product cost reductions 

seasonality 

the disk drive industry traditionally experiences seasonal variability in demand with higher levels of demand in the second half of the calendar year this seasonality is driven by consumer spending in the backtoschool season from late summer to fall and the traditional holiday shopping season from fall to winter in addition corporate demand is typically higher during the second half of the calendar year 

fiscal year 2013 summary 

revenues for fiscal year 2013 were 144 billion while gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 27 we repurchased 54 million of our ordinary shares during the year for approximately 17 billion paid dividends of 05 billion paid 12 billion for the early redemption and repurchase of debt with a principal value of 11 billion and issued 10 billion of 475 senior notes due 2023 

results of operations 

we list in the table below summarized information from our consolidated statements of operations by dollars and as a percentage of revenue 





the following table summarizes information regarding volume shipments average selling prices asps and revenues by channel and geography 



fiscal year 2013 compared to fiscal year 2012 

revenue 



revenue in fiscal year 2013 decreased approximately 4 or 06 billion from fiscal year 2012 due to a decrease in the average selling price per unit the decrease in the average selling price to 63 per unit during fiscal year 2013 as compared to 66 per unit in the prior year was primarily due to supply constraints beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year 2012 as a result of the severe flooding in thailand partially offset by a favorable product mix and slightly higher volumes in fiscal year 2013 which included a full period of samsung labeled hdd products 

gross margin 



for fiscal year 2013 gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased to 27 from 31 in the prior fiscal year as a result of higher asps during fiscal year 2012 our asps during fiscal year 2012 were increased due to the limited industry supply of hard drives as a result of the severe flooding in thailand 

operating expenses 



product development expense product development expenses for fiscal year 2013 increased from fiscal year 2012 primarily due to increased investments in hdd and alternative storage technologies of approximately 84 million and headcount related costs of approximately 41 million net of a decrease in variable performance based compensation of approximately 7 million 

marketing and administrative expense marketing and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2013 increased from fiscal year 2012 primarily due to further investments in certain strategic initiatives as well as enhancement of our core business operations this along with our annual focal increases resulted in additional headcount related costs of 64 million net of a reduction in variable performance based compensation of 7 million in addition the consolidation of lacie in fiscal year 2013 contributed approximately 32 million to marketing and administrative expense 

amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles for fiscal year 2013 increased as a result of the acquisition of samsungs hdd business in december of 2011 and lacie in august of 2012 

restructuring and other net restructuring and other net for fiscal years 2013 and 2012 was not material and primarily related to previously announced restructuring plans 

other income expense net 



other expense net for fiscal year 2013 compared to fiscal year 2012 increased due to a loss of 141 million on the early redemption and repurchase of debt these losses were partially offset by gains recorded for sales of our available for sale securities and strategic investments of 61 million insurance proceeds of 25 million for equipment damaged during the severe flooding in thailand in october of 2011 and a decrease in interest expense of 27 million due to a reduction in our average interest rate and total debt levels 

income taxes 



we recorded an income tax benefit of 7 million for fiscal year 2013 compared to an income tax provision of 20 million for fiscal year 2012 our fiscal year 2013 benefit from income taxes included 52 million of income tax benefit from the reversal of a portion of the us valuation allowance recorded in prior periods our fiscal year 2012 provision for income taxes included 35 million of income tax benefit from the reversal of a portion of the us valuation allowance recorded in prior periods 

our irish tax resident parent holding company owns various us and nonus subsidiaries that operate in multiple nonirish tax jurisdictions our worldwide operating income is either subject to varying rates of tax or is exempt from tax due to tax holidays or tax incentive programs we operate under in malaysia singapore and thailand these tax holidays or incentives are scheduled to expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2020 

our income tax provision recorded for fiscal year 2013 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying the irish statutory rate of 25 to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i tax benefits related to nonus earnings generated in jurisdictions that are subject to tax holidays or tax incentive programs and are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of ireland and ii a decrease in valuation allowance for certain us deferred tax assets the acquisition of a majority interest in the outstanding shares of lacie did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2013 our income tax provision recorded for fiscal year 2012 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying the irish statutory rate of 25 to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i tax benefits related to nonus earnings generated in jurisdictions that are subject to tax holidays or tax incentive programs and are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of ireland and ii a decrease in valuation allowance for certain us deferred tax assets the acquisition of samsungs hdd business did not have a significant impact on our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2012 

the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 atra 2012 was enacted on january 2 2013 atra 2012 retroactively reinstated and extended the federal research and development tax credit rd credit from january 1 2012 to december 31 2013 as well as bonus depreciation on qualified property extension of the rd credit and bonus depreciation has no immediate impact on our income tax provision due to existing valuation allowances on our us deferred tax assets none of the other atra 2012 changes are expected to have a material impact on our income tax provision 

based on our nonus ownership structure and subject to i potential future increases in our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and ii a future change in our intention to indefinitely reinvest earnings from our subsidiaries outside of ireland we anticipate that our effective tax rate in future periods will generally be less than the irish statutory rate 

at june 28 2013 our deferred tax asset valuation allowance was approximately 989 million 

at june 28 2013 we had net deferred tax assets of 554 million the realization of these deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on our ability to generate sufficient us and certain nonus taxable income in future periods although realization is not assured we believe that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable however may increase or decrease in subsequent periods when we reevaluate the underlying basis for our estimates of future us and certain nonus taxable income 

as of june 28 2013 the use of approximately 358 million and 90 million of our total us net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards respectively is subject to an aggregate annual limitation of 45 million pursuant to us tax law if certain ownership changes occur in the foreseeable future there may be an additional annual limitation on our ability to use our total us federal and state net operating loss and credit carryforwards of 28 billion 18 billion and 415 million respectively it is reasonably possible that such a change could occur if these ownership changes were to occur we estimate a onetime charge for additional us income tax expense of approximately  400 to 500 million may be recorded in the period such change occurs this additional income tax expense results from a decrease in our net us deferred tax assets recorded through a combination of the write off of deferred tax assets and associated changes to our valuation allowance we also estimate that the ensuing additional annual limitation on our ability to use our tax attribute carryovers may result in increased us income tax expense associated with such change of approximately 70 to 85 million each year 

as of june 28 2013 and june 29 2012 we had approximately 157 million and 135 million respectively of unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties the unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would impact the effective tax rate is 157 million and 135 million as of june 28 2013 and june 29 2012 respectively subject to certain future valuation allowance reversals 

it is our policy to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for taxes on the consolidated statements of operations during fiscal year 2013 we recognized a net tax expense for interest and penalties of 2 million as compared to a net tax expense for interest and penalties of 2 million and less than 1 million during fiscal year 2012 and fiscal year 2011 respectively as of june 28 2013 we had 19 million of accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits compared to 17 million in fiscal year 2012 

during the fiscal year ended june 28 2013 our unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties increased by approximately 22 million primarily due to i increases in current year unrecognized tax benefits of 16 million ii net increases in prior year unrecognized tax benefits of 10 million iii reductions associated with the expiration of certain statutes of limitation of 5 million iv increases from other activity including nonus exchange gains of 1 million 

during the 12 months beginning june 29 2013 we expect to reduce our unrecognized tax benefits by approximately 3 million as a result of the expiration of certain statutes of limitation we do not believe it is reasonably possible that other unrecognized tax benefits will materially change in the next 12 months 

we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions globally and are required to file us federal us state and nonus income tax returns in february 2013 we reached a settlement with the irs on all issues related to fiscal years ending in 2005 through 2007 settlement of the issues in this period has no material impact on our financial statements we are no longer subject to tax examination of us federal income tax returns for years prior to fiscal year 2008 with respect to us state and nonus income tax returns we are generally no longer subject to tax examination for years prior to fiscal year 2004 

fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011 

revenue 



revenue in fiscal year 2012 increased approximately 36 or 40 billion from fiscal year 2011 due primarily to an increase in average selling price per unit and in total units shipped units shipped in fiscal year 2012 increased 13 or 25 million units from fiscal year 2011 the increase in the average selling price to 66 per unit during fiscal year 2012 as compared to 54 per unit in the prior year was primarily due to the limited industry supply of hard drives resulting from the severe flooding in thailand 

gross margin 



for fiscal year 2012 gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased to 31 from 20 in the prior fiscal year primarily due to the increased selling price per unit throughout most of fiscal year 2012 

operating expenses 



product development expense product development expenses for fiscal year 2012 increased from fiscal year 2011 primarily reflecting an increase in variable performancebased compensation and the integration of the hdd business acquired from samsung 

marketing and administrative expense the increase in marketing and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011 was primarily due to an increase in variable performancebased compensation and integration of the hdd business acquired from samsung 

amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles for fiscal year 2012 increased as a result of the acquisition of samsungs hdd business in december 2011 

restructuring and other net restructuring and other net for fiscal years 2012 and 2011 were not material and primarily related to previously announced restructuring plans 

other expense net 



other expense net for fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011 was relatively flat and included an increase in interest expense resulting from higher average debt balances substantially offset by gains on foreign currency remeasurement 

income taxes 



we recorded an income tax provision of 20 million for fiscal year 2012 compared to an income tax provision of 68 million for fiscal year 2011 our fiscal year 2012 provision for income taxes included 35 million of income tax benefit from the reversal of a portion of the us valuation allowance recorded in prior periods our fiscal year 2011 provision for income taxes included nonus income taxes recorded for increases in income tax reserves for nonus income tax positions taken in prior fiscal years partially offset by tax benefits recorded for the release of income tax reserves associated with settlements of income tax audits and the expiration of certain statutes of limitation 

our income tax provision recorded for fiscal year 2012 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying the irish statutory rate of 25 to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i tax benefits related to nonus earnings generated in jurisdictions that are subject to tax holidays or tax incentive programs and are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of ireland and ii a decrease in valuation allowance for certain us deferred tax assets the acquisition of samsungs hdd business did not have a significant impact on our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2012 our income tax provision recorded for the comparative fiscal year ended july 1 2011 differed the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying the irish statutory rate of 25 to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i tax benefits related to nonus earnings generated in jurisdictions that are subject to tax holidays or tax incentive programs and are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of ireland ii income tax expense related to intercompany transactions iii a decrease in valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets and iv nonus losses with no tax benefit 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following sections discuss our principal liquidity requirements as well as our sources and uses of cash and our liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase our shortterm investments consist primarily of readily marketable securities with remaining maturities of more than 90 days at the time of purchase the principal objectives of our investment policy are the preservation of principal and maintenance of liquidity we intend to maintain a highly liquid portfolio by investing only in those marketable securities that we believe have active secondary or resale markets we believe our cash equivalents and shortterm investments are liquid and accessible we operate in some countries that have restrictive regulations over the movement of cash andor foreign exchange across their borders however these restrictions have not impeded our ability to conduct our business nor do we expect them to in the next 12 months we are not aware of any downgrades losses or other significant deterioration in the fair 

value of our cash equivalents or shortterm investments and accordingly we do not believe the fair value of our shortterm investments has significantly changed from the values reported as of june 28 2013 

cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and restricted cash and investments 



our cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and restricted cash and investments increased from june 29 2012 as a result of net cash provided by operating activities and the proceeds from the issuance of 1 billion of our 475 notes due 2023 these cash inflows were partially offset by our repurchases of our ordinary shares capital expenditures redemption and repurchase of certain of our longterm debt and dividends paid to our shareholders 

the following table summarizes results from the statement of cash flows for the periods indicated 



cash provided by operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2013 was approximately 30 billion and includes the effects of net income adjusted for noncash items including depreciation amortization stockbased compensation and 

• a decrease of 661 million in accounts receivable net primarily due to a decrease in revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 compared to the prior year period • a decrease of 538 million in accounts payable primarily due to a reduction in direct materials purchases due to a decrease in build volume in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 compared to the prior year period • a decrease of 272 million in vendor nontrade receivables primarily due to a decrease in build volumes in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 compared to the prior year period • a decrease of 170 million in accrued expenses income taxes and warranty primarily due to decreases in costs related to sales activities resulting from lower sales volumes and • a decrease of 102 million in inventory due to lower volumes in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 compared to the prior year period 52 

cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2012 was approximately 33 billion and includes the effects of net income adjusted for noncash items including depreciation amortization stockbased compensation and 

• an increase of 824 million in accounts receivable net due to an increase in revenues • an increase of 157 million in accounts payable due to higher direct material purchases related to an increase in volume partially offset by a change in supplier payment terms and • an increase of 145 million in accrued employee compensation reflecting an increase in variable performancebased compensation cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2011 was approximately 13 billion and includes the effects of net income adjusted for noncash items including depreciation amortization stockbased compensation impairment of longlived assets and 

• an increase of 386 million in accounts payable due to higher direct material purchases related to an increase in volume • an increase of 168 million related to an increase in vendor nontrade receivables and • an increase of 115 million in inventories related to an increase in volume cash used in investing activities 

in fiscal year 2013 we used 08 billion for net cash investing activities which was primarily due to payments for property equipment and leasehold improvements 

in fiscal year 2012 we used 11 billion for net cash investing activities which was primarily due to payments for property equipment and leasehold improvements of approximately 06 billion and net payments for the acquisition of samsungs hdd business of 06 billion 

in fiscal year 2011 we used 10 billion for net cash investing activities which was primarily attributable to payments for property equipment and leasehold improvements of approximately 08 billion 

cash provided by used in financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities of 22 billion for fiscal year 2013 was attributable to 17 billion paid to repurchase 54 million of our ordinary shares 12 billion for the repurchase and redemption of long term debt and 05 billion in dividends paid to our shareholders this use of cash was partially offset by the proceeds from the issuance of 1 billion of our 475 notes due 2023 and 03 billion in proceeds from the issuance of ordinary shares under employee stock plans 

net cash used in financing activities of 31 billion for fiscal year 2012 was attributable to 24 billion paid to repurchase 101 million of our ordinary shares 07 billion in long term debt repayments and 04 billion in dividends paid to our shareholders this use of cash was partially offset by 03 billion in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchases 

net cash provided by financing activities of 01 billion for fiscal year 2011 was attributable to 13 billion in net proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt partially offset by 08 billion to repurchase 569 million of our ordinary shares and 04 billion for the repayment of our longterm debt 

liquidity sources 

our primary sources of liquidity as of june 28 2013 consisted of 1 approximately 22 billion in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments 2 cash we expect to generate from operations and 3 a 500 million revolving credit facility we also had 101 million in restricted cash and investments of which 79 million was related to our employee deferred compensation liabilities under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan 

as of june 28 2013 no borrowings have been drawn under the revolving credit facility and 2 million had been utilized for letters of credit the line of credit is available for borrowings subject to compliance with financial covenants and other customary conditions to borrowing 

the credit agreement that governs our revolving credit facility as amended contains certain covenants that we must satisfy in order to remain in compliance with the credit agreement as amended the agreement also includes three financial covenants 1 minimum cash cash equivalents and marketable securities 2 a fixed charge coverage ratio and 3 a net leverage ratio as of june 28 2013 we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our revolving credit facility and debt agreements 

as of june 28 2013 cash and cash equivalents held by nonirish subsidiaries was 17 billion this amount is potentially subject to taxation in ireland upon repatriation by means of a dividend into our irish parent however it is our intent to indefinitely reinvest earnings of nonirish subsidiaries outside of ireland and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate such earnings by means of a taxable irish dividend should funds be needed in the irish parent company and should we be unable to fund parent company activities through means other than a taxable irish dividend we would be required to accrue and pay irish taxes on such dividend 

we believe that our sources of cash will be sufficient to fund our operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months 

cash requirements and commitments 

our liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital research and development and capital expenditure needs to fund scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness and to fund our dividend our ability to fund these requirements will depend on our future cash flows which are determined by future operating performance and therefore subject to prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and financial business and other factors some of which are beyond our control 

on july 24 2013 our board of directors approved a cash dividend of 038 per share which will be payable on august 21 2013 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on august 7 2013 

as of june 28 2013 we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our debt agreements based on our current outlook we expect to be in compliance with the covenants of our debt agreements over the next 12 months 

the carrying value of our longterm debt as of june 28 2013 and june 29 2012 was 28 billion and 29 billion respectively the table below presents the principal amounts of our outstanding longterm debt 



during fiscal year 2013 we repurchased approximately 54 million of our ordinary shares see item 5 market for registrants shares related shareholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securitiesrepurchases of our equity securities 

for fiscal year 2014 we expect capital investments to remain within our longterm targeted range of 68 of revenue we require substantial amounts of cash to fund scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness future capital expenditures and any increased working capital requirements we will continue to evaluate and manage the retirement and replacement of existing debt and associated obligations including evaluating the issuance of new debt securities exchanging existing debt securities for other debt securities and retiring debt pursuant to privately negotiated transactions open market purchases or otherwise in addition we may selectively pursue strategic alliances acquisitions and investments which may require additional capital 

contractual obligations and commitments 

our contractual cash obligations and commitments as of june 28 2013 have been summarized in the table below 



1 includes total future minimum rent expense under noncancelable leases for both occupied and vacated facilities rent expense is shown net of sublease income 

2 purchase obligations are defined as contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services which are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms 

as of june 28 2013 we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits and an accrual for the payment of related interest totaling 87 million none of which is expected to be settled within one year outside of one year we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlement with a taxing authority will occur 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of june 28 2013 we did not have any material offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of regulation sk 

critical accounting policies 

the methods estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements the sec has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are highly uncertain at the time of estimation based on this definition our most critical policies include establishment of sales program accruals establishment of warranty accruals accounting for income taxes and the accounting for goodwill and other longlived assets below we discuss these policies further as well as the estimates and judgments involved we also have other accounting policies and accounting estimates relating to uncollectible customer accounts valuation of inventory valuation of sharebased payments and restructuring we believe that these other accounting policies and accounting estimates either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective or it is less likely that they would have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period 

establishment of sales program accruals we establish certain distributor and oem sales programs aimed at increasing customer demand for oem sales rebates are typically based on an oem customers volume of purchases or other agreed upon rebate programs for the distribution channel these programs typically involve rebates related to a distributors level of sales order size advertising or point of sale activity and price protection adjustments we provide for these obligations at the time that revenue is recorded based on estimated requirements we estimate these contrarevenue rebates and adjustments based on various factors including price reductions during the period reported estimated future price erosion customer orders distributor sellthrough and inventory levels program participation customer claim submittals and sales returns our estimates reflect contractual arrangements but also our judgment relating to variables such as customer claim rates and attainment of program goals and inventory and sellthrough levels reported by our distribution customers currently our distributors inventories are at the low end of the historical range 

while we believe we have sufficient experience and knowledge of the market and customer buying patterns to reasonably estimate such rebates and adjustments actual market conditions or customer behavior could differ from our expectations as a result actual payments under these programs which may spread over several months after the related sale may vary from the amount accrued accordingly revenues and margins in the period in which the adjustment occurs may be affected 

significant actual variations in any of the factors upon which we base our contrarevenue estimates could have a material effect on our operating results in fiscal year 2013 sales programs were approximately 9 of gross revenue for fiscal years 2012 and 2011 total sales programs ranged from 2 to 9 of gross revenues adjustments to revenues due to under or over accruals for sales programs related to revenues reported in prior quarterly periods averaged 03 of quarterly gross revenue for fiscal years 2011 through 2012 and were approximately 03 of gross revenue in fiscal year 2013 any future shifts in the 

industry supplydemand balance as well as other factors may result in a more competitive pricing environment and may cause sales programs as a percentage of gross revenue to increase from the current or historical levels if such rebates and incentives trend upwards revenues and margins will be reduced 

establishment of warranty accruals we estimate probable product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized we generally warrant our products for a period of 1 to 5 years our warranty provision considers estimated product failure rates and trends including the timing of product returns during the warranty periods and estimated repair or replacement costs related to product quality issues if any we also exercise judgment in estimating our ability to sell certain repaired disk drives should actual experience in any future period differ significantly from our estimates our future results of operations could be materially affected our judgment is subject to a greater degree of subjectivity with respect to newly introduced products because of limited experience with those products upon which to base our warranty estimates 

the actual results with regard to warranty expenditures could have an adverse or favorable effect on our results of operations if the actual rate of unit failure the cost to repair a unit or the actual cost required to satisfy customer claims differs from those estimates we used in determining the warranty accrual since we typically outsource our warranty repairs our repair cost is subject to periodic negotiations with vendors and may vary from our estimates we also exercise judgment in estimating our ability to sell certain repaired disk drives to the extent such sales fall below our forecast warranty cost will be adversely impacted 

we review our warranty accrual quarterly for products shipped in prior periods and which are still under warranty any changes in the estimates underlying the accrual may result in adjustments that impact the current period gross margins and income in fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 net changes in estimates of prior warranty accruals as a percentage of revenue were immaterial our total warranty cost was 16 15 and 18 of revenue during fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively while warranty cost related to new shipments exclusive of the impact of reestimates of preexisting liabilities were 13 11 and 18 respectively for the same periods changes in anticipated failure rates of specific products and significant changes in repair or replacement costs have historically been the major reasons for significant changes in prior estimates any future changes in failure rates of certain products as well as changes in repair costs or the cost of replacement parts may result in increased or decreased warranty accruals 

accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes pursuant to accounting standards codification asc topic 740 asc 740 income taxes in applying asc 740 we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits recognition of income and deductions and calculation of specific tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions the calculation of tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the internal revenue service or other tax jurisdictions if estimates of these tax liabilities are greater or less than actual results an additional tax benefit or provision will result the deferred tax assets we record each period depend primarily on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states and certain nonus jurisdictions each period we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and if necessary we adjust the valuation allowance so that net deferred tax assets are recorded only to the extent we conclude it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized if our outlook for future taxable income changes significantly our assessment of the need for a valuation allowance may also change 

assessing goodwill and other longlived assets for impairment we account for goodwill in accordance with asc 350 intangibles—goodwill and other  as permitted by asc 350 we perform a qualitative assessment in determining whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying 

amount based on the qualitative assessment if it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then the company is not required to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test 

in accordance with asc 360054 impairment or disposal of longlived assets we test other longlived assets including property equipment and leasehold improvements and other intangible assets subject to amortization for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of those assets may not be recoverable we assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using the same approaches indicated above for asc 360 step two and compare it to its carrying value the excess of the carrying value over the fair value is allocated pro rata to derive the adjusted carrying value of each asset in the asset group the adjusted carrying value of each asset in the asset group is not reduced below its fair value

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we have exposure to market risks due to the volatility of interest rates foreign currency exchange rates equity and bond markets a portion of these risks are hedged but fluctuations could impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows additionally we have exposure to downgrades in the credit ratings of our counterparties as well as exposure related to our credit rating changes 

interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio as of june 28 2013 the company had no material availableforsale securities that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for a period greater than 12 months the company determined no material availableforsale securities were otherthantemporarily impaired as of june 28 2013 we currently do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 

we have fixed rate debt obligations we enter into debt obligations for general corporate purposes including capital expenditures and working capital needs we currently do not use interest rate derivatives to hedge interest rate exposure on our outstanding debt 

the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio and debt obligations as of june 28 2013 all shortterm investments mature in four years or less 

fiscal years ended 



foreign currency exchange risk we may enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposure related to certain foreign currency commitments and anticipated foreign currency denominated expenditures our policy prohibits us from entering into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes during fiscal years 2013 and 2012 we did not enter into any hedges of net investments in foreign operations 

we also hedge a portion of our foreign currency denominated balance sheet positions with foreign currency forward exchange contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings will be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates the changes in fair value of these hedges are recognized in earnings in the same period as the gains and losses from the remeasurement of the assets and liabilities these foreign currency forward exchange contracts are not designated as hedging instruments under asc 815 derivatives and hedging all these forward contracts mature within 12 months 

we evaluate hedging effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively and record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in costs of revenue on the consolidated statements of operations we did not have any material net gains losses recognized in costs of revenue for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness or discontinued cash flow hedges during fiscal years 2013 and 2012 

the table below provides information as of june 28 2013 about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts the table is provided in us dollar equivalent amounts and presents the notional 

amounts at the contract exchange rates and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates 



1 equivalent to the unrealized net gain loss on existing contracts 

other market risks we have exposure to counterparty credit downgrades in the form of credit risk related to our foreign currency forward exchange contracts and our fixed income portfolio we monitor and limit our credit exposure for our foreign currency forward exchange contracts by performing ongoing credit evaluations we also manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with any one counterparty and we maintain limits on maximum tenor of contracts based on the credit rating of the financial institutions additionally the investment portfolio is diversified and structured to minimize credit risk as of june 28 2013 we had not have any counterparty credit exposure related to our foreign currency forward exchange contracts changes in our corporate issuer credit ratings have minimal impact on our financial results but downgrades may negatively impact our future transaction costs and our ability to execute transactions with various counterparties 

we are subject to equity market risks due to changes in the fair value of the notional investments selected by our employees as part of our seagate deferred compensation plan the sdcp and on certain strategic investments in equity of publicly traded companies we currently manage our exposure to equity market risks associated with the sdcp liabilities by investing directly in mutual funds that mirror the employees investment options 

as of june 28 2013 we continued to hold auction rate securities with a par value of approximately 17 million all of which are collateralized by student loans guaranteed by the federal family education loan program beginning in the march 2008 quarter these securities have continuously failed to settle at auction as of june 28 2013 the estimated fair value of these auction rate securities was 15 million we believe that the impairments totaling 2 million are temporary as we do not intend to sell these securities and have concluded it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the securities before the recovery of the amortized cost basis as such the impairment was recorded in other comprehensive income loss and these securities were classified as longterm investments

industry overview 

electronic data storage industry 

the electronic data storage industry is comprised of companies that manufacture components or subcomponents designed for electronic data storage devices and companies that provide storage solutions through a variety of technologies such as disk drives and semiconductorbased storage technologies such as flash memory 

demand for electronic data storage 

technological advances in storage technology and a proliferation of content rich devices such as media tablets dvrs gaming consoles digital music players and digital cameras are driving the broad global proliferation and growth of digital content through the 

• creation and sharing of all types of digital content such as highresolution photos high definition video and movies and music by consumers and electronic data by enterprises • aggregation and distribution of digital content through services and other offerings such as youtube facebook netflix pandora itunes hulu and linkedin • network and video infrastructure  including broadband internet protocol television iptv cable and satellite that has enabled the access hosting and distribution of such digital content • enjoyment and consumption of digital content through dvrs handheld devices tablets smart phones and gaming consoles as well as in automobiles and • protection of digital content through storage on backup devices and storage services as a result of these factors the nature and amount of content being created requires increasingly higher storage capacity in order to store manage distribute utilize and backup such content this in turn has resulted in the rapid growth in demand for electronic data storage applications and solutions which we believe will continue to grow with the increased demand for electronic data storage in developed countries as well as in emerging economies 

we believe that demand for electronic data storage in the enterprise and traditional compute markets continues to grow as the proliferation of digital content in the consumer space has resulted in additional 

demand for storage by enterprises including those that host aggregate distribute or share such content other factors driving demand for additional storage include 

• continued growth in cloud computing and backup services for enterprises seeking efficient and costeffective methods of processing and storing mass data increases demand for storage as data centers expand and proliferate • increasing legal and regulatory requirements which necessitate larger archives and • changes in the nature and amount of data being stored such as the growing use of digital records in the health care industry demand trends for disk drives 

we believe that continued growth in digital content requires increasingly higher storage capacity in order to store aggregate host distribute manage backup and use such content which we believe will continue to result in increased demand for disk drive products in addition we believe the continued increased demand for electronic data storage in developed countries as well as in emerging economies reflects the demand for realtime access to rich data and content driven by the impact of a highly mobile and increasingly connected user base we believe these trends will continue as computing architectures evolve to serve the growing commercial and consumer user base throughout the world 

we believe that in the foreseeable future the traditional enterprise and client compute markets that require high capacity storage solutions as well as the data intensive client noncompute markets will continue to be best served by hard disk drives based on the industrys ability to deliver cost effective reliable and energy efficient mass storage devices furthermore the increased use of client noncompute devices that consume media rich content streamed from the cloud increases the demand for high capacity disk drives in nearline applications 

industry supply balance 

from time to time the industry has experienced periods of imbalance between supply and demand to the extent that the disk drive industry builds capacity based on expectations of demand that do not materialize price erosion may become more pronounced conversely during periods where demand exceeds supply price erosion is generally muted 

in early october 2011 floodwaters north of bangkok thailand inundated many manufacturing industrial parks that contained a number of the factories supporting the hdd industrys supply chain the hdd industry had concentrated a large portion of its supply chain participants within these industrial parks in an effort to reduce cost and improve logistics as a result the inundation of floodwaters into these industrial parks had caused the closure or suspension of production by a number of participants within the hdd supply chain 

during the supply chain disruption in fiscal year 2012 we believe demand exceeded supply due to the impact from the flooding in thailand resulting in an increase in the average selling price asp the industrys ability to manufacture and ship drives has continued to recover through the end of the fiscal year and we believe total shipments in the industry were approximately 600 million units compared to 657 million units during fiscal year 2011 as of june 29 2012 we believe that the hdd industrys component supply chain has substantially recovered 

markets 

the principal markets served by the disk drive industry are 

enterprise storage we define enterprise storage as those solutions which are designed for mission critical and nearline applications 

mission critical applications are defined as those that are vital to the operation of enterprises requiring high performance and high reliability solutions we expect the market for mission critical enterprise storage solutions to continue to be driven by enterprises moving network traffic to dedicated storage area networks in an effort to reduce network complexity and increase energy savings we believe that this transition will lead to an increased demand for more energy efficient smaller form factor solutions these solutions are comprised principally of high performance enterprise class disk drives with sophisticated firmware and communications technologies 

solid state drive ssd storage applications have been introduced as a potential alternative to redundant system startup or boot disk drives in addition enterprises are gradually adopting ssds in applications where rapid processing andor energy efficiency is required the timing of significant adoption of ssds is dependent on enterprises weighing the cost effectiveness and other benefits of mission critical enterprise disk drives against the perceived performance benefits of ssds 

nearline applications are defined as those which require high capacity and energy efficient solutions featuring low costs per gigabyte we expect such applications which include storage for cloud computing content delivery and backup services will continue to grow and drive demand for solutions designed with these attributes with the increased consumption of media rich content streamed from the cloud we expect increased petabyte demand for high capacity nearline devices 

client compute we define client compute applications as solutions designed for desktop and mobile compute applications we believe that the increase in demand resulting from growing economies of certain countries and the continued proliferation of digital content will continue to drive growing demand for the client compute market as the storage of digital content in the cloud becomes more prominent some client compute applications may require less builtin storage and therefore ssds could become more competitive within the client compute market in the future ssds could become more competitive within the client compute market in the future as mobile compute applications transition to smaller and thinner form factors 

client noncompute we define client noncompute applications as solutions designed for consumer electronic devices and disk drives used for external storage and networkattached storage nas disk drives designed for consumer electronic devices are primarily used in applications such as dvrs and gaming consoles that require a higher capacity low costpergigabyte storage solution disk drives for external and nas devices are designed for purposes such as personal data backup and portable external storage and to augment storage capacity in the consumers current desktop notebook tablet or dvr disk drive capacities client noncompute applications also include devices designed to display digital media in the home theater we believe the proliferation and personal creation of high definition and mediarich digital content will continue to create increasing consumer demand for higher storage solutions

our business 

disk drive technology 

the design and manufacturing of disk drives depends on highly advanced technology and manufacturing techniques and therefore requires high levels of research and development spending and capital equipment investments manufacturing our disk drives is a complex process that begins with the production of individual components and ends with a fully assembled disk drive we design fabricate and assemble a number of the most important components found in our disk drives including readwrite heads and recording media our design and manufacturing operations are based on technology platforms that are used to produce various disk drive products that serve multiple data storage applications and markets our core technology platforms are focused around the areal density of media and readwrite head technologies using an integrated platform design and manufacturing leverage approach allows us to deliver a portfolio of disk drive products to service a wide range of electronic data storage applications and a wide range of industries 

disk drives that we manufacture are commonly differentiated by the following key characteristics 

• storage capacity commonly expressed in gigabytes gb or terabytes tb which is the amount of data that can be stored on the disk drive • spindle rotation speed commonly expressed in revolutions per minute rpm which has an effect on speed of access to data • interface transfer rate commonly expressed in megabytes per second which is the rate at which data moves between the disk drive and the computer controller • average seek time commonly expressed in milliseconds which is the time needed to position the heads over a selected track on the disk surface • data transfer rate commonly expressed in megabytes per second which is the rate at which data is transferred to and from the disk drive • product quality and reliability commonly expressed in annualized return rates and • energy efficiency commonly measured by the power output necessary to operate the disk drive areal density is a measure of storage capacity per square inch on the recording surface of a disk the storage capacity of a disk drive is determined by the number of disks it contains as well as the areal density capability of these disks we have been pursuing and will continue to pursue a number of technologies to increase areal densities across the entire range of our products for expanding disk drive capacities and reducing the number of disks and heads per drive to further reduce product costs 

manufacturing 

vertically integrated hard drive manufacturers design and produce their own readwrite heads and recording media which are critical technologies for disk drives this integrated approach enables manufacturers to lower costs and to improve the functionality of components so that they work together efficiently 

we believe that because of our vertical design and manufacturing strategy we are well suited to meet the challenges posed by the close interdependence of components for disk drives our manufacturing 

efficiency and flexibility are critical elements of our integrated business strategy we continuously seek to improve our manufacturing efficiency and cost by 

• employing manufacturing automation to enhance our efficiency • improving product quality and reliability and reducing costs • integrating our supply chain with suppliers and customers to enhance our demand visibility and reduce our working capital requirements • coordinating between our manufacturing group and our research and development organization to rapidly achieve volume manufacturing and • leveraging the facilities we operate and the personnel we employ a vertically integrated model however tends to have less flexibility when demand moderates as it exposes us to higher unit costs as capacity utilization is not optimized 

due to the significant challenges posed by the need to continually innovate and improve manufacturing efficiency and the continued demands on capital and research and development investments required to do so the disk drive industry has undergone significant consolidation as disk drive manufacturers and component manufacturers merged with other companies or exited the industry 

components and raw materials 

disk drives incorporate certain components including a head disk assembly and a printed circuit board mounted to the head disk assembly which are sealed inside a rigid base and top cover containing the recording components in a contamination controlled environment we maintain a highly integrated approach to our business by designing and manufacturing a significant portion of the components we view as critical to our products such as recording heads and media 

readwrite heads the function of the readwrite head is to scan across the disk as it spins magnetically recording or reading information the tolerances of recording heads are extremely demanding and require stateoftheart equipment and processes our readwrite heads are manufactured with thinfilm and photolithographic processes similar to those used to produce semiconductor integrated circuits though challenges in magnetic film properties and topographical structures are unique to the disk drive industry we perform all primary stages of design and manufacture of readwrite heads at our facilities we use a combination of internally manufactured and externally sourced readwrite heads the mix of which varies based on product mix technology and our internal capacity levels 

media information is written to the media or disk as it rotates at very high speeds past the readwrite head the media is made from nonmagnetic material usually aluminum alloy or glass and is coated with a thin layer of magnetic material we use a combination of internally manufactured and externally sourced finished media and aluminum substrates the mix of which varies based on product mix technology and our internal capacity levels we purchase all of our glass substrates from third parties which we use in the disk drives we make for mobile products 

printed circuit board assemblies the printed circuit board assemblies pcbas are comprised of standard and custom asics and ancillary electronic control chips the asics control the movement of data to and from the readwrite heads and through the internal controller and interface which communicates with the host computer the asics and control chips form electronic circuitry that delivers instructions to a head positioning mechanism called an actuator to guide the heads to the selected track of a disk where the data is recorded or retrieved disk drive manufacturers use one or more industry standard interfaces such as serial advanced technology architecture sata small computer system interface scsi serial attached scsi sas or fibre channel fc to communicate to the host systems we 

outsource to third parties the manufacture and assembly of the pcbas used in our disk drives we do not manufacture any asics but we participate in their proprietary design 

head disk assembly the head disk assembly consists of one or more disks attached to a spindle assembly powered by a spindle motor that rotates the disks at a high constant speed around a hub readwrite heads mounted on an arm assembly similar in concept to that of a record player fly extremely close to each disk surface and record data on and retrieve it from concentric tracks in the magnetic layers of the rotating disks the readwrite heads are mounted vertically on an eshaped assembly eblock that is actuated by a voicecoil motor to allow the heads to move from track to track the eblock and the recording media are mounted inside the head disk assembly we purchase spindle motors from outside vendors and from time to time participate in the design of the motors that go into our products we use a combination of internally manufactured and externally sourced head disk assemblies 

disk drive assembly following the completion of the head disk assembly it is mated to the pcba and the completed unit goes through extensive defect mapping and testing prior to packaging and shipment disk drive assembly and test operations occur primarily at facilities located in china and thailand we perform subassembly and component manufacturing operations at our facilities in china malaysia northern ireland singapore thailand and in the united states in minnesota in addition third parties manufacture and assemble components and disk drive assemblies for us in various countries worldwide 

suppliers of components and industry constraints there are a limited number of independent suppliers of components such as recording heads and media available to disk drive manufacturers vertically integrated disk drive manufacturers who manufacture their own components are less dependent on external component suppliers than less vertically integrated disk drive manufacturers in fiscal year 2012 the industry experienced significant increases in the cost of components due to the severe flooding in thailand 

commodity and other manufacturing costs the production of disk drives requires rare earth elements precious metals scarce alloys and industrial commodities which are subject to fluctuations in prices and the supply of which has at times been constrained for example during the latter part of fiscal year 2011 and continuing into fiscal year 2012 the industry experienced significant increases in the costs of rare earth elements which are used in magnets as well as in the process for polishing glass substrates in addition to increased costs of components and commodities volatility in fuel costs may also increase our costs related to commodities manufacturing and freight as a result we may increase our use of ocean shipments to help offset any increase in freight costs

customers 

we sell our products to major oems distributors and retailers 

the following table summarizes our revenue by channel and by geography 



oem customers typically enter into master purchase agreements with us these agreements provide for pricing volume discounts order lead times product support obligations and other terms and conditions the term of these agreements is usually 12 to 24 months deliveries are scheduled only after receipt of purchase orders in addition with limited leadtime customers may defer most purchase orders without significant penalty anticipated orders from many of our customers have in the past failed to materialize or oem delivery schedules have been deferred or altered as a result of changes in their business needs 

our distributors generally enter into nonexclusive agreements for the resale of our products they typically furnish us with a nonbinding indication of their nearterm requirements and product deliveries are generally scheduled accordingly the agreements and related sales programs typically provide the distributors with limited right of return and price protection rights in addition we offer sales programs to distributors on a quarterly and periodic basis to promote the sale of selected products in the sales channel 

our retail channel consists of our branded storage products sold to retailers either by us directly or by our distributors retail sales made by us or our distributors typically require greater marketing support sales incentives and price protection periods 

in fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 dell inc accounted for approximately 15 13 and 11 of consolidated revenue respectively while hewlettpackard company accounted for approximately 14 15 and 16 of consolidated revenue respectively see item 1a risk factors—risks related to our business—dependence on key customers—we may be adversely affected by the loss of or reduced delayed or canceled purchases by one or more of our larger customers 

competition 

the markets that we compete in are intensely competitive disk drive manufacturers not only compete for a limited number of major disk drive customers but also compete with other companies in the electronic data storage industry that provide alternative storage solutions such as flash memory and ssds some of the principal factors used by customers to differentiate among electronic data storage solutions manufacturers are storage capacity price per unit and price per gigabyte storageretrieval access times data transfer rates product quality and reliability supply continuity form factor warranty and brand we believe that our disk drive products are competitive with respect to each of these factors in the markets that we currently address 

principal disk drive competitors we have experienced and expect to continue to experience intense competition from other disk drive manufacturers after the industry consolidation experienced during fiscal year 2012 in which we acquired certain assets that comprised the hdd business of samsung electronics co ltd and western digital corporation acquired viviti technologies ltd formerly hitachi global storage technologies our primary competitors are western digital corporation and toshiba corporation 

other competitors we also are experiencing competition from companies that provide alternative storage technologies such as flash memory and ssds used both in lower capacity hand held devices and for rapid processing and high volume transactions 

price erosion our industry has been characterized by price declines for disk drive products with comparable capacity performance and feature sets likeforlike products price declines for likeforlike products price erosion are more pronounced during periods of 

• economic contraction or industry consolidation in which competitors may use discounted pricing to attempt to maintain or gain market share • few new product introductions when competitors have comparable or alternative product offerings and • industry supply exceeding demand disk drive manufacturers typically attempt to offset price erosion with an improved mix of disk drive products characterized by higher capacity better performance and additional feature sets andor product cost reductions 

product life cycles and changing technology success in our industry has been dependent to a large extent on the ability to be the firsttomarket with new products to market in high volume with quality attributes that our customers expect before our competitors generally allowing those disk drive manufacturers who introduce new products first to benefit from improved product mix favorable profit margins and less pricing pressure until comparable products are introduced also because our industry is characterized by continuous price erosion being firsttomarket has necessitated quick achievement of product cost effectiveness changing technology also necessitates ongoing investments in research and development which may be difficult to recover due to rapid product life cycles and economic declines further there is a continued need to successfully execute product transitions and new product introductions as factors such as quality reliability and manufacturing yields become of increasing competitive importance 

disk drive industry consolidation due to the significant challenges posed by the need to continually innovate and improve manufacturing efficiency and the continued demands on capital and research and development investments required to do so the disk drive industry has undergone significant consolidation as disk drive manufacturers and component manufacturers merged with other companies or exited the industry we acquired samsung electronics co ltds hard disk drive business in december of 2011 and western digital purchased viviti technologies ltd formerly hitachi global storage technologies in march of 2012 additionally we may in the future face indirect competition from customers who from time to time evaluate whether to offer electronic data storage products that may compete with our products 

seasonality 

the disk drive industry traditionally experiences seasonal variability in demand with higher levels of demand in the second half of the calendar year this seasonality is driven by consumer spending in the backtoschool season from late summer to fall and the traditional holiday shopping season from fall to winter in addition corporate demand is typically higher during the second half of the calendar year 

research and development 

we are committed to developing new component technologies products and alternative storage technologies our research and development focus is designed to bring new products to market in high volume with quality attributes that our customers expect before our competitors part of our product development strategy is to leverage a design platform andor subsystem within product families to serve different market needs this platform strategy allows for more efficient resource utilization leverages best design practices reduces exposure to changes in demand and allows for achievement of lower costs through purchasing economies our advanced technology integration effort focuses disk drive and component research on recording subsystems including readwrite heads and recording media marketspecific product technology and technology focused towards new business opportunities the primary purpose of our advanced technology integration effort is to ensure timely availability of mature component technologies to our product development teams as well as allowing us to leverage and coordinate those technologies in the design centers across our products in order to take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace during fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 we had product development expenses of approximately 1006 million 875 million and 877 million respectively which represented 7 8 and 8 of our consolidated revenue respectively 

patents and licenses 

as of june 29 2012 we had 5323 us patents and 1866 patents issued in various foreign jurisdictions as well as 1275 us and 1156 foreign patent applications pending the number of patents and patent applications will vary at any given time as part of our ongoing patent portfolio management activity due to the rapid technological change that characterizes the electronic data storage industry we believe that in addition to patent protection the improvement of existing products reliance upon trade secrets protection of unpatented proprietary knowhow and development of new products are also important to our business in establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage accordingly we intend to continue our efforts to broadly protect our intellectual property including obtaining patents where available in connection with our research and development program 

the electronic data storage industry is characterized by significant litigation relating to patent and other intellectual property rights because of rapid technological development in the electronic data storage industry some of our products have been and in the future could be alleged to infringe existing patents of third parties from time to time we receive claims that our products infringe patents of third parties although we have been able to resolve some of those claims or potential claims by obtaining licenses or rights under the patents in question without a material adverse affect on us other claims have resulted in adverse decisions or settlements in addition other claims are pending which if resolved unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations for more information on these claims see item 8 financial statements and supplementary datanote 14 legal environmental and other contingencies the costs of engaging in intellectual property litigation in the past have been and in the future may be substantial irrespective of the merits of the claim or the outcome we have patent licenses with a number of companies additionally as part of our normal intellectual property practices we may be engaged in negotiations with other major electronic data storage companies and component manufacturers with respect to patent licenses 

backlog 

in view of industry practice whereby customers may cancel or defer orders with little or no penalty we believe backlog in the disk drive industry is of limited indicative value in estimating future performance and results 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to us and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites some of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution and these permits are subject to modification renewal and revocation by issuing authorities 

we have established environmental management systems and continually update environmental policies and standard operating procedures for our operations worldwide we believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws regulations and permits we budget for operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental laws if additional or more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future we could incur additional operating costs and capital expenditures 

some environmental laws such as the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended the superfund law and its state equivalents can impose liability for the cost of cleanup of contaminated sites upon any of the current or former site owners or operators or upon parties who sent waste to these sites regardless of whether the owner or operator owned the site at the time of the release of hazardous substances or the lawfulness of the original disposal activity we have been identified as a potentially responsible party at several sites at each of these sites we have an assigned portion of the financial liability based on the type and amount of hazardous substances disposed of by each party at the site and the number of financially viable parties we have fulfilled our responsibilities at some of these sites and remains involved in only a few at this time 

while our ultimate costs in connection with these sites is difficult to predict with complete accuracy based our current estimates of cleanup costs and its expected allocation of these costs we do not expect costs in connection with these sites to be material 

we may be subject to various state federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment including those restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products for example the european union eu enacted the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment which prohibits the use of certain substances including lead in certain products including disk drives put on the market after july 1 2006 similar legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions including in the united states canada mexico taiwan china japan and others the european union reach directive registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals ec 19072006 also restricts substances of very high concern svhcs in products if we or our suppliers fail to comply with the substance restrictions recycle requirements or other environmental requirements as they are enacted worldwide it could have a materially adverse effect on our business 

employees 

at june 29 2012 we employed approximately 57900 employees temporary employees and contractors worldwide of which approximately 50600 employees were located in our asian operations we believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees at all levels we believe that our employee relations are good

 item 1a risk factors 

risks related to our business 

macroeconomic conditions—changes in the macroeconomic environment have and may continue to negatively impact our results of operations 

due to the continuing uncertainty about current macroeconomic conditions we believe our customers may postpone spending in response to tighter credit unemployment negative financial news andor declines in income or asset values which could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products other factors that could influence demand include conditions in the residential real estate and mortgage markets labor and healthcare costs access to credit consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior these and other economic factors could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and on our financial condition and operating results 

competition—our industry is highly competitive and our products have experienced and will continue to experience significant price erosion and market share variability 

the disk drive industry is intensely competitive and vendors typically experience substantial price erosion over the life of a product our competitors have historically offered existing products at lower prices as part of a strategy to gain or retain market share and customers and we expect these practices to continue we will need to continually reduce our prices for existing products to retain our market share which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we believe price erosion and market share variability will continue as the industry engages in aggressive pricing actions targeted to shift customer demand to offset lower demand due to the deterioration in business and economic conditions 

our ability to offset the effect of price erosion through new product introductions at higher average prices is diminished to the extent competitors introduce products into particular markets ahead of our similar competing products our ability to offset the effect of price erosion is also diminished during times when product life cycles for particular products are extended allowing competitors more time to enter the market 

sales to distributors that serve producers of nonbranded products in the personal storage sector may also contribute to increased price erosion these customers generally have limited product qualification programs which increases the number of competing products available to satisfy their demand as a result purchasing decisions for these customers are based largely on price and terms any increase in our average price erosion would have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

additionally a significant portion of our success in the past has been a result of increasing our market share at the expense of our competitors particularly in enterprise markets market share for our products can be negatively affected by our customers diversifying their sources of supply as our competitors enter the market for particular products as well as by our ability to ramp volume production of new product offerings when our competitors successfully introduce product offerings that are competitive with our recently introduced products our customers may quickly diversify their sources of supply any significant decline in our market share in any of our principal market applications would adversely affect our results of operations 

principal competitors—we compete with both an independent manufacturer whose primary focus is producing technologically advanced disk drives and a captive manufacturer who does not depend solely on sales of disk drives to maintain its profitability 

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience intense competition from an independent disk drive manufacturer and a captive manufacturer the term independent in this context refers to manufacturers that primarily produce disk drives as a standalone product such as western digital corporation and the term captive in this context refers to a manufacturer who through affiliated entities produces complete computer or other systems that contain disk drives or other electronic data storage products such as toshiba corporation 

the captive manufacturer is a formidable competitor because it has the ability to determine pricing for complete systems without regard to the margins on individual components as components other than disk drives generally contribute a greater portion of the operating margin on a complete computer system than do disk drives the captive manufacturer does not necessarily need to realize a profit on the disk drives included in a complete computer system and as a result may be willing to sell disk drives to third parties at very low margins the captive manufacturer is also a formidable competitor because it has more substantial resources than we do to the extent we are not successful competing with the captive or independent disk drive manufacturers our results of operations will be adversely affected 

in response to customer demand for highquality highvolume and lowcost disk drives manufacturers of disk drives have had to develop large and in some cases global production facilities with highly developed technological capabilities and internal controls the development of these large production facilities combined with industry consolidation can further increase the intensity of competition 

we also face indirect competition from present and potential customers who evaluate from time to time whether to manufacture their own disk drives or other electronic data storage products 

we also experience competition from other companies that produce alternative storage technologies like flash memory where increasing capacity decreasing cost energy efficiency and improvements in performance ruggedness have resulted in competition with our lower capacity smaller form factor disk drives while this competition has traditionally been in the markets for handheld consumer electronics applications these competitors have announced solid state drives ssds for tablet notebook and enterprise compute applications certain customers for both notebook and enterprise compute applications are evaluating and may adopt ssds as alternatives to hard drives in certain applications 

volatility of quarterly results—our quarterly results of operations fluctuate sometimes significantly from period to period and may cause our share price to decline 

in the past our quarterly revenue and results of operations have fluctuated sometimes significantly from period to period these fluctuations which we expect to continue may be occasioned by a variety of factors including 

• current uncertainty in global economic conditions may pose a risk to the overall economy • adverse changes in the level of economic activity in the major regions in which we do business • competitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices by our competitors targeted to encourage shifting of customer demand • delays or problems in our introduction of new products particularly new disk drives with lower cost structures the inability to achieve high production yields or delays in customer qualification or initial product quality issues • changes in purchasing patterns by our distributor customers 20 

• increased costs or adverse changes in availability of supplies of raw materials or components • the impact of corporate restructuring activities that we have and may continue to engage in • changes in the demand for the computer systems storage subsystems and consumer electronics that contain our disk drives due to seasonality economic conditions and other factors • changes in purchases from period to period by our primary customers particularly as our competitors are able to introduce and produce in volume competing disk drive solutions or alternative storage technology solutions such as flash memory or ssds • shifting trends in customer demand which when combined with overproduction of particular products particularly when the industry is served by multiple suppliers results in unfavorable supplydemand imbalances • our high proportion of fixed costs including research and development expenses • announcements of new products services or technological innovations by us or our competitors and • adverse changes in the performance of our products as a result we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our revenue and results of operations may not be meaningful and that these comparisons may not be an accurate indicator of our future performance our results of operations in one or more future quarters may fail to meet the expectations of investment research analysts or investors which could cause an immediate and significant decline in the trading price of our ordinary shares 

difficulty in predicting quarterly demand—if we fail to predict demand accurately for our products in any quarter we may not be able to recapture the cost of our investments 

the disk drive industry operates on quarterly purchasing cycles with much of the order flow in any given quarter typically coming at the end of that quarter our manufacturing process requires us to make significant productspecific investments in inventory in each quarter for that quarters production since we typically receive the bulk of our orders late in a quarter after we have made our investments there is a risk that our orders will not be sufficient to allow us to recapture the costs of our investment before the products resulting from that investment have become obsolete we cannot assure you that we will be able to accurately predict demand in the future 

the difficulty in forecasting demand also increases the difficulty in anticipating our inventory requirements which may cause us to overproduce finished goods resulting in inventory writeoffs or underproduce finished goods affecting our ability to meet customer requirements additionally the risk of inventory writeoffs could increase if we were to continue to hold higher inventory levels we cannot be certain that we will be able to recover the costs associated with increased inventory 

other factors that may negatively impact our ability to recapture the cost of investments in any given quarter include 

• the impact of variable demand and an aggressive pricing environment for disk drives • the impact of competitive product announcements and possible excess industry supply both with respect to particular disk drive products and with respect to competing alternative storage technology solutions such as ssds in tablet notebook and enterprise compute applications • our inability to reduce our fixed costs to match sales in any quarter because of our vertical manufacturing strategy which means that we make more capital investments than we would if we were not vertically integrated 21 

• dependence on our ability to successfully qualify manufacture and sell in increasing volumes on a costeffective basis and with acceptable quality our disk drive products particularly the new disk drive products with lower cost structures • variations in the cost of components for our products especially during periods when the us dollar is relatively volatile as compared to other currencies • uncertainty in the amount of purchases from our distributor customers who from time to time constitute a large portion of our total sales • our product mix and the related margins of the various products • accelerated reduction in the price of our disk drives due to technological advances andor an oversupply of disk drives in the market and shifting trends in demand which can create supply and demand imbalances • manufacturing delays or interruptions particularly at our manufacturing facilities in china malaysia northern ireland singapore thailand or the united states • limited access to components that we obtain from a single or a limited number of suppliers • the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the cost of producing our products and the effective price of our products to foreign consumers and • operational issues arising out of the increasingly automated nature of our manufacturing processes new product offerings—market acceptance of new product introductions cannot be accurately predicted and our results of operations will suffer if there is less demand for our new products than is anticipated 

we are continually developing new products with the goal that we will be able to introduce technologically advanced and lower cost disk drives into the marketplace ahead of our competitors 

the success of our new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors including market acceptance our ability to manage the risks associated with product transitions the effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand and the risk that our new products will have quality problems or other defects in the early stages of introduction that were not anticipated in the design of those products accordingly we cannot accurately determine the ultimate effect that our new products will have on our results of operations 

in addition the success of our new product introductions is dependent upon our ability to qualify as a primary source of supply with our oem customers in order for our products to be considered by our customers for qualification we must be among the leaders in timetomarket with those new products once a product is accepted for qualification testing any failure or delay in the qualification process or a requirement that we requalify can result in our losing sales to that customer until new products are introduced the limited number of highvolume oems magnifies the effect of missing a product qualification opportunity these risks are further magnified because we expect competitive pressures to result in declining sales eroding prices and declining gross margins on our current generation products we cannot assure that we will be among the leaders in timetomarket with new products or that we will be able to successfully qualify new products with our customers in the future 

if we cannot successfully deliver competitive products our future results of operations may be adversely affected 

smaller form factor products—if we do not continue to successfully market smaller form factor products our business may suffer 

the disk drive industry is experiencing significant increases in sales of smaller form factor disk drives or other electronic data storage technologies for an expanding number of applications in particular notebook computers and consumer electronic devices but also in personal computers and enterprise storage applications our future success will depend on our ability to develop and introduce smaller form factor products at desired price and capacity points faster than our competitors 

we have experienced competition from other companies that produce alternative storage technologies like solid state or flash memory where increased capacity improving cost energy efficiency and performance ruggedness have resulted in flash memory largely replacing disk drives in handheld applications we believe that the demand for disk drives to store or back up related media content from such handheld devices however continues to grow while this competition has traditionally been limited to the markets for handheld consumer electronics applications these competitors have announced ssds for tablet notebook and enterprise compute applications 

if we do not suitably adapt our product offerings to successfully introduce additional smaller form factor disk drives or alternative storage products based on flash storage technology or if our competitors are successful in achieving customer acceptance of ssd products for tablet notebook and enterprise compute applications then our customers may decrease the amounts of our products that they purchase which would adversely affect our results of operations 

dependence on supply of components equipment and raw materials—if we experience shortages or delays in the receipt of or cost increases in critical components equipment or raw materials necessary to manufacture our products we may suffer lower operating margins production delays and other material adverse effects 

the cost quality and supply of components certain equipment and raw materials used to manufacture disk drives and key components like recording media and heads are critical to our success the equipment we use to manufacture our products and components is frequently custom made and comes from a few suppliers and the lead times required to obtain manufacturing equipment can be significant particularly important components for disk drives include readwrite heads aluminum or glass substrates for recording media asics spindle motors printed circuit boards and suspension assemblies we rely on sole suppliers or a limited number of suppliers for some of these components that we do not manufacture including aluminum and glass substrates readwrite heads asics spindle motors printed circuit boards and suspension assemblies many of such component suppliers are geographically concentrated in particular in thailand which makes our supply chain more vulnerable to regional disruptions such as the recent flooding in thailand which has had a material impact on the production and availability of many components if our vendors for these components are unable to meet our cost quality and supply requirements we could experience a shortage in supply or an increase in production costs which would adversely affect our results of operations 

certain rare earth elements are critical in the manufacture of our products we purchase components that contain rare earth elements from a number of countries including the peoples republic of china we cannot predict whether any nation will impose regulations quotas or embargoes upon the rare earth elements incorporated into our products that would restrict the worldwide supply of such metals or increase their cost we have experienced increased costs and production delays when we were unable to obtain the necessary equipment or sufficient quantities of some components andor have been forced to pay higher prices or make volume purchase commitments or advance deposits for some components equipment or raw materials that were in short supply in the industry in general if any major supplier were to restrict the supply available to us or increase the cost of the rare earth elements used in our products we could experience a shortage in supply or an increase in production costs which would adversely affect our results of operations 

consolidation among component manufacturers may result in some component manufacturers exiting the industry or not making sufficient investments in research to develop new components 

if there is a shortage of or delay in supplying us with critical components equipment or raw materials then 

• it is likely that our suppliers would raise their prices and if we could not pass these price increases to our customers our operating margin would decline • we might have to reengineer some products which would likely cause production and shipment delays make the reengineered products more costly and provide us with a lower rate of return on these products • we would likely have to allocate the components we receive to certain of our products and ship less of others which could reduce our revenues and could cause us to lose sales to customers who could purchase more of their required products from manufacturers that either did not experience these shortages or delays or that made different allocations and • we might be late in shipping products causing potential customers to make purchases from our competitors thus causing our revenue and operating margin to decline we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain critical components in a timely and economic manner 

importance of timetomaturity—our results of operations may depend on our being among the firsttomaturity with new product offerings and achieving sufficient production volume with our new products 

to achieve consistent success with our oem customers it is important that we be an early provider of new types of disk drives featuring leading highquality technology and lower per gigabyte storage cost historically our results of operations have substantially depended upon our ability to be among the firsttomaturity with new product offerings our market share and results of operations in the future may be adversely affected if we fail to 

• consistently maintain our timetomaturity performance with our new products • produce these products in sufficient volume • qualify these products with key customers on a timely basis by meeting our customers performance and quality specifications or • achieve acceptable manufacturing yields quality and costs with these products if the delivery of our products is delayed our oem customers may use our competitors products to meet their production requirements if the delay of our products causes delivery of those oems computer systems into which our products are integrated to be delayed consumers and businesses may purchase comparable products from the oems competitors 

we face the related risk that consumers and businesses may wait to make their purchases if they want to buy a new product that has been shipped or announced but not yet released if this were to occur we may be unable to sell our existing inventory of products that may be less efficient and cost effective compared to new products as a result even if we are among the firsttomaturity with a given product subsequent introductions or announcements by our competitors of new products could cause us to lose revenue and not achieve a positive return on our investment in existing products and inventory 

industry demand—poor global economic conditions and changes in demand for computer systems and storage subsystems may cause in the future a decline in demand for our products 

our disk drives are components in computers computer systems storage subsystems and consumer electronics devices the demand for these products has been volatile during times of poor global economic conditions consumer spending tends to decline and retail demand for personal computers and consumer electronics devices tends to decrease as does enterprise demand for computer systems and storage subsystems moreover unexpected slowdowns in demand for computer systems storage subsystems or consumer electronics devices generally cause sharp declines in demand for disk drive products the decline in consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services and on our financial condition and results of operations 

additional causes of declines in demand for our products in the past have included announcements or introductions of major new operating systems or semiconductor improvements or changes in consumer preferences such as the shift from desktop to notebook computers we believe these announcements and introductions have from time to time caused consumers to defer their purchases and made inventory obsolete whenever an oversupply of disk drives causes participants in our industry to have higher than anticipated inventory levels we experience even more intense price competition from other disk drive manufacturers than usual 

dependence on distributors—we are dependent on sales to distributors and retailers which may increase price erosion and the volatility of our sales 

a substantial portion of our sales has been to distributors of disk drive products certain of our distributors may also market other products that compete with our products product qualification programs in this distribution channel are limited which increases the number of competing products that are available to satisfy demand particularly in times of lengthening product cycles as a result purchasing decisions in this channel are based largely on price terms and product availability sales volumes through this channel are also less predictable and subject to greater volatility than sales to our oem customers in addition deterioration in business and economic conditions could exacerbate price erosion and volatility as distributors lower prices to compensate for lower demand and higher inventory levels our distributors ability to access credit for purposes of funding their operations may also affect purchases of our products by these customers 

if distributors reduce their purchases of our products or prices decline significantly in the distribution channel or if distributors experience financial difficulties or terminate their relationships with us our revenues and results of operations would be adversely affected 

dependence on key customers—we may be adversely affected by the loss of or reduced delayed or cancelled purchases by one or more of our larger customers 

some of our key customers including hewlettpackard company and dell inc account for a large portion of our disk drive revenue while we have longstanding relationships with many of our customers if any of our key customers were to significantly reduce their purchases from us our results of operations would be adversely affected while sales to major customers may vary from period to period a major customer that permanently discontinues or significantly reduces its relationship with us could be difficult to replace in line with industry practice new customers usually require that we pass a lengthy and rigorous qualification process at the customers cost accordingly it may be difficult or costly for us to attract new major customers additionally mergers acquisitions consolidations or other significant transactions involving our customers generally entail risks to our business if a significant transaction involving any of our key customers results in the loss of or reduction in purchases by these key customers it could have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and prospects 

dependence on sales of disk drives in client noncompute applications—our sales of disk drives for client noncompute applications which have contributed significant revenues to our results can experience significant volatility due to seasonal and other factors which could materially adversely impact our future results of operations 

sales of disk drives for client noncompute applications have contributed significant revenues to our results consumer spending on client noncompute has and may continue to deteriorate in many countries and regions due to poor global economic conditions and high levels of unemployment this could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services and on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition the demand for client noncompute products can be even more volatile and unpredictable than the demand for client compute products in some cases our products manufactured for client noncompute applications are uniquely configured for a single customers application which creates a risk of unwanted and unsellable inventory if the anticipated volumes are not realized this potential for unpredictable volatility is increased by the possibility of competing alternative storage technologies like flash memory meeting the customers cost and capacity metrics resulting in a rapid shift in demand from our products and disk drive technology generally to alternative storage technologies unpredictable fluctuations in demand for our products or rapid shifts in demand from our products to alternative storage technologies in new client noncompute applications could materially adversely impact our future results of operations 

dependence on sales of disk drives directly to consumers through retail outlets—our sales of disk drives directly to consumers through retail outlets can experience significant volatility due to seasonal and other factors which could materially adversely impact our future results of operations 

we believe that industry demand for storage products in the longterm is increasing due to the proliferation of mediarich digital content in consumer applications and is fueling increased consumer demand for storage this has led to the expansion of solutions such as external storage products to provide additional storage capacity and to secure data in case of disaster or system failure or to provide independent storage solutions for multiple users in home or small business environments consumer spending on retail sales of our branded solutions has deteriorated in some markets and may continue to do so if poor global economic conditions continue and higher levels of unemployment persist this could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services and on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition such retail sales of our branded solutions traditionally experience seasonal variability in demand with higher levels of demand in the first half of our fiscal year driven by consumer spending in the backtoschool season from late summer to fall and the traditional holiday shopping season from fall to winter additionally our ability to reach such consumers depends on our maintaining effective working relationships with major retailers and distributors failure to anticipate consumer demand for our branded solutions as well as an inability to maintain effective working relationships with retail and online distributors may adversely impact our future results of operations 

importance of controlling operating costs—if we do not control our operating expenses we will not be able to compete effectively in our industry 

our strategy involves to a substantial degree increasing revenue and product volume while at the same time controlling operating expenses if we do not control our operating expenses our ability to compete in the marketplace may be impaired in the past activities to reduce operating costs have included closures and transfers of facilities significant personnel reductions and efforts to increase automation the reduction of personnel and closure of facilities may adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in required volumes to meet customer demand and may result in other disruptions that affect our products and customer service 

impairment charges—we may be required to record additional impairment charges for goodwill andor other longlived assets 

we are required to assess goodwill annually for impairment or on an interim basis whenever events occur or circumstances change such as an adverse change in business climate or a decline in the overall industry that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount we are also required to test other longlived assets including acquired intangible assets and property equipment and leasehold improvements for recoverability and impairment whenever there are indicators of impairment such as an adverse change in business climate 

adverse changes in business conditions could materially impact our estimates of future operations and result in impairment charges to our goodwill or other long lived assets if our goodwill or other longlived assets were to become impaired our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

impact of technological change—increases in the areal density of disk drives may outpace customers demand for storage capacity 

the rate of increase in areal density or storage capacity per square inch on a disk may be greater than the increase in our customers demand for aggregate storage capacity particularly in certain market applications like client compute as a result our customers storage capacity needs may be satisfied with lower priced low capacity disk drives these factors could decrease our sales especially when combined with continued price erosion which could adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in electronic data storage products—future changes in the nature of electronic data storage products may reduce demand for traditional disk drive products 

we expect that in the future new personal computing devices and products will be developed some of which such as internet appliances tablet or mobile phones with advanced capabilities or smartphones may not contain a disk drive while we are investing development resources in designing disk drives for these new applications these new applications may have an impact on future demand for disk drive products products using alternative technologies such as flash memory and other storage technologies are becoming increasingly common and could become a significant source of competition to particular applications of our products which could adversely affect our results of operations 

new product development and technological change—if we do not develop products in time to keep pace with technological changes our results of operations will be adversely affected 

our customers have demanded new generations of disk drive products as advances in computer hardware and software have created the need for improved storage products with features such as increased storage capacity improved performance and reliability and lower cost we and our competitors have developed improved products and we will need to continue to do so in the future such product development requires significant investments in research and development we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully complete the design or introduction of new products in a timely manner that we will be able to manufacture new products in sufficient volumes with acceptable manufacturing yields that we will be able to successfully market these new products or that these products will perform to specifications on a longterm basis in addition the impact of slowing areal density growth may adversely impact our ability to be successful 

when we develop new products with higher capacity and more advanced technology our results of operations may decline because the increased difficulty and complexity associated with producing these products increases the likelihood of reliability quality or operability problems if our products suffer increases in failures are of low quality or are not reliable customers may reduce their purchases of our products and our manufacturing rework and scrap costs and service and warranty costs may increase in 

addition a decline in the reliability of our products may make us less competitive as compared with other disk drive manufacturers or competing technologies 

substantial leverage—our substantial leverage may place us at a competitive disadvantage in our industry 

we are leveraged and have significant debt service obligations our significant debt and debt service requirements could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities for example our high level of debt presents the following risks 

• we are required to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements • our substantial leverage increases our vulnerability to economic downturns and adverse competitive and industry conditions and could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that are less leveraged • our debt service obligations could limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry and could limit our ability to pursue other business opportunities borrow more money for operations or capital in the future and implement our business strategies • our level of debt may restrict us from raising additional financing on satisfactory terms to fund working capital capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements and • covenants in our debt instruments limit our ability to pay future dividends or make other restricted payments and investments in the event that we need to refinance all or a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures we may not be able to obtain terms as favorable as the terms of our existing debt or refinance our existing debt at all if prevailing interest rates or other factors existing at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing then the interest expense relating to the refinanced debt would increase furthermore if any rating agency changes our credit rating or outlook our debt and equity securities could be negatively affected which could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt or raise additional capital 

significant debt service requirements—servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate cash may be affected by factors beyond our control 

our business may not generate cash flow in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay the principal of or interest on our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs including working capital capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements 

our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control we cannot assure you that 

• our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations • we will continue to realize the cost savings revenue growth and operating improvements that result from the execution of our longterm strategic plan or • future sources of funding will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs 28 

if we cannot fund our liquidity needs we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements we cannot assure you that any of these remedies could if necessary be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all or that they would permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations in addition if we incur additional debt the risks associated with our substantial leverage including the risk that we will be unable to service our debt or generate enough cash flow to fund our liquidity needs could intensify 

restrictions imposed by debt covenants—restrictions imposed by our senior secured revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our 10 senior secured secondpriority notes due 2014 may limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in our interest 

our senior secured revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our 10 senior secured secondpriority notes due 2014 the 10 notes impose and the terms of any future debt may impose operating and other restrictions on us subject to qualifications and exceptions our senior secured revolving credit facility and such indenture limit among other things our ability to 

• incur additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred shares • create liens • pay dividends or make distributions in respect of our capital stock • redeem or repurchase capital stock or debt • make certain investments or other restricted payments • sell assets • issue or sell capital stock of subsidiaries • enter into transactions with affiliates • engage to any material extent in business other than our current business and • effect a consolidation or merger the credit agreement that governs our senior secured revolving credit facility contains certain covenants that we must satisfy in order to remain in compliance with the credit agreement including three financial covenants 1 minimum cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments 2 a fixed charge coverage ratio and 3 a net leverage ratio a breach of any of the covenants in our debt agreements including our inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our senior secured revolving credit facility if a condition of default occurs and we are not able to obtain a waiver from the lenders holding a majority of the commitments under our senior secured revolving credit facility the administrative agent of our senior secured revolving credit facility may and at the request of lenders holding a majority of the commitments shall declare all of our outstanding obligations under our senior secured revolving credit facility together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable and may terminate the lenders commitments thereunder cease making further loans and if we cannot repay our outstanding obligation institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets if our outstanding indebtedness were to be accelerated we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full that debt and any potential future indebtedness which would cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline significantly we could also be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 

in addition some of the agreements governing our other debt instruments contain crossdefault provisions that may be triggered by a default under our senior secured revolving credit facility in the event that we default under our senior secured revolving credit facility there could be an event of default under crossdefault provisions for the applicable debt instrument as a result all outstanding obligations under 

certain of our debt instruments may become immediately due and payable if such acceleration were to occur we may not have adequate funds to satisfy all of our outstanding obligations the lenders could exercise their rights as described above and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 

substantially all of our assets are pledged as collateral to secure certain indebtedness—since substantially all of our assets are used to secure portions of our existing debt obligations we may be limited in our ability to incur additional indebtedness or to provide additional credit support and if we fail to meet our payment or other obligations under certain of our existing debt obligations the lenders thereunder could foreclose on and acquire control of substantially all of our assets 

substantially all our assets and the assets of our significant subsidiaries organized in the united states the cayman islands the netherlands northern ireland and singapore as well as certain assets located in the united states the cayman islands the netherlands northern ireland and singapore owned by other significant subsidiaries and all proceeds therefrom are pledged as security for borrowings under our 10 notes as well as obligations under our hedging agreements cash management arrangements and certain metal leasing arrangements since substantially all of our assets are used to secure portions of our existing debt obligations we have a limited amount of collateral that is available for future secured debt or credit support as a result we may be limited in our ability to incur additional indebtedness or to provide additional credit support for our existing indebtedness in addition our failure to comply with the terms of the indenture governing our 10 notes would entitle the lenders thereunder to declare all funds borrowed thereunder to be immediately due and payable if we were unable to meet these payment obligations the lenders could foreclose on and acquire control of substantially all our assets that serve as collateral 

failure to pay quarterly dividends—our failure to pay quarterly dividends to our shareholders could cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline significantly 

our ability to pay quarterly dividends will be subject to among other things our financial position and results of operations available cash and cash flow capital requirements and other factors any reduction or discontinuation of quarterly dividends could cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline significantly moreover in the event our payment of quarterly dividends is reduced or discontinued our failure or inability to resume paying dividends at historical levels could result in a persistently low market valuation of our ordinary shares 

purchase commitments to certain suppliers—if revenues fall or customer demand decreases significantly we may not meet all of our purchase commitments to certain suppliers 

from time to time we enter into longterm noncancelable purchase commitments with certain suppliers in order to secure certain components for the production of our products or to supplement our internal manufacturing capacity for certain components if our actual revenues in the future are lower than our projections or if customer demand decreases significantly below our projections we may not meet all of our purchase commitments with these suppliers as a result it is possible that we will have to shift output from our internal manufacturing facilities to these suppliers or make penaltytype payments under these contracts 

risks associated with future strategic alliances joint ventures or investments—we may not be able to identify suitable strategic alliances acquisitions joint ventures or investment opportunities or successfully acquire and integrate companies that provide complementary products or technologies 

our growth strategy may involve pursuing strategic alliances with making acquisitions of forming joint ventures with or making investments in other companies that are complementary to our business there is substantial competition for attractive strategic alliance acquisition joint venture and investment candidates accordingly we may not be able to identify suitable strategic alliances acquisition joint venture or investment candidates even if we can identify them we cannot assure you that we will be able 

to partner with acquire or invest in suitable candidates or integrate acquired technologies or operations successfully into our existing technologies and operations moreover our ability to finance potential strategic alliances acquisitions joint ventures or investments will be limited by our high degree of leverage the covenants contained in the indentures that govern our outstanding indebtedness and any agreements governing any other debt we may incur 

if we are successful in forming strategic alliances or acquiring forming joint ventures or making investments in other companies any of these transactions may have an adverse effect on our results of operations particularly while the operations of an acquired business are being integrated it is also likely that integration of acquired companies would lead to the loss of key employees from those companies or the loss of customers of those companies in addition the integration of any acquired companies would require substantial attention from our senior management which may limit the amount of time available to be devoted to our daytoday operations or to the execution of our strategy growth by strategic alliance acquisition joint venture or investment involves an even higher degree of risk to the extent we combine new product offerings and enter new markets in which we have limited experience and no assurance can be given that acquisitions of entities with new or alternative business models will be successfully integrated or achieve their stated objectives 

furthermore the expansion of our business involves the risk that we might not manage our growth effectively that we would incur additional debt to finance these acquisitions or investments that we may have impairment of goodwill or acquired intangible assets associated with these acquisitions and that we would incur substantial charges relating to the writeoff of inprocess research and development similar to that which we incurred in connection with several of our prior acquisitions each of these items could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we could issue additional ordinary shares in connection with future strategic alliances acquisitions joint ventures or investments issuing shares in connection with such transactions would have the effect of diluting your ownership percentage of the ordinary shares and could cause the price of our ordinary shares to decline 

risk of intellectual property litigation—our products may infringe the intellectual property rights of others which may cause us to incur unexpected costs or prevent us from selling our products 

we cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of others we may not be aware of currently filed patent applications that relate to our products or technology if patents are later issued on these applications we may be liable for infringement we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims including claims of alleged infringement of the patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties by us or our customers in connection with their use of our products 

we are currently subject to lawsuits involving intellectual property claims which could cause us to incur significant additional costs or prevent us from selling our products and which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

intellectual property litigation is expensive and timeconsuming regardless of the merits of any claim and could divert our managements attention from operating our business in addition intellectual property lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties due to the complexity of the technical issues involved and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in defending ourselves against intellectual property claims patent litigation has increased due to the current uncertainty of the law and the increasing competition and overlap of product functionality in the field if we were to discover that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of others we would need to obtain licenses from these parties or substantially reengineer our products in order to avoid infringement we might not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms or at all or be able to reengineer our products successfully 

moreover if we are sued for patent infringement and lose the suit we could be required to pay substantial damages andor be enjoined from using or selling the infringing products or technology any of the foregoing could cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling our products which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition see part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary datanote 14 legal environmental and other contingencies of this annual report on form 10k for a description of pending intellectual property proceedings 

cyber attacks system failures and breaches—we could suffer a loss of revenue and increased costs exposure to significant liability reputational harm and other serious negative consequences if we sustain cyber attacks or other data security breaches that disrupt our operations or result in the dissemination of proprietary or confidential information about us or our customers or other thirdparties 

our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer equipment and the electronic data stored in our databases from damage by among other things earthquake fire natural disasters accidents power disruptions telecommunications failures acts of terrorism or war employee misconduct physical or electronic breakins or similar events or disruptions we manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our operations in addition our outsourcing services and cloud computing businesses routinely process store and transmit large amounts of data for our customers and vendors including sensitive and personally identifiable information as our operations become more automated and increasingly interdependent our exposure to the risks posed by these types of events will increase we may also be subject to breaches of the information technology systems we use for these purposes information technology system failures and network disruptions experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of thirdparties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products in addition sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from thirdparties may contain defects in design or manufacture including bugs and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system 

the costs to us to eliminate or address the foregoing security problems and security vulnerabilities before or after a cyber incident could be significant system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions we could lose existing or potential customers for outsourcing services or other information technology solutions in connection with any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products in addition breaches of our security measures and the unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers or other thirdparties could expose us our vendors and customers or other thirdparties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business in addition we rely in certain limited capacities on thirdparty data management providers whose possible security problems and security vulnerabilities may have similar effects on us 

we are subject to laws rules and regulations in the us and other countries relating to the collection use and security of user data our ability to execute transactions and to possess and use personal information and data in conducting our business subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens that may require us to notify vendors customers or employees of a data security breach we have incurred and will continue to incur significant expenses to comply with mandatory privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law regulation industry standards or contractual obligations 

economic risks associated with international operations—our international operations subject us to risks related to currency exchange fluctuations longer payment cycles for sales in foreign countries seasonality and disruptions in foreign markets tariffs and duties price controls potential adverse tax consequences increased costs our customers credit and access to capital and healthrelated risks 

we have significant operations in foreign countries including manufacturing facilities sales personnel and customer support operations we have manufacturing facilities in china malaysia northern ireland singapore and thailand in addition to those in the united states a substantial portion of our client compute disk drive assembly occurs in our facility in china 

our international operations are subject to economic risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries including the following 

• disruptions in foreign markets disruptions in financial markets and the deterioration of the underlying economic conditions in the past in some countries including those in asia have had an impact on our sales to customers located in or whose enduser customers are located in these countries • fluctuations in currency exchange rates prices for our products are denominated predominately in us dollars even when sold to customers that are located outside the united states currency instability in asia and other geographic markets may make our products more expensive than products sold by other manufacturers that are priced in the local currency moreover many of the costs associated with our operations located outside the united states are denominated in local currencies as a consequence the increased strength of local currencies against the us dollar in countries where we have foreign operations would result in higher effective operating costs and potentially reduced earnings from time to time fluctuations in foreign exchange rates have negatively affected our operations and profitability and there can be no assurance that these fluctuations will not adversely affect our operations and profitability in the future • longer payment cycles our customers outside of the united states are often allowed longer time periods for payment than our us customers this increases the risk of nonpayment due to the possibility that the financial condition of particular customers may worsen during the course of the payment period • seasonality seasonal reductions in the business activities of our customers during the summer months particularly in europe typically result in lower earnings during those periods • tariffs duties limitations on trade and price controls our international operations are affected by limitations on imports currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations price controls and other restraints on trade in addition the governments of many countries including china malaysia northern ireland singapore and thailand in which we have significant operating assets have exercised and continue to exercise significant influence over many aspects of their domestic economies and international trade • potential adverse tax consequences our international operations create a risk of potential adverse tax consequences including imposition of withholding or other taxes on payments by subsidiaries • increased costs the shipping and transportation costs associated with our international operations are typically higher than those associated with our us operations resulting in decreased operating margins in some foreign countries • credit and access to capital risks our international customers could have reduced access to working capital due to higher interest rates reduced bank lending resulting from contractions in the money supply or the deterioration in the customers or its banks financial condition or the inability to access other financing 33 

• global health outbreaks the occurrence of a pandemic disease may adversely impact our operations and some of our key customers such diseases could also potentially disrupt the timeliness and reliability of the distribution network we rely on political risks associated with international operations—our international operations subject us to risks related to political unrest and terrorism 

we have manufacturing facilities in parts of the world that periodically experience political unrest this could disrupt our ability to manufacture important components as well as cause interruptions andor delays in our ability to ship components to other locations for continued manufacture and assembly any such delays or interruptions could result in delays in our ability to fill orders and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition us and international responses to the ongoing hostilities in various regions and the risk of terrorist attacks or hostilities elsewhere in the world could exacerbate these risks 

legal and operational risks associated with international operations—our international operations subject us to risks related to staffing and management legal and regulatory requirements and the protection of intellectual property 

operating outside of the united states creates difficulties associated with staffing and managing our international manufacturing facilities complying with local legal and regulatory requirements and protecting our intellectual property we cannot assure you that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with applicable customs currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which we may be subject we also cannot assure you that these laws will not be modified 

dependence on key personnel—the loss of key executive officers and employees could negatively impact our business prospects 

our future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued service of key members of management as well as marketing sales and product development personnel the loss of one or more of our key personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we believe our future success will also depend in large part upon our ability to attract retain and further motivate highly skilled management marketing sales and product development personnel we have experienced intense competition for personnel and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our key employees or that we will be successful in attracting assimilating and retaining personnel in the future 

securities litigation—significant fluctuations in the market price of our ordinary shares could result in securities class action claims against us 

significant price and value fluctuations have occurred with respect to the publicly traded securities of disk drive companies and technology companies generally the price of our ordinary shares is likely to be volatile in the future in the past following periods of decline in the market price of a companys securities class action lawsuits have often been pursued against that company if similar litigation were pursued against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources which could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

global credit and financial market conditions—deterioration in global credit and financial market conditions could negatively impact the value of our current portfolio of cash equivalents shortterm investments or auction rate securities and our ability to meet our financing objectives 

our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase our shortterm investments consist primarily of readily marketable debt securities with remaining maturities of more than 90 days at the time of purchase our investment policy has as its principal objectives the preservation of principal and maintenance of liquidity we mitigate default risk by investing in highquality investment grade securities limiting the time to maturity and by monitoring the counterparties and underlying obligors closely 

while as of the date of this filing we are not aware of any other material downgrades losses or other significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or shortterm investments or auction rate securities since june 29 2012 no assurance can be given that further deterioration in conditions of the global credit and financial markets would not negatively impact our current portfolio of cash equivalents shortterm investments or auction rate securities or our ability to meet our financing objectives 

environmental regulations—failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the sale and manufacturing of products in certain states and countries may subject us to environmental and other regulations including in some instances the responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling for example the eu has enacted the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment directive which prohibits the use of certain substances in electronic equipment and the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive which obligates parties that place electrical and electronic equipment onto the market in the eu to put a clearly identifiable mark on the equipment register with and report to eu member countries regarding distribution of the equipment and provide a mechanism to takeback and properly dispose of the equipment similar legislation may be enacted in other locations where we manufacture or sell our products although we do not anticipate any material adverse effects based on the nature of our operations and the focus of such legislation we will need to ensure that we comply with these laws and regulations as they are enacted and that our suppliers also comply with these laws and regulations if we fail to timely comply with the legislation our customers may refuse to purchase our products which would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition if we were found to be in violation of these laws or noncompliance with these initiatives or standards of conduct we could be subject to governmental fines liability to our customers and damage to our reputation which would also have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

seasonality—because we experience seasonality in the sales of our products our results of operations will generally be adversely impacted during the second half of our fiscal year 

sales of computer systems storage subsystems and consumer electronics tend to be seasonal and therefore we expect to continue to experience seasonality in our business as we respond to variations in our customers demand for disk drives in particular we anticipate that sales of our products will continue to be lower during the second half of our fiscal year in the client compute and client noncompute market applications of our business this seasonality is partially attributable to the historical trend in our results derived from our customers increased sales of desktop computers notebook computers and consumer electronics during the backtoschool and winter holiday season in the enterprise market our sales are seasonal because of the capital budgeting and purchasing cycles of our end users since our working capital needs peak during periods in which we are increasing production in anticipation of orders that have not yet been received our results of operations will fluctuate seasonally even if the forecasted demand for our products proves accurate furthermore it is difficult for us to evaluate the degree to which this seasonality may affect our business in future periods because of the rate and unpredictability of product transitions 

and new product introductions particularly in the client noncompute market as well as macroeconomic conditions 

volatile public markets—the price of our ordinary shares may be volatile and could decline significantly 

the stock market in general and the market for technology stocks in particular has recently experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of companies if these market or industrybased fluctuations continue the trading price of our ordinary shares could decline significantly independent of our actual operating performance and you could lose all or a substantial part of your investment the market price of our ordinary shares could fluctuate significantly in response to several factors including among others 

• general uncertainty in stock market conditions occasioned by global economic conditions negative financial news and the continued instability of several large financial institutions • actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations • announcements of innovations new products or significant price reductions by us or our competitors including those competitors who offer alternative storage technology solutions • our failure to meet the performance estimates of investment research analysts • the timing of announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts or acquisitions • general stock market conditions • the occurrence of major catastrophic events • changes in financial estimates by investment research analysts • changes in the credit ratings of our indebtedness by rating agencies and • the sale of our ordinary shares held by certain equity investors or members of management political events war terrorism natural disasters public health issues and other circumstances could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

war terrorism geopolitical uncertainties natural disasters public health issues and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy and thus could have a strong negative effect on our business our suppliers logistics providers manufacturing vendors and customers our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes fire power shortages terrorist attacks other hostile acts labor disputes public health issues and other events beyond our control such events could decrease demand for our products make it difficult or impossible for us to make and deliver products to our customers or to receive components from our suppliers and create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain in the event of a natural disaster losses and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations and our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected should major public health issues including pandemics arise we could be negatively affected by stringent employee travel restrictions additional limitations in freight services governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in our operations and some of our key customers recently the hard disk drive component supply chain has been significantly disrupted as a result of severe flooding in thailand but our component and drive assembly factories in thailand were not directly affected by the flood and continue to be fully operational the industrys ability to manufacture and ship drives has continued to recover through the end of the fiscal year and we believe total shipments in the industry were approximately 600 million units compared to 657 million units during fiscal year 2011 

if we do not realize the expected benefits of our strategic alignment with samsung our business and financial condition may be materially impaired 

we may not achieve the desired benefits from our strategic alignment with samsung if we cannot successfully integrate the business we acquired from samsung into our operations we may experience negative consequences to our business financial condition or results of operations 

even if we are able to successfully integrate the business that we acquired from samsung into our business we may not be able to realize the cost savings synergies and growth that we anticipate from this transaction in the timeframe we currently expect and the costs of achieving these benefits may be higher than we currently expect because of a number of risks including but not limited to 

• the possibility that the transaction may not further our business strategy as we expected • our operating results or financial condition may be adversely impacted by liabilities that we assume in the transaction and • the risk of intellectual property disputes with respect to the acquired assets in addition the chinese ministry of commerce conditioned its approval of the samsung acquisition on our compliance with several ongoing requirements including adopting measures to keep the samsung hdd brand as a separate competitor to the seagate hdd brand expanding the samsung hdd production capacity within six months of the decision and investing at least 800 million per year for three years in rd in our combined samsung and seagate hdd businesses compliance with these obligations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practices that result in reduced revenue noncompliance could result in extending the time under which we would be compelled to operate under these conditions 

as a result of these risks the transaction may not contribute to our earnings as we expected we may not achieve expected cost synergies when expected or at all and we may not achieve the other anticipated strategic and financial benefits of this transaction 

our ability to use our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards might be limited 

at june 29 2012 the use of approximately 346 million and 90 million of our us net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards respectively is subject to an aggregate annual limitation of 45 million pursuant to us tax law to the extent these net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are available we intend to use them to reduce the corporate income tax liability associated with our operations in the us section 382 of the us internal revenue code generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards that might be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone significant changes in ownership as a result future changes in ownership such as changes in ownership resulting from future repurchases of our ordinary shares could put limitations on the availability of our net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards if certain ownership changes occur in the foreseeable future there may be an additional annual limitation on our ability to use our total us federal and state net operating loss and credit carryforwards of 27 billion 18 billion and 363 million respectively if these ownership changes were to occur we estimate a onetime charge for additional us income tax expense of approximately 400 to 500 million may be recorded in the period such change occurs this additional income tax expense results from a decrease in our net us deferred tax assets recorded through a combination of the write off of deferred tax assets and associated changes to our valuation allowance we also estimate that the ensuing additional annual limitation on our ability to use tax attribute carryovers may result in increased us income tax expense associated with such change of approximately 50 to 75 million each year

we are a leading provider of electronic data storage products our principal products are hard disk drives commonly referred to as disk drives hard drives or hdds hard disk drives are devices that store digitally encoded data on rapidly rotating disks with magnetic surfaces disk drives continue to be the primary medium of mass data storage due to their performance attributes high quality cost effectiveness and energy efficiencies 

we produce a broad range of electronic data storage products addressing enterprise applications where our products are designed for enterprise servers mainframes and workstations client compute applications where our products are designed for desktop and notebook computers and client noncompute applications where our products are designed for a wide variety of end user devices such as digital video recorders dvrs gaming consoles personal data backup systems portable external storage systems and digital media systems in addition to manufacturing and selling disk drives we provide data storage services for small to mediumsized businesses including online backup data protection and recovery solutions 

business overview 

our industry is characterized by several trends and factors that have a material impact on our strategic planning financial condition and results of operations 

industry supply balance 

from time to time the industry has experienced periods of imbalance between supply and demand to the extent that the disk drive industry builds capacity based on expectations of demand that do not materialize price erosion may become more pronounced conversely during periods where demand exceeds supply price erosion is generally muted 

in early october 2011 floodwaters north of bangkok thailand inundated many manufacturing industrial parks that contained a number of the factories supporting the hdd industrys supply chain the hdd industry had concentrated a large portion of its supply chain participants within these industrial parks in an effort to reduce cost and improve logistics as a result the inundation of floodwaters into these industrial parks had caused the closure or suspension of production by a number of participants within the hdd supply chain 

during the supply chain disruption in fiscal year 2012 we believe demand exceeded supply due to the impact from the flooding in thailand resulting in an increase in the average selling price asp the industrys ability to manufacture and ship drives has continued to recover through the end of the fiscal year and we believe total shipments in the industry were approximately 600 million units compared to 

657 million units during fiscal year 2011 as of june 29 2012 we believe that the hdd industrys component supply chain has substantially recovered 

demand trends for disk drives 

we believe that continued growth in digital content requires increasingly higher storage capacity in order to store aggregate host distribute manage backup and use such content which we believe will continue to result in increased demand for disk drive products in addition we believe the continued increased demand for electronic data storage in developed countries as well as in emerging economies reflects the demand for realtime access to rich data and content driven by the impact of a highly mobile and increasingly connected user base we believe these trends will continue as computing architectures evolve to serve the growing commercial and consumer user base throughout the world 

we believe that in the foreseeable future the traditional enterprise and client compute markets that require high capacity storage solutions as well as the data intensive client noncompute markets will continue to be best served by hard disk drives based on the industrys ability to deliver cost effective reliable and energy efficient mass storage devices furthermore the increased use of client noncompute devices that consume media rich content streamed from the cloud increases the demand for high capacity disk drives in nearline applications 

price erosion our industry has been characterized by price declines for disk drive products with comparable capacity performance and feature sets likeforlike products price declines for likeforlike products price erosion are more pronounced during periods of 

• economic contraction or industry consolidation in which competitors may use discounted pricing to attempt to maintain or gain market share • few new product introductions when competitors have comparable or alternative product offerings and • industry supply exceeding demand disk drive manufacturers typically attempt to offset price erosion with an improved mix of disk drive products characterized by higher capacity better performance and additional feature sets andor product cost reductions 

seasonality 

the disk drive industry traditionally experiences seasonal variability in demand with higher levels of demand in the second half of the calendar year this seasonality is driven by consumer spending in the backtoschool season from late summer to fall and the traditional holiday shopping season from fall to winter in addition corporate demand is typically higher during the second half of the calendar year 

fiscal year 2012 summary 

revenues for fiscal year 2012 were 149 billion which represented a 36 increase in revenues from 110 billion in the prior fiscal year gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased to 31 from 20 in the prior fiscal year 

transaction with samsung 

on december 19 2011 we completed the acquisition of samsungs hdd business pursuant to an asset purchase agreement apa entered into on april 19 2011 by which the company acquired certain assets and liabilities of samsung relating to the research and development manufacture and sale of hdds the transaction and related agreements are expected to improve our position as a supplier of 25inch products position us to better address rapidly evolving opportunities in markets including but not limited 

to mobile computing cloud computing and solid state storage expand our customer access in china and southeast asia and accelerate time to market for new products 

the december 19 2011 acquisitiondate fair value of the consideration transferred to samsung totaled 11 billion which consisted of 452 million of our ordinary shares and 571 million in cash the operations of samsungs hdd business are included in our results from the date of acquisition 

results of operations 

the following table summarizes information from our consolidated statements of operations by dollars and as a percentage of revenue 



  



the following table summarizes information regarding volume shipments average selling prices asps and revenues by channel and geography 



fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011 

revenue 



revenue in fiscal year 2012 increased approximately 36 or 40 billion from fiscal year 2011 due primarily to an increase in average selling price per unit and in total units shipped units shipped in fiscal year 2012 increased 13 or 25 million units from fiscal year 2011 the increase in the average selling price to 66 per unit during fiscal year 2012 as compared to 54 per unit in the prior year was primarily due to the limited industry supply of hard drives resulting from the severe flooding in thailand 

gross margin 



for fiscal year 2012 gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased to 31 from 20 in the prior fiscal year primarily due to the increased selling price per unit throughout most of fiscal year 2012 

operating expenses 



product development expense product development expenses for fiscal year 2012 increased from fiscal year 2011 primarily reflecting an increase in variable performancebased compensation and the integration of the hdd business acquired from samsung 

marketing and administrative expense the increase in marketing and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011 was primarily due to an increase in variable performancebased compensation and integration of the hdd business acquired from samsung 

amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles for fiscal year 2012 increased as a result of the acquisition of certain intangible assets from samsungs hdd business 

restructuring and other net restructuring and other net for fiscal years 2012 and 2011 were not material and primarily related to previously announced restructuring plans 

other income expense net 



other expense net for fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011 was relatively flat and included an increase in interest expense resulting from higher average debt balances substantially offset by gains on foreign currency remeasurement 

income taxes 



we recorded an income tax provision of 20 million for fiscal year 2012 compared to an income tax provision of 68 million for fiscal year 2011 our fiscal year 2012 provision for income taxes included 35 million of income tax benefit from the reversal of a portion of the us valuation allowance recorded in prior periods our fiscal year 2011 provision for income taxes included nonus income taxes recorded for increases in income tax reserves for nonus income tax positions taken in prior fiscal years partially offset by tax benefits recorded for the release of income tax reserves associated with settlements of income tax audits and the expiration of certain statutes of limitation 

our irish tax resident parent holding company owns various us and nonus subsidiaries that operate in multiple nonirish tax jurisdictions our worldwide operating income is either subject to varying 

rates of tax or is exempt from tax due to tax holidays or tax incentive programs we operate under in malaysia singapore and thailand these tax holidays or incentives are scheduled to expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2020 

our income tax provision recorded for fiscal year 2012 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying the irish statutory rate of 25 to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i tax benefits related to nonus earnings generated in jurisdictions that are subject to tax holidays or tax incentive programs and are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of ireland and ii a decrease in valuation allowance for certain us deferred tax assets the acquisition of samsungs hdd business did not have a significant impact on our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2012 our income taxes provision recorded for the comparative fiscal year ended july 1 2011 differed the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying the irish statutory rate of 25 to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i tax benefits related to nonus earnings generated in jurisdictions that are subject to tax holidays or tax incentive programs and are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of ireland ii income tax expense related to intercompany transactions iii a decrease in valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets and iv nonus losses with no tax benefit 

based on our nonus ownership structure and subject to i potential future increases in our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and ii a future change in our intention to indefinitely reinvest earnings from our subsidiaries outside of ireland we anticipate that our effective tax rate in future periods will generally be less than the irish statutory rate 

at june 29 2012 our deferred tax asset valuation allowance was approximately 11 billion 

at june 29 2012 we had net deferred tax assets of 490 million the realization of these deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on our ability to generate sufficient us and certain nonus taxable income in future periods although realization is not assured we believe that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable however may increase or decrease in subsequent periods when we reevaluate the underlying basis for our estimates of future us and certain nonus taxable income 

at june 29 2012 the use of approximately 346 million and 90 million of our us net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards respectively is subject to an aggregate annual limitation of 45 million pursuant to us tax law if certain ownership changes occur in the foreseeable future there may be an additional annual limitation on our ability to use our total us federal and state net operating loss and credit carryforwards of 27 billion 18 billion and 363 million respectively it is reasonably possible that such a change could occur if these ownership changes were to occur we estimate a onetime charge for additional us income tax expense of approximately 400 to 500 million may be recorded in the period such change occurs this additional income tax expense results from a decrease in our net us deferred tax assets recorded through a combination of the write off of deferred tax assets and associated changes to our valuation allowance we also estimate that the ensuing additional annual limitation on our ability to use tax attribute carryovers may result in increased us income tax expense associated with such change of approximately 50 to 75 million each year 

as of june 29 2012 and july 1 2011 we had approximately 135 million and 128 million respectively of unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties the unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would impact the effective tax rate is 135 million and 128 million as of june 29 2012 and july 1 2011 respectively subject to certain future valuation allowance reversals 

it is our policy to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for taxes on the consolidated statements of operations during fiscal year 2012 we recognized a net tax expense for interest and penalties of 2 million as compared to a net tax expense for interest and penalties of less than 1 million and a net tax benefit of 1 million during fiscal year 2011 and fiscal year 2010 

respectively as of june 29 2012 we had 17 million of accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits compared to 15 million in fiscal year 2011 

during the fiscal year ended june 29 2012 our unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties increased by approximately 7 million primarily due to i increases in current year unrecognized tax benefits of 13 million ii net reductions in prior year unrecognized tax benefits of 2 million iii reductions associated with the expiration of certain statutes of limitation of 3 million iv reductions from other activity including nonus exchange gains of 1 million 

during the 12 months beginning june 30 2012 we expect to reduce our unrecognized tax benefits by approximately 5 million as a result of the expiration of certain statutes of limitation we do not believe it is reasonably possible that other unrecognized tax benefits will materially change in the next 12 months 

we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions globally and are required to file us federal us state and nonus income tax returns in may 2011 the us internal revenue service irs completed its field examination of our us federal income tax returns for fiscal years ending in 2005 through 2007 the irs issued a revenue agents report and proposed certain adjustments we are currently contesting one of these proposed adjustments through the irs appeals office we believe that the resolution of this disputed issue will have no material impact on our financial statements 

with respect to us state and nonus income tax returns we are generally no longer subject to tax examinations for years prior to fiscal year 2004 we are also no longer subject to tax examination of us federal income tax returns for years prior to fiscal year 2005 

fiscal year 2011 compared to fiscal year 2010 

revenue 



revenue in fiscal year 2011 decreased approximately 4 or 424 million from fiscal year 2010 units shipped increased 3 or 6 million units from fiscal year 2010 this decrease in revenue was due to the cumulative effect of the competitive pricing environment the industry experienced partially offset by industrywide supply constraints 

sales programs recorded as contra revenue were approximately 8 and 6 of our gross revenue for fiscal years 2011 and 2010 respectively 

gross margin 



for fiscal year 2011 gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased to 20 from 28 in the prior fiscal year primarily due to price erosion in addition gross margin was negatively impacted by delays in ramping to maturity for new products which unfavorably affected our manufacturing yields 

operating expenses 



product development expense product development expenses for fiscal year 2011 were relatively flat from fiscal year 2010 reflecting a decrease in variable performancebased compensation offset by an increase in spending for new programs and a decrease in research grants 

marketing and administrative expense the increase in marketing and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2011 compared to fiscal year 2010 was due primarily to an increase related to samsung acquisition expenses and litigation related expenses this was offset by a reduction in total compensation expenses primarily variable performancebased compensation 

amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles for fiscal year 2011 decreased from fiscal year 2010 as certain intangibles relating to the metalincs inc were fully amortized during 2011 

restructuring and other net during fiscal year 2011 the recorded restructuring and other charges were primarily associated with previously announced restructuring activities restructuring and other net during 2010 included a charge for our amk restructuring plan announced in august 2009 and a charge related to our pittsburgh pennsylvania facility 

impairment of other longlived assets net of recoveries during fiscal year 2011 we did not record any impairment charge related to our longlived assets and in 2010 we recorded an impairment charge to adjust the carrying value of certain assets held for sale to their estimated fair value less cost to sell 

other income expense net 



the change in other expense net for fiscal year 2011 compared to fiscal year 2010 was primarily due to an increase in interest expense resulting from higher average debt balances and 24 million in losses related to the redemption of debt 

income taxes 



we recorded an income tax provision of 68 million for fiscal year 2011 compared to an income tax benefit of 40 million for fiscal year 2010 our fiscal year 2011 provision for income taxes included nonus income taxes recorded for increases in income tax reserves for nonus income tax positions taken in prior fiscal years partially offset by tax benefits recorded for the release of income tax reserves associated with settlements of income tax audits and the expiration of certain statutes of limitation our fiscal year 2010 income tax benefit included 55 million of deferred tax benefit from the reversal of a portion of the us valuation allowance recorded in earlier years 

our income tax provision recorded for fiscal year 2011 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying the irish statutory rate of 25 to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i tax benefits related to nonus earnings generated in jurisdictions that are subject to tax holidays or tax incentive programs and are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of ireland ii income tax expense related to intercompany transactions iii a decrease in valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets and iv nonus losses with no tax benefit our benefit for income taxes recorded for the comparative fiscal year ended july 2 2010 differed from the provision benefit for income taxes that would be derived by applying the irish statutory rate of 25 to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i tax benefits related to nonus earnings generated in jurisdictions that are subject to tax holidays or tax incentive programs and are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of ireland ii a decrease in valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets iii nonus losses with no tax benefit and iv tax expense related to intercompany transactions 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following sections discuss our principal liquidity requirements as well as our sources and uses of cash and our liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase our shortterm investments consist primarily of readily marketable debt securities with remaining maturities of more than 90 days at the time of purchase the principal objectives of our investment policy are the preservation of principal and maintenance of liquidity we attempt to mitigate default risk by investing in highquality investment grade securities limiting the time to maturity and by monitoring the counterparties and underlying obligors closely we monitor our investment portfolio and position our portfolio to respond appropriately to a reduction in credit rating of any investment issuer guarantor or depository we intend to maintain a highly liquid portfolio by investing only in those marketable securities that we believe have active secondary or resale markets we believe our cash equivalents and shortterm investments are liquid and accessible we operate in some countries that may have restrictive regulations over the movement of cash andor foreign exchange across their borders these restrictions have not impeded our ability to conduct business in those countries nor do we expect them to in the next 12 months we are not aware of any downgrades losses or other significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or shortterm investments and accordingly we do not believe the fair value of our shortterm investments has significantly changed from the values reported as of june 29 2012 

cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and restricted cash and investments 



our cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and restricted cash and investments decreased from july 1 2011 primarily as a result of the repurchase of our ordinary shares repayments of long term debt payments made to acquire the samsung hdd business capital expenditures and dividends paid to our shareholders which were offset by cash provided by operating activities and cash received from the issuance of ordinary shares under employee stock plans 

the following table summarizes results of statement of cash flows for the periods indicated 



cash provided by operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2012 was approximately 33 billion and includes the effects of net income adjusted for noncash items including depreciation amortization stockbased compensation and 

• an increase of 824 million in accounts receivable net due to an increase in revenues • an increase of 157 million in accounts payable due to higher direct material purchases related to an increase in volume partially offset by a change in supplier payment terms and • an increase of 145 million in accrued employee compensation reflecting an increase in variable performancebased compensation cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2011 was approximately 13 billion and includes the effects of net income adjusted for noncash items including depreciation amortization stockbased compensation impairment of longlived assets and 

• an increase of 386 million in accounts payable due to higher direct material purchases related to an increase in volume • an increase of 168 million related to an increase in vendor nontrade receivables and • an increase of 115 million in inventories related to an increase in volume cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2010 was approximately 19 billion and includes the effects of net income adjusted for noncash items including depreciation amortization stockbased compensation impairment of longlived assets and 

• an increase of 367 million in accounts receivable due to an increase in revenue and • an increase of 170 million in inventories due to an increase in production requirements cash used in investing activities 

in fiscal year 2012 we used 11 billion for net cash investing activities which was due primarily to payments for property equipment and leasehold improvements of approximately 636 million and net payments for the acquisition of samsungs hdd business of 561 million 

in fiscal year 2011 we used 981 million for net cash investing activities which was primarily attributable to payments for property equipment and leasehold improvements of approximately 843 million 

in fiscal year 2010 we used 752 million for net cash investing activities which was primarily attributable to payments for property equipment and leasehold improvements of approximately 639 million 

cash provided by used in financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities of 31 billion for fiscal year 2012 was attributable to 24 billion paid to repurchase 101 million of our ordinary shares 670 million in long term debt repayments and 372 million in dividends paid to our shareholders this was partially offset by 344 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchases 

net cash provided by financing activities of 131 million for fiscal year 2011 was attributable to 13 billion in net proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt partially offset by 822 million to repurchase 569 million of our ordinary shares and 377 million for the repayment of our longterm debt 

net cash used in financing activities of 344 million for fiscal year 2010 was primarily attributable to the repayment of 350 million of our amended credit facility and the repayment and repurchases of 457 million of our longterm debt the repayment and repurchases were paid primarily with 379 million of restricted cash previously held in escrow we also paid approximately 584 million to repurchase 324 million of our ordinary shares which was partially offset by 587 million in net proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt and 86 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchases 

liquidity sources 

our primary sources of liquidity as of june 29 2012 consisted of 1 approximately 21 billion in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments 2 cash we expect to generate from operations and 3 a 350 million senior secured revolving credit facility we also had 93 million in restricted cash and investments of which 73 million was related to our employee deferred compensation liabilities under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan 

on january 18 2011 seagate technology plc and its subsidiary seagate hdd entered into a credit agreement which provides for a 350 million senior secured revolving credit facility seagate technology plc and certain of its material subsidiaries fully and unconditionally guarantee on a senior secured basis the revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility matures in january 2015 the revolving credit facility is available for cash borrowings and for the issuance of letters of credit up to a sublimit of 75 million as of june 29 2012 no borrowings have been drawn under the revolving credit facility and 2 million had been utilized for letters of credit the line of credit is available for borrowings subject to compliance with financial covenants and other customary conditions to borrowing 

the credit agreement that governs our revolving credit facility contains certain covenants that we must satisfy in order to remain in compliance with the credit agreement including three financial covenants 1 minimum amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities 2 a fixed charge coverage ratio and 3 a net leverage ratio as of june 29 2012 we are in compliance with all covenants including the financial ratios that we are required to maintain 

we believe that our sources of cash will be sufficient to fund our operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months 

cash requirements and commitments 

our liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital research and development and capital expenditure needs to fund scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness and to fund our dividend our ability to fund these requirements will depend on our future cash flows which are determined by future operating performance and therefore subject to prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and financial business and other factors some of which are beyond our control 

on july 25 2012 our board of directors approved a cash dividend of 032 per share which will be payable on august 26 2012 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on august 5 2012 

as of june 29 2012 we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our debt agreements based on our current outlook we expect to be in compliance with the covenants of our debt agreements over the next 12 months 

the carrying value of our longterm debt as of june 29 2012 and july 1 2011 was 29 billion and 35 billion respectively the table below presents the principal amounts of our outstanding longterm debt in order of maturity 



during fiscal year 2012 we repurchased approximately 101 million of our ordinary shares see item 5 market for registrants shares related shareholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securitiesrepurchases of our equity securities 

for fiscal year 2013 we expect capital investment to be below the historical targeted range of 68 of revenue we require substantial amounts of cash to fund scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness future capital expenditures and any increased working capital requirements we will continue to evaluate and manage the retirement and replacement of existing debt and associated obligations including the issuance of new debt securities exchanging existing debt securities for other debt securities and retiring debt pursuant to privately negotiated transactions open market purchases or otherwise in addition we may selectively pursue strategic alliances acquisitions and investments which may require additional capital 

contractual obligations and commitments 

our contractual cash obligations and commitments as of june 29 2012 have been summarized in the table below 



1 includes total future minimum rent expense under noncancelable leases for both occupied and vacated facilities rent expense is shown net of sublease income 2 purchase obligations are defined as contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services which are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms 

as of june 29 2012 we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits and an accrual for the payment of related interest totaling 82 million none of which is expected to be settled within one year outside of one year we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlement with a taxing authority will occur 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of june 29 2012 we did not have any material offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of regulation sk 

critical accounting policies 

the methods estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements the sec has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are highly uncertain at the time of estimation based on this definition our most critical policies include establishment of sales program accruals establishment of warranty accruals accounting for income taxes and the accounting for goodwill and other longlived assets below we discuss these policies further as well as the estimates and judgments involved we also have other accounting policies and accounting estimates relating to uncollectible customer accounts valuation of inventory valuation of sharebased payments and restructuring we believe that these other accounting policies and accounting estimates either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective or it is less likely that they would have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period 

establishment of sales program accruals we establish certain distributor and oem sales programs aimed at increasing customer demand for the distribution channel these programs typically involve 

rebates related to a distributors level of sales order size advertising or point of sale activity and price protection adjustments for oem sales rebates are typically based on an oem customers volume of purchases or other agreed upon rebate programs we provide for these obligations at the time that revenue is recorded based on estimated requirements we estimate these contrarevenue rebates and adjustments based on various factors including price reductions during the period reported estimated future price erosion customer orders distributor sellthrough and inventory levels program participation customer claim submittals and sales returns our estimates reflect contractual arrangements but also our judgment relating to variables such as customer claim rates and attainment of program goals and inventory and sellthrough levels reported by our distribution customers currently our distributors inventories are at the low end of the historical range 

while we believe we have sufficient experience and knowledge of the market and customer buying patterns to reasonably estimate such rebates and adjustments actual market conditions or customer behavior could differ from our expectations as a result actual payments under these programs which may spread over several months after the related sale may vary from the amount accrued accordingly revenues and margins in the period in which the adjustment occurs may be affected 

significant actual variations in any of the factors upon which we base our contrarevenue estimates could have a material effect on our operating results in fiscal year 2012 sales programs were approximately 6 of gross revenue reflecting the cumulative effect of the advantageous pricing environment during the second half of fiscal year 2012 for fiscal years 2011 and 2010 total sales programs ranged from 6 to 12 of gross revenues adjustments to revenues due to under or over accruals for sales programs related to revenues reported in prior quarterly periods averaged 05 of quarterly gross revenue for fiscal years 2010 through 2011 and were approximately 02 of gross revenue in fiscal year 2012 any future shifts in the industry supplydemand balance as well as other factors may result in a more competitive pricing environment and may cause sales programs as a percentage of gross revenue to increase from the current or historical levels if such rebates and incentives trend upwards revenues and margins will be reduced 

establishment of warranty accruals we estimate probable product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized we generally warrant our products for a period of 1 to 5 years our warranty provision considers estimated product failure rates and trends including the timing of product returns during the warranty periods and estimated repair or replacement costs related to product quality issues if any we also exercise judgment in estimating our ability to sell certain repaired disk drives should actual experience in any future period differ significantly from our estimates our future results of operations could be materially affected our judgment is subject to a greater degree of subjectivity with respect to newly introduced products because of limited experience with those products upon which to base our warranty estimates 

the actual results with regard to warranty expenditures could have an adverse or favorable effect on our results of operations if the actual rate of unit failure the cost to repair a unit or the actual cost required to satisfy customer claims differs from those estimates we used in determining the warranty accrual since we typically outsource our warranty repairs our repair cost is subject to periodic negotiations with vendors and may vary from our estimates we also exercise judgment in estimating our ability to sell certain repaired disk drives to the extent such sales fall below our forecast warranty cost will be adversely impacted 

we review our warranty accrual quarterly for products shipped in prior periods and which are still under warranty any changes in the estimates underlying the accrual may result in adjustments that impact the current period gross margins and income in fiscal year 2012 net favorable changes in estimates of prior warranty accruals as a percentage of revenue were immaterial our total warranty cost was 15 18 and 13 of revenue during fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively while warranty cost related to new shipments exclusive of the impact of reestimates of preexisting liabilities were 12 18 and 

18 respectively for the same periods changes in anticipated failure rates of specific products and significant changes in repair or replacement costs have historically been the major reasons for significant changes in prior estimates any future changes in failure rates of certain products as well as changes in repair costs or the cost of replacement parts may result in increased or decreased warranty accruals 

accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes pursuant to accounting standards codification asc topic 740 asc 740 income taxes in applying asc 740 we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits recognition of income and deductions and calculation of specific tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions the calculation of tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the internal revenue service or other tax jurisdictions if estimates of these tax liabilities are greater or less than actual results an additional tax benefit or provision will result the deferred tax assets we record each period depend primarily on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states and certain nonus jurisdictions each period we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and if necessary we adjust the valuation allowance so that net deferred tax assets are recorded only to the extent we conclude it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized if our outlook for future taxable income changes significantly our assessment of the need for a valuation allowance may also change 

assessing goodwill and other longlived assets for impairment we account for goodwill in accordance with asc 350 intangibles—goodwill and other  as required by asc 350 we perform a qualitative assessment in determining whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount based on the qualitative assessment if it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then the company is not required to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test 

in accordance with asc 360054 impairment or disposal of longlived assets  we test other longlived assets including property equipment and leasehold improvements and other intangible assets subject to amortization for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of those assets may not be recoverable we assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using the same approaches indicated above for asc 360 step two and compare it to its carrying value the excess of the carrying value over the fair value is allocated pro rata to derive the adjusted carrying value of each asset in the asset group the adjusted carrying value of each asset in the asset group is not reduced below its fair value

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we have exposure to market risks due to the volatility of interest rates foreign currency exchange rates equity and bond markets a portion of these risks are hedged but fluctuations could impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows additionally we have exposure to downgrades in the credit ratings of our counterparties as well as exposure related to our credit rating changes 

interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio at june 29 2012 with the exception of our auction rate securities we had no marketable securities that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for a period greater than 12 months and determined that no investments were otherthantemporarily impaired we currently do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 

we have fixed rate debt obligations we enter into debt obligations for general corporate purposes including capital expenditures and working capital needs we currently do not use interest rate derivatives to hedge interest rate exposure on our outstanding debt 

the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio and debt obligations as of june 29 2012 all shortterm investments mature in four years or less 

fiscal years ended 



foreign currency exchange risk we may enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposure related to certain foreign currency commitments and anticipated foreign currency denominated expenditures our policy prohibits us from entering into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes during fiscal years 2012 and 2011 we did not enter into any hedges of net investments in foreign operations 

we also hedge a portion of our foreign currency denominated balance sheet positions with foreign currency forward exchange contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings will be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates the changes in fair value of these hedges are recognized in earnings in the same period as the gains and losses from the remeasurement of the assets and liabilities these foreign currency forward exchange contracts are not designated as hedging instruments under asc 815 derivatives and hedging all these forward contracts mature within 12 months 

we evaluate hedging effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively and record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in costs of revenue on the consolidated statements of operations we did not have any material net gains losses recognized in costs of revenue for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness or discontinued cash flow hedges during fiscal years 2012 and 2011 

the table below provides information as of june 29 2012 about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts the table is provided in us dollar equivalent amounts and presents the notional 

amounts at the contract exchange rates and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates 



1 equivalent to the unrealized net gain loss on existing contracts 

other market risks we have exposure to counterparty credit downgrades in the form of credit risk related to our foreign currency forward exchange contracts and our fixed income portfolio we monitor and limit our credit exposure for our foreign currency forward exchange contracts by performing ongoing credit evaluations we also manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with any one counterparty and we maintain limits on maximum tenor of contracts based on the credit rating of the financial institutions additionally the investment portfolio is diversified and structured to minimize credit risk as of june 29 2012 we had counterparty credit exposure of 1 million comprised of the marktomarket valuation related to our foreign currency forward exchange contracts in a gain position changes in our corporate issuer credit ratings have minimal impact on our financial results but downgrades may negatively impact our future transaction costs and our ability to execute transactions with various counterparties 

we are subject to equity market risks due to changes in the fair value of the notional investments selected by our employees as part of our seagate deferred compensation plan the sdcp we currently manage our exposure to equity market risks associated with the sdcp liabilities by investing directly in mutual funds that mirror the employees investment options 

as of june 29 2012 we continued to hold auction rate securities with a par value of approximately 17 million all of which are collateralized by student loans guaranteed by the federal family education loan program beginning in the march 2008 quarter these securities have continuously failed to settle at auction as of june 29 2012 the estimated fair value of these auction rate securities was 15 million we believe that the impairments totaling 2 million are temporary as we do not intend to sell these securities and have concluded it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the securities before the recovery of the amortized cost basis as such the impairment was recorded in other comprehensive income loss and these securities were classified as longterm investments

storage services another area within the electronic data storage industry is services and solutions related to the backup archiving recovery and discovery of electronic data 

demand for electronic data storage 

the electronic data storage industry has traditionally been focused on client compute applications we believe that technological advances in storage technology and a proliferation of client noncompute applications such as digital video recorders gaming devices digital music players and digital cameras are driving the broad global proliferation and growth of digital content through the 

• creation and sharing of all types of digital content such as highresolution photos high definition video and movies and music by consumers and electronic data by enterprises • aggregation and distribution of digital content through services and other offerings such as youtube facebook pandora itunes hulu and linkedin • network and video infrastructure  including broadband internet protocol television iptv cable and satellite that has enabled the access hosting and distribution of such digital content • enjoyment and consumption of digital content through dvrs handheld devices tablets and gaming consoles as well as in automobiles and • protection of digital content through storage on backup devices and storage services as a result of these factors the nature and amount of content being created requires increasingly higher storage capacity in order to store manage distribute utilize and backup such content this in turn has resulted in the rapid growth in demand for electronic data storage applications and solutions which we believe will continue to grow with the increased demand for electronic data storage in developed countries as well as in emerging economies 

we believe that demand for electronic data storage in the enterprise and traditional compute markets continues to grow as the proliferation of digital content in the consumer space has resulted in additional demand for storage by enterprises including those that host aggregate distribute or share such content other factors driving demand for additional storage include 

• continued growth in cloud computing and backup services for enterprises seeking efficient and costeffective methods of processing and storing mass data increases demand for storage as data centers expand and proliferate • increasing legal and regulatory requirements which necessitate larger archives and • changes in the nature and amount of data being stored such as the growing use of digital records in the healthcare industry demand trends for disk drives 

we believe that continued growth in digital content requires increasingly higher storage capacity in order to store aggregate host distribute manage backup and use such content which we believe will continue to result in increased demand for disk drive products in addition we believe the continued increase in demand for disk drives in developed countries as well as in emerging economies reflects the demand for realtime access to rich data and content driven by the impact of a highly mobile and increasingly connected user base we believe these trends will continue as computing architectures evolve to serve the growing commercial and consumer user base throughout the world 

historically the electronic data storage industry has introduced alternative technologies that directly compete with hard disk drives ssds using nand flash memory are a potential alternative to disk drives in certain applications such as consumer handheld devices tablets and portable external storage nand flash memory is a type of nonvolatile storage technology however we believe that in the foreseeable future the traditional enterprise and client compute markets that require high capacity storage solutions as well as the data intensive client noncompute markets will continue to be best served by hard disk drives based on the industrys ability to deliver reliable energy efficient and cost effective mass storage devices 

disk drives for enterprise storage we define enterprise storage as disk drives designed for mission critical applications and nearline applications 

mission critical applications are defined as applications that are vital to the operation of enterprises requiring high performance and high reliability disk drives we expect the market for mission critical enterprise storage solutions to continue to be driven by enterprises moving network traffic to dedicated storage area networks in an effort to reduce network complexity and increase energy savings we believe that this transition will lead to an increased demand for more energy efficient smaller form factor disk drives these solutions are comprised principally of high performance enterprise class disk drives with sophisticated firmware and communications technologies 

nearline applications are defined as applications that are capacityintensive and require high capacity and energy efficient disk drives featuring low costs per gigabyte we expect such applications which include storage for cloud computing and backup services will continue to grow and drive demand for disk drives designed with these attributes 

ssd storage applications have been introduced as a potential alternative to redundant system startup or boot disk drives in addition enterprises are gradually adopting ssds in applications where rapid processing andor energy efficiency is required the timing of significant adoption of ssds is dependent on enterprises weighing the cost effectiveness and other benefits of mission critical enterprise disk drives against the perceived performance benefits of ssds 

disk drives for client compute we define client compute applications as disk drives designed for the traditional desktop and mobile compute applications we believe that the increase in demand resulting from growing economies of certain countries and the continued proliferation of digital content will drive the demand for the client compute market 

disk drives for client noncompute we define client noncompute applications as disk drives designed for consumer electronic devices and disk drives used for external storage and networkattached storage nas disk drives designed for consumer electronic devices are primarily used in applications such as dvrs that require a higher capacity low costpergigabyte storage solution disk drives for external and nas devices are designed for purposes such as personal data backup and portable external storage and to augment storage capacity in the consumers current desktop notebook tablet or dvr disk drive capacities client noncompute applications also include devices designed to display digital media in the home theater we believe the proliferation of high definition and mediarich digital content will continue to create increasing consumer demand for higher storage solutions as the proliferation of client noncompute applications that require minimal storage such as tablets continues ssds could become more competitive within the client compute market in the future 

industry supply balance 

from time to time the industry has experienced periods of imbalance between supply and demand to the extent that the disk drive industry builds capacity based on expectations of demand that do not materialize price erosion may become more pronounced conversely during periods where demand exceeds supply price erosion is generally muted for the first half of fiscal year 2011 our industry experienced a period of relative balance between supply and demand we also believe there was unmet demand in the last quarter of fiscal year 2011 due to a reaction to possible supply chain disruptions stemming from the earthquake and tsunami in japan however the industry returned to a relatively balanced supply environment at the end of the fiscal year 

disk drive technology 

overview 

the design and manufacturing of disk drives depends on highly advanced technology and manufacturing techniques and therefore requires high levels of research and development spending and capital equipment investments manufacturing our disk drives is a complex process that begins with the production of individual components and ends with a fully assembled unit we design fabricate and assemble a number of the most important components found in our disk drives including readwrite heads and recording media our design and manufacturing operations are based on technology platforms that are used to produce various disk drive products that serve multiple data storage applications and markets our core technology platforms are focused around the areal density of media and readwrite head technologies using an integrated platform design and manufacturing leverage approach allows us to deliver a portfolio of disk drive products to service a wide range of electronic data storage applications and a wide range of industries 

disk drive performance 

disk drive performance is commonly differentiated by six key characteristics 

• storage capacity commonly expressed in gigabytes gb or terabytes tb which is the amount of data that can be stored on the disk • spindle rotation speed commonly expressed in revolutions per minute rpm which has an effect on speed of access to data • interface transfer rate commonly expressed in megabytes per second which is the rate at which data moves between the disk drive and the computer controller • average seek time commonly expressed in milliseconds which is the time needed to position the heads over a selected track on the disk surface • data transfer rate commonly expressed in megabytes per second which is the rate at which data is transferred to and from the disk and • product quality and reliability commonly expressed in annualized return rates areal density 

areal density is a measure of storage capacity per square inch on the recording surface of a disk the capacity of a disk drive is determined by the number of disks it contains as well as the areal density capability of these disks we have been pursuing and will continue to pursue a number of technologies to increase areal densities across the entire range of our products for expanding disk drive capacities and reducing the number of disks and heads per drive to further reduce product costs 

manufacturing 

disk drive manufacturers are distinguished by their level of vertical integration which is the degree to which they control the design and manufacture of the technology used in their products and by whether they are captive producing disk drives for their own computer systems or independent producing disk drives as a standalone product 

vertically integrated hard drive manufacturers design and produce their own readwrite heads and recording media which are critical technologies for disk drives this integrated approach enables manufacturers to lower costs and to improve the functionality of components so that they work together efficiently in contrast manufacturers that are not integrated purchase most of their components from thirdparty suppliers upon whom they depend for key elements of their technological innovation and 

differentiation this can limit their ability to coordinate technology roadmaps and optimize the component design process for manufacturing efficiency and product reliability while making them reliant on the technology investment decisions of their suppliers independent manufacturers can enjoy a competitive advantage over captive manufacturers in working with oems because they do not compete with oems for computer system sales we believe the competitive dynamics of the disk drive industry favor vertically integrated independent manufacturers with the scale to make substantial technology investments and apply them across a broad product portfolio and set of customers 

we pursue a vertically integrated business strategy based on the ownership of critical component technologies allowing us to maintain control over our product roadmap and component cost quality and availability we believe that because of our vertical design and manufacturing strategy we are well suited to meet the challenges posed by the close interdependence of components for disk drives our manufacturing efficiency and flexibility are critical elements of our integrated business strategy we continuously seek to improve our manufacturing efficiency and cost by 

• employing manufacturing automation to enhance our efficiency • improving product quality and reliability and reducing costs • integrating our supply chain with suppliers and customers to enhance our demand visibility and reduce our working capital requirements • coordinating between our manufacturing group and our research and development organization to rapidly achieve volume manufacturing and • rationalizing the facilities we operate and reducing the number of personnel we employ a vertically integrated model however tends to have less flexibility when demand moderates as it exposes us to higher unit costs as capacity utilization is not optimized 

due to the significant challenges posed by the need to continually innovate and improve manufacturing efficiency and the continued demands on capital and research and development investments required to do so the disk drive industry has undergone significant consolidation as disk drive manufacturers and component manufacturers merged with other companies or exited the industry the increasing technological challenges associated levels of investment and competitive necessity of largescale operations may also drive future industry consolidation additionally we may in the future face indirect competition from customers who from time to time evaluate whether to offer electronic data storage products that may compete with our products 

components and raw materials 

all of our disk drive products incorporate certain components including a head disk assembly and a printed circuit board mounted to the head disk assembly which are sealed inside a rigid base and top cover containing the recording components in a contamination controlled environment we maintain a highly integrated approach to our business by designing and manufacturing a significant portion of the components we view as critical to our products such as recording heads and media 

readwrite heads the function of the readwrite head is to scan across the disk as it spins magnetically recording or reading information the tolerances of recording heads are extremely demanding and require stateoftheart equipment and processes our readwrite heads are manufactured with thinfilm and photolithographic processes similar to those used to produce semiconductor integrated circuits though challenges in magnetic film properties and topographical structures are unique to the disk drive industry we perform all primary stages of design and manufacture of readwrite heads at our facilities we use a combination of internally manufactured and externally sourced readwrite heads the mix of which varies based on product mix technology and our internal capacity levels 

media information is written to the media or disk as it rotates at very high speeds past the readwrite head the media is made from nonmagnetic material usually aluminum alloy or glass and is coated with a thin layer of magnetic material we use a combination of internally manufactured and externally sourced finished media and aluminum substrates the mix of which varies based on product mix technology and our internal capacity levels we purchase all of our glass substrates from third parties which we use in the disk drives we make for mobile products 

printed circuit board assemblies the printed circuit board assemblies pcbas are comprised of standard and custom asics and ancillary electronic control chips the asics control the movement of data to and from the readwrite heads and through the internal controller and interface which communicates with the host computer the asics and control chips form electronic circuitry that delivers instructions to a head positioning mechanism called an actuator to guide the heads to the selected track of a disk where the data is recorded or retrieved disk drive manufacturers use one or more industry standard interfaces such as serial advanced technology architecture sata small computer system interface scsi serial attached scsi sas or fibre channel fc to communicate to the host systems we outsource to third parties the manufacture and assembly of the pcbas used in our disk drives we do not manufacture any asics but we participate in their proprietary design 

head disk assembly the head disk assembly consists of one or more disks attached to a spindle assembly powered by a spindle motor that rotates the disks at a high constant speed around a hub readwrite heads mounted on an arm assembly similar in concept to that of a record player fly extremely close to each disk surface and record data on and retrieve it from concentric tracks in the magnetic layers of the rotating disks the readwrite heads are mounted vertically on an eshaped assembly eblock that is actuated by a voicecoil motor to allow the heads to move from track to track the eblock and the recording media are mounted inside the head disk assembly we purchase spindle motors from outside vendors and from time to time participate in the design of the motors that go into our products 

disk drive assembly following the completion of the head disk assembly it is mated to the pcba and the completed unit goes through extensive defect mapping and testing prior to packaging and shipment disk drive assembly and test operations occur primarily at facilities located in china and thailand we perform subassembly and component manufacturing operations at our facilities in china malaysia northern ireland singapore thailand and in the united states in minnesota in addition third parties manufacture and assemble components for us in various asian countries including china japan south korea malaysia the philippines singapore taiwan thailand and vietnam in europe and in the united states 

suppliers of components and industry constraints due to industry consolidation there are a limited number of independent suppliers of components such as recording heads and media available to disk drive manufacturers vertically integrated disk drive manufacturers who manufacture their own components are less dependent on external component suppliers than less vertically integrated disk drive manufacturers 

commodity and other manufacturing costs the production of disk drives requires rare earth elements precious metals scarce alloys and industrial commodities which are subject to fluctuations in prices and the supply of which has at times been constrained during the latter part of fiscal year 2011 the industry experienced significant increases in the costs of rare earth elements which are used in magnets as well as in the process for polishing glass substrates in addition to increased costs of components and commodities volatility in fuel costs may also increase our costs related to commodities manufacturing and freight as a result we may increase our use of ocean shipments to help offset any increase in freight costs

customers 

we sell our disk drives to major oems distributors and retailers under our globally recognized brand names we have longstanding relationships with many of our oem customers such as hewlettpackard company dell inc and emc corporation 

the following table summarizes our disk drive revenue by channel and by geography 



oem customers typically enter into master purchase agreements with us these agreements provide for pricing volume discounts order lead times product support obligations and other terms and conditions the term of these agreements is usually 6 to 24 months however they are generally cancelable for convenience by either party upon written notice our product support obligations generally extend substantially beyond the term of these agreements these master agreements typically do not commit the customer to buy any minimum quantity of products or create exclusive relationships deliveries are scheduled only after receipt of purchase orders in addition with limited leadtime customers may cancel or defer most purchase orders without significant penalty anticipated orders from many of our customers have in the past failed to materialize or oem delivery schedules have been deferred or altered as a result of changes in their business needs 

our distributors generally enter into nonexclusive agreements for the resale of our products they typically furnish us with a nonbinding indication of their nearterm requirements and product deliveries are generally scheduled accordingly the agreements and related sales programs typically provide the distributors with limited right of return and price protection rights in addition we offer sales programs to distributors on a quarterly and periodic basis to promote the sale of selected products in the sales channel 

our retail channel consists of our branded storage products sold to retailers either by us directly or by our distributors retail sales made by us or our distributors typically require greater marketing support sales incentives and price protection periods 

in fiscal year 2011 hewlettpackard company accounted for approximately 15 of consolidated revenue while dell inc accounted for approximately 13 of consolidated revenue in each of fiscal years 2010 and 2009 hewlettpackard company accounted for approximately 16 of consolidated revenue while dell inc accounted for approximately 11 of consolidated revenue we have master purchase agreements in place with hewlettpackard company and dell inc that are cancelable for convenience by either party upon written notice and do not require either customer to purchase any minimum or other specified quantity of our products see item 1a risk factors—risks related to our business—dependence on key customers—we may be adversely affected by the loss of or reduced delayed or cancelled purchases by one or more of our larger customers 

competition 

the markets that we compete in are intensely competitive disk drive manufacturers not only compete for a limited number of major disk drive customers but also compete with other companies in the electronic data storage industry that provide alternative storage solutions such as flash memory tape optical and ssds some of the principal factors used by customers to differentiate among electronic data storage solutions manufacturers are storage capacity price per unit and price per gigabyte storageretrieval access times data transfer rates product quality and reliability supply continuity form factor warranty and brand we believe that our disk drive products are competitive with respect to each of these factors in the markets that we currently address 

we summarize below our principal disk drive competitors other competitors the effect of competition on price erosion for our products product life cycles and technology 

principal disk drive competitors we have experienced and expect to continue to experience intense competition from a number of domestic and foreign companies some of which have greater financial and other resources than we have these competitors include independent disk drive manufacturers such as western digital corporation as well as large captive manufacturers such as hitachi global storage technologies samsung electronics co ltd and toshiba corporation because these captive manufacturers produce complete computer systems and other noncompute consumer electronics and mobile devices they can derive a greater portion of their operating margins from other components which may reduce their need to realize a profit on the disk drives included in their computer systems and may allow them to sell disk drives to third parties at very low margins many captive manufacturers are also formidable competitors because they have more resources and greater access to their internal customers than we do in addition competitors such as samsung electronics co ltd and toshiba corporation are increasingly integrating other storage technologies such as flash memory hybrid disk drives and ssds into their product offerings not only may they be willing to sell their disk drives at a lower margin to advance their overall business strategy their portfolio may allow them to be indifferent to which technology prevails over the other as they can offer a broad range of storage media and solutions and focus on those with lowest costs and greatest sales in addition to competing with our disk drive competitors we also compete with companies such as iomega corporation an emc company and lacie sa that purchase disk drives from us and our competitors for use in their branded storage products 

other competitors we also are experiencing competition from companies that provide alternative storage technologies such as flash memory and ssds in the flash memory market primarily used in lower capacity handheld devices our principal competitors include micron technology inc samsung electronics co ltd sandisk corporation and toshiba corporation in enterprise applications where ssds are used for rapid processing and high volume transactions our principal ssd competitors include hitachi global storage technologies intel corporation and stec inc with others expected to enter in the near future 

price erosion our industry has been characterized by price declines for disk drive products with comparable capacity performance and feature sets likeforlike products price declines for likeforlike products price erosion are more pronounced during periods of 

• economic contraction or industry consolidation in which competitors may use discounted pricing to attempt to maintain or gain market share • few new product introductions when multiple competitors have comparable or alternative product offerings • temporary imbalances between industry supply and demand and • seasonally weaker demand which may cause excess supply 12 

disk drive manufacturers typically attempt to offset price erosion with an improved mix of disk drive products characterized by higher capacity better performance and additional feature sets andor product cost reductions 

we expect price erosion in our industry to continue to remain competitive we believe it is necessary for industry participants to continue to introduce new product offerings that utilize advanced technologies ahead of the competition in order to take advantage of potentially higher initial profit margins and reduced cost structures on these new products 

product life cycles and changing technology our industry has been characterized by significant advances in technology which have contributed to rapid product life cycles as a result success in our industry has been dependent to a large extent on the ability to be the firsttomarket with new products allowing those disk drive manufacturers who introduce new products first to benefit from improved product mix favorable profit margins and less pricing pressure until comparable products are introduced also because our industry is characterized by continuous price erosion the existence of rapid product life cycles has necessitated quick achievement of product cost effectiveness changing technology also necessitates ongoing investments in research and development which may be difficult to recover due to rapid product life cycles and economic declines further there is a continued need to successfully execute product transitions and new product introductions as factors such as quality reliability and manufacturing yields become of increasing competitive importance 

seasonality 

the disk drive industry traditionally experiences seasonal variability in demand with higher levels of demand in the second half of the calendar year this seasonality is driven by consumer spending in the backtoschool season from late summer to fall and the traditional holiday shopping season from fall to winter in addition corporate demand is typically higher during the second half of the calendar year however with volatility in fuel costs the industry may be experiencing higher levels of demand earlier in the calendar year as customers attempt to take advantage of less expensive modes of transportation which generally require longer lead times 

research and development 

we are committed to developing new component technologies products and alternative storage technologies including solid state technology our research and development focus is designed to bring new products to market in high volume with quality attributes that our customers expect before our competitors part of our product development strategy is to leverage a design platform andor subsystem within product families to serve different market needs this platform strategy allows for more efficient resource utilization leverages best design practices reduces exposure to changes in demand and allows for achievement of lower costs through purchasing economies our advanced technology integration effort focuses disk drive and component research on recording subsystems including readwrite heads and recording media marketspecific product technology and technology focused towards new business opportunities the primary purpose of our advanced technology integration effort is to ensure timely availability of mature component technologies to our product development teams as well as allowing us to leverage and coordinate those technologies in the design centers across our products in order to take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace during fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 we had product development expenses of approximately 875 million 877 million and 953 million respectively which represented 8 8 and 10 of our consolidated revenue respectively 

patents and licenses 

as of july 1 2011 we had 4370 us patents and 553 patents issued in various foreign jurisdictions as well as 1093 us and 444 foreign patent applications pending the number of patents and patent 

applications will vary at any given time as part of our ongoing patent portfolio management activity due to the rapid technological change that characterizes the electronic data storage industry we believe that in addition to patent protection the improvement of existing products reliance upon trade secrets protection of unpatented proprietary knowhow and development of new products are also important to our business in establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage accordingly we intend to continue our efforts to broadly protect our intellectual property including obtaining patents where available in connection with our research and development program 

the electronic data storage industry is characterized by significant litigation relating to patent and other intellectual property rights because of rapid technological development in the electronic data storage industry some of our products have been and in the future could be alleged to infringe existing patents of third parties from time to time we receive claims that our products infringe patents of third parties although we have been able to resolve some of those claims or potential claims by obtaining licenses or rights under the patents in question without a material adverse affect on us other claims have resulted in adverse decisions or settlements in addition other claims are pending which if resolved unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations for more information on these claims see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data—note 13 legal environmental and other contingencies the costs of engaging in intellectual property litigation in the past have been and in the future may be substantial irrespective of the merits of the claim or the outcome we have patent licenses with a number of companies additionally as part of our normal intellectual property practices we may be engaged in negotiations with other major electronic data storage companies and component manufacturers with respect to patent licenses 

backlog 

in view of our customers rights to cancel or defer orders with little or no penalty we believe backlog in the disk drive industry is of limited indicative value in estimating future performance and results 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to us and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites some of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution and these permits are subject to modification renewal and revocation by issuing authorities 

we have established environmental management systems and continually update our environmental policies and standard operating procedures for our operations worldwide we believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws regulations and permits we budget for operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental laws if additional or more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future we could incur additional operating costs and capital expenditures 

some environmental laws such as the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended the superfund law and its state equivalents can impose liability for the cost of cleanup of contaminated sites upon any of the current or former site owners or operators or upon parties who sent waste to these sites regardless of whether the owner or operator owned the site at the time of the release of hazardous substances or the lawfulness of the original disposal activity we have been identified as a potentially responsible party at several sites at each of these sites we have an assigned portion of the financial liability based on the type and amount of hazardous substances disposed of by each party at the site and the number of financially viable parties we have fulfilled our responsibilities at some of these sites and remain involved in only a few sites at this time 

while our ultimate costs in connection with these sites is difficult to predict with complete accuracy based on our current estimates of cleanup costs and our expected allocation of these costs we do not expect costs in connection with these sites to be material 

we may be subject to various state federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment including those restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products for example the european union eu enacted the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment which prohibits the use of certain substances including lead in certain products including disk drives put on the market after july 1 2006 similar legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions including in the united states canada mexico taiwan china japan and others the european union reach directive registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals ec 19072006 also restricts substances of very high concern svhcs in products 

if we or our suppliers fail to comply with the substance restrictions recycle requirements or other environmental requirements as they are enacted worldwide it could have a materially adverse effect on our business 

employees 

at july 1 2011 we employed approximately 52700 employees temporary employees and contractors worldwide of which approximately 45500 employees were located in our asian operations we believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees at all levels we believe that our employee relations are good

 item 1a risk factors 

risks related to our business 

macroeconomic conditions—changes in the macroeconomic environment have and may continue to negatively impact our results of operations 

due to the continuing uncertainty about current macroeconomic conditions we believe our customers may postpone spending in response to tighter credit unemployment negative financial news andor declines in income or asset values which could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products other factors that could influence demand include conditions in the residential real estate and mortgage markets labor and healthcare costs access to credit consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior these and other economic factors could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and on our financial condition and operating results 

in addition the capital and credit markets continue to experience some measure of volatility and disruption resulting in a tightening in the credit markets a low level of liquidity in many financial markets and reduced stability in fixed income credit currency and equity markets there could be a number of followon effects from the credit crisis on our business including our customers being less able to obtain financing to purchase our products 

competition—our industry is highly competitive and our products have experienced and will continue to experience significant price erosion and market share variability 

the disk drive industry is intensely competitive and vendors typically experience substantial price erosion over the life of a product our competitors have historically offered existing products at lower prices as part of a strategy to gain or retain market share and customers and we expect these practices to continue we will need to continually reduce our prices for existing products to retain our market share which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we believe price erosion and market share variability will continue as the industry engages in aggressive pricing actions targeted to shift customer demand to offset lower demand due to the deterioration in business and economic conditions 

our ability to offset the effect of price erosion through new product introductions at higher average prices is diminished to the extent competitors introduce products into particular markets ahead of our similar competing products this risk is particularly pronounced in markets where we have experienced lower market share as is the case in the market for 25inch ata products our ability to offset the effect of price erosion is also diminished during times when product life cycles for particular products are extended allowing competitors more time to enter the market 

the growth of sales to distributors that serve producers of nonbranded products in the personal storage sector may also contribute to increased price erosion these customers generally have limited product qualification programs which increases the number of competing products available to satisfy their demand as a result purchasing decisions for these customers are based largely on price and terms any increase in our average price erosion would have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

additionally a significant portion of our success in the past has been a result of increasing our market share at the expense of our competitors particularly in enterprise markets market share for our products can be negatively affected by our customers diversifying their sources of supply as our competitors enter the market for particular products as well as by our ability to ramp volume production of new product offerings when our competitors successfully introduce product offerings that are competitive with our recently introduced products our customers may quickly diversify their sources of supply any significant 

decline in our market share in any of our principal market applications would adversely affect our results of operations 

principal competitors—we compete with both independent manufacturers whose primary focus is producing technologically advanced disk drives and captive manufacturers who do not depend solely on sales of disk drives to maintain their profitability 

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience intense competition from a number of domestic and foreign companies including other independent disk drive manufacturers and large captive manufacturers the term independent in this context refers to manufacturers that primarily produce disk drives as a standalone product such as western digital corporation and the term captive in this context refers to manufacturers who themselves or through affiliated entities produce complete computer or other systems that contain disk drives or other electronic data storage products such as hitachi global storage technologies samsung electronics incorporated and toshiba corporation 

captive manufacturers are formidable competitors because they have the ability to determine pricing for complete systems without regard to the margins on individual components as components other than disk drives generally contribute a greater portion of the operating margin on a complete computer system than do disk drives captive manufacturers do not necessarily need to realize a profit on the disk drives included in a complete computer system and as a result may be willing to sell disk drives to third parties at very low margins captive manufacturers are also formidable competitors because they have more substantial resources than we do samsung and hitachi together with affiliated entities also sell other products to our customers including critical components like flash memory asics and flat panel displays and may be willing to sell their disk drives at a lower margin to advance their overall business strategy to the extent we are not successful competing with captive or independent disk drive manufacturers our results of operations will be adversely affected 

in response to customer demand for highquality highvolume and lowcost disk drives manufacturers of disk drives have had to develop large and in some cases global production facilities with highly developed technological capabilities and internal controls the development of these large production facilities combined with industry consolidation can further increase the intensity of competition 

we also face indirect competition from present and potential customers who evaluate from time to time whether to manufacture their own disk drives or other electronic data storage products 

we also experience competition from other companies that produce alternative storage technologies like flash memory where increasing capacity decreasing cost energy efficiency and improvements in performance ruggedness have resulted in competition with our lower capacity smaller form factor disk drives while this competition has traditionally been in the markets for handheld consumer electronics applications these competitors have announced solid state drives ssds for tablet notebook and enterprise compute applications some of these companies like samsung also sell disk drives certain customers for both notebook and enterprise compute applications are evaluating and may adopt ssds as alternatives to hard drives in certain applications 

volatility of quarterly results—our quarterly results of operations fluctuate sometimes significantly from period to period and may cause our share price to decline 

in the past our quarterly revenue and results of operations have fluctuated sometimes significantly from period to period these fluctuations which we expect to continue may be occasioned by a variety of factors including 

• current uncertainty in global economic conditions may pose a risk to the overall economy • adverse changes in the level of economic activity in the major regions in which we do business 19 

• competitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices by our competitors targeted to encourage shifting of customer demand • delays or problems in our introduction of new products particularly new disk drives with lower cost structures the inability to achieve high production yields or delays in customer qualification or initial product quality issues • changes in purchasing patterns by our distributor customers • increased costs or adverse changes in availability of supplies of raw materials or components • the impact of corporate restructuring activities that we have and may continue to engage in • changes in the demand for the computer systems storage subsystems and consumer electronics that contain our disk drives due to seasonality economic conditions and other factors • changes in purchases from period to period by our primary customers particularly as our competitors are able to introduce and produce in volume competing disk drive solutions or alternative storage technology solutions such as flash memory or ssds • shifting trends in customer demand which when combined with overproduction of particular products particularly when the industry is served by multiple suppliers results in unfavorable supplydemand imbalances • our high proportion of fixed costs including research and development expenses • announcements of new products services or technological innovations by us or our competitors and • adverse changes in the performance of our products as a result we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our revenue and results of operations may not be meaningful and that these comparisons may not be an accurate indicator of our future performance our results of operations in one or more future quarters may fail to meet the expectations of investment research analysts or investors which could cause an immediate and significant decline in the trading price of our ordinary shares 

new product offerings—market acceptance of new product introductions cannot be accurately predicted and our results of operations will suffer if there is less demand for our new products than is anticipated 

we are continually developing new products with the goal that we will be able to introduce technologically advanced and lower cost disk drives into the marketplace ahead of our competitors 

the success of our new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors including market acceptance our ability to manage the risks associated with product transitions the effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand and the risk that our new products will have quality problems or other defects in the early stages of introduction that were not anticipated in the design of those products accordingly we cannot accurately determine the ultimate effect that our new products will have on our results of operations 

in addition the success of our new product introductions is dependent upon our ability to qualify as a primary source of supply with our oem customers in order for our products to be considered by our customers for qualification we must be among the leaders in timetomarket with those new products once a product is accepted for qualification testing any failure or delay in the qualification process or a requirement that we requalify can result in our losing sales to that customer until new products are introduced the limited number of highvolume oems magnifies the effect of missing a product qualification opportunity these risks are further magnified because we expect competitive pressures to result in declining sales eroding prices and declining gross margins on our current generation products 

we cannot assure that we will be among the leaders in timetomarket with new products or that we will be able to successfully qualify new products with our customers in the future 

if we cannot successfully deliver competitive products our future results of operations may be adversely affected 

smaller form factor disk drives—if we do not continue to successfully market smaller form factor disk drives our business may suffer 

the disk drive industry is experiencing significant increases in sales of smaller form factor disk drives for an expanding number of applications in particular notebook computers and consumer electronic devices but also in personal computers and enterprise storage applications our future success will depend on our ability to develop and introduce smaller form factor drives at desired price and capacity points faster than our competitors 

we have experienced competition from other companies that produce alternative storage technologies like solid state or flash memory where increased capacity improving cost energy efficiency and performance ruggedness have resulted in flash memory largely replacing disk drives in handheld applications we believe that the demand for disk drives to store or back up related media content from such handheld devices however continues to grow while this competition has traditionally been limited to the markets for handheld consumer electronics applications these competitors have announced ssds for tablet notebook and enterprise compute applications 

if we do not suitably adapt our product offerings to successfully introduce additional smaller form factor disk drives or alternative storage products based on flash storage technology or if our competitors are successful in achieving customer acceptance of ssd products for tablet notebook and enterprise compute applications then our customers may decrease the amounts of our products that they purchase which would adversely affect our results of operations 

difficulty in predicting quarterly demand—if we fail to predict demand accurately for our products in any quarter we may not be able to recapture the cost of our investments 

the disk drive industry operates on quarterly purchasing cycles with much of the order flow in any given quarter typically coming at the end of that quarter our manufacturing process requires us to make significant productspecific investments in inventory in each quarter for that quarters production since we typically receive the bulk of our orders late in a quarter after we have made our investments there is a risk that our orders will not be sufficient to allow us to recapture the costs of our investment before the products resulting from that investment have become obsolete we cannot assure you that we will be able to accurately predict demand in the future 

the difficulty in forecasting demand also increases the difficulty in anticipating our inventory requirements which may cause us to overproduce finished goods resulting in inventory writeoffs or underproduce finished goods affecting our ability to meet customer requirements additionally the risk of inventory writeoffs could increase if we were to continue to hold higher inventory levels we cannot be certain that we will be able to recover the costs associated with increased inventory 

other factors that may negatively impact our ability to recapture the cost of investments in any given quarter include 

• the impact of variable demand and an aggressive pricing environment for disk drives • the impact of competitive product announcements and possible excess industry supply both with respect to particular disk drive products and with respect to competing alternative storage technology solutions such as ssds in tablet notebook and enterprise compute applications 21 

• our inability to reduce our fixed costs to match sales in any quarter because of our vertical manufacturing strategy which means that we make more capital investments than we would if we were not vertically integrated • dependence on our ability to successfully qualify manufacture and sell in increasing volumes on a costeffective basis and with acceptable quality our disk drive products particularly the new disk drive products with lower cost structures • variations in the cost of components for our products especially during periods when the us dollar is relatively volatile as compared to other currencies • uncertainty in the amount of purchases from our distributor customers who from time to time constitute a large portion of our total sales • our product mix and the related margins of the various products • accelerated reduction in the price of our disk drives due to technological advances andor an oversupply of disk drives in the market and shifting trends in demand which can create supply and demand imbalances • manufacturing delays or interruptions particularly at our manufacturing facilities in china malaysia northern ireland singapore thailand or the united states • limited access to components that we obtain from a single or a limited number of suppliers • the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the cost of producing our products and the effective price of our products to foreign consumers and • operational issues arising out of the increasingly automated nature of our manufacturing processes dependence on supply of components equipment and raw materials—if we experience shortages or delays in the receipt of or cost increases in critical components equipment or raw materials necessary to manufacture our products we may suffer lower operating margins production delays and other material adverse effects 

the cost quality and supply of components certain equipment and raw materials used to manufacture disk drives and key components like recording media and heads are critical to our success the equipment we use to manufacture our products and components is frequently custom made and comes from a few suppliers and the lead times required to obtain manufacturing equipment can be significant particularly important components for disk drives include readwrite heads aluminum or glass substrates for recording media asics spindle motors printed circuit boards and suspension assemblies we rely on sole suppliers or a limited number of suppliers for some of these components that we do not manufacture including aluminum and glass substrates readwrite heads asics spindle motors printed circuit boards and suspension assemblies if our vendors for these components are unable to meet our cost quality and supply requirements we could experience a shortage in supply or an increase in production costs which would adversely affect our results of operations 

certain rare earth elements are critical in the manufacture of our products we purchase components that contain rare earth elements from a number of countries including the peoples republic of china we cannot predict whether any nation will impose regulations quotas or embargoes upon the rare earth elements incorporated into our products that would restrict the worldwide supply of such metals or increase their cost we have experienced increased costs and production delays when we were unable to obtain the necessary equipment or sufficient quantities of some components andor have been forced to pay higher prices or make volume purchase commitments or advance deposits for some components equipment or raw materials that were in short supply in the industry in general if any major supplier were to restrict the supply available to us or increase the cost of the rare earth elements used in our products we 

could experience a shortage in supply or an increase in production costs which would adversely affect our results of operations 

consolidation among component manufacturers may result in some component manufacturers exiting the industry or not making sufficient investments in research to develop new components 

if there is a shortage of or delay in supplying us with critical components equipment or raw materials then 

• it is likely that our suppliers would raise their prices and if we could not pass these price increases to our customers our operating margin would decline • we might have to reengineer some products which would likely cause production and shipment delays make the reengineered products more costly and provide us with a lower rate of return on these products • we would likely have to allocate the components we receive to certain of our products and ship less of others which could reduce our revenues and could cause us to lose sales to customers who could purchase more of their required products from manufacturers that either did not experience these shortages or delays or that made different allocations and • we might be late in shipping products causing potential customers to make purchases from our competitors thus causing our revenue and operating margin to decline we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain critical components in a timely and economic manner 

importance of timetomaturity—our results of operations may depend on our being among the firsttomaturity with new product offerings and achieving sufficient production volume with our new products 

to achieve consistent success with our oem customers it is important that we be an early provider of new types of disk drives featuring leading highquality technology and lower per gigabyte storage cost historically our results of operations have substantially depended upon our ability to be among the firsttomaturity with new product offerings our market share and results of operations in the future may be adversely affected if we fail to 

• consistently maintain our timetomaturity performance with our new products • produce these products in sufficient volume • qualify these products with key customers on a timely basis by meeting our customers performance and quality specifications or • achieve acceptable manufacturing yields quality and costs with these products if the delivery of our products is delayed our oem customers may use our competitors products to meet their production requirements if the delay of our products causes delivery of those oems computer systems into which our products are integrated to be delayed consumers and businesses may purchase comparable products from the oems competitors 

we face the related risk that consumers and businesses may wait to make their purchases if they want to buy a new product that has been shipped or announced but not yet released if this were to occur we may be unable to sell our existing inventory of products that may be less efficient and cost effective compared to new products as a result even if we are among the firsttomaturity with a given product subsequent introductions or announcements by our competitors of new products could cause us to lose revenue and not achieve a positive return on our investment in existing products and inventory 

industry demand—poor global economic conditions and changes in demand for computer systems and storage subsystems may cause in the future a decline in demand for our products 

our disk drives are components in computers computer systems storage subsystems and consumer electronics devices the demand for these products has been volatile during times of poor global economic conditions consumer spending tends to decline and retail demand for personal computers and consumer electronics devices tends to decrease as does enterprise demand for computer systems and storage subsystems moreover unexpected slowdowns in demand for computer systems storage subsystems or consumer electronics devices generally cause sharp declines in demand for disk drive products the decline in consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services and on our financial condition and results of operations 

additional causes of declines in demand for our products in the past have included announcements or introductions of major new operating systems or semiconductor improvements or changes in consumer preferences such as the shift from desktop to notebook computers we believe these announcements and introductions have from time to time caused consumers to defer their purchases and made inventory obsolete whenever an oversupply of disk drives causes participants in our industry to have higher than anticipated inventory levels we experience even more intense price competition from other disk drive manufacturers than usual 

dependence on distributors—we are dependent on sales to distributors and retailers which may increase price erosion and the volatility of our sales 

a substantial portion of our sales has been to distributors of disk drive products certain of our distributors may also market other products that compete with our products product qualification programs in this distribution channel are limited which increases the number of competing products that are available to satisfy demand particularly in times of lengthening product cycles as a result purchasing decisions in this channel are based largely on price terms and product availability sales volumes through this channel are also less predictable and subject to greater volatility than sales to our oem customers in addition deterioration in business and economic conditions could exacerbate price erosion and volatility as distributors lower prices to compensate for lower demand and higher inventory levels our distributors ability to access credit for purposes of funding their operations may also affect purchases of our products by these customers 

if distributors reduce their purchases of our products or prices decline significantly in the distribution channel or if distributors experience financial difficulties or terminate their relationships with us our revenues and results of operations would be adversely affected 

dependence on sales of disk drives in client noncompute applications—our sales of disk drives for client noncompute applications which have contributed significant revenues to our results can experience significant volatility due to seasonal and other factors which could materially adversely impact our future results of operations 

sales of disk drives for client noncompute applications have contributed significant revenues to our results consumer spending on client noncompute has and may continue to deteriorate in many countries and regions due to poor global economic conditions and high levels of unemployment this could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services and on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition the demand for client noncompute products can be even more volatile and unpredictable than the demand for client compute products in some cases our products manufactured for client noncompute applications are uniquely configured for a single customers application which creates a risk of unwanted and unsellable inventory if the anticipated volumes are not realized this potential for unpredictable volatility is increased by the possibility of competing alternative storage technologies like flash memory meeting the customers cost and capacity metrics resulting in a rapid shift in demand from 

our products and disk drive technology generally to alternative storage technologies unpredictable fluctuations in demand for our products or rapid shifts in demand from our products to alternative storage technologies in new client noncompute applications could materially adversely impact our future results of operations 

dependence on sales of disk drives directly to consumers through retail outlets—our sales of disk drives directly to consumers through retail outlets can experience significant volatility due to seasonal and other factors which could materially adversely impact our future results of operations 

we believe that industry demand for storage products in the longterm is increasing due to the proliferation of mediarich digital content in consumer applications and is fuelling increased consumer demand for storage this has led to the expansion of solutions such as external storage products to provide additional storage capacity and to secure data in case of disaster or system failure or to provide independent storage solutions for multiple users in home or small business environments consumer spending on retail sales of our branded solutions has deteriorated in some markets and may continue to do so if poor global economic conditions continue and higher levels of unemployment persist this could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services and on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition such retail sales of our branded solutions traditionally experience seasonal variability in demand with higher levels of demand in the first half of our fiscal year driven by consumer spending in the backtoschool season from late summer to fall and the traditional holiday shopping season from fall to winter additionally our ability to reach such consumers depends on our maintaining effective working relationships with major retailers and distributors failure to anticipate consumer demand for our branded solutions as well as an inability to maintain effective working relationships with retail and online distributors may adversely impact our future results of operations 

importance of controlling operating costs—if we do not control our operating expenses we will not be able to compete effectively in our industry 

our strategy involves to a substantial degree increasing revenue and product volume while at the same time controlling operating expenses if we do not control our operating expenses our ability to compete in the marketplace may be impaired in the past activities to reduce operating costs have included closures and transfers of facilities significant personnel reductions and efforts to increase automation the reduction of personnel and closure of facilities may adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in required volumes to meet customer demand and may result in other disruptions that affect our products and customer service 

impairment charges—we may be required to record additional impairment charges for goodwill andor other longlived assets 

we are required to assess goodwill annually for impairment or on an interim basis whenever events occur or circumstances change such as an adverse change in business climate or a decline in the overall industry that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount we are also required to test other longlived assets including acquired intangible assets and property equipment and leasehold improvements for recoverability and impairment whenever there are indicators of impairment such as an adverse change in business climate 

adverse changes in business conditions could materially impact our estimates of future operations and result in impairment charges to our goodwill or other long lived assets if our goodwill or other longlived assets were to become impaired our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

dependence on key customers—we may be adversely affected by the loss of or reduced delayed or cancelled purchases by one or more of our larger customers 

some of our key customers including hewlettpackard company dell inc and emc corporation account for a large portion of our disk drive revenue while we have longstanding relationships with many of our customers if any of our key customers were to significantly reduce their purchases from us our results of operations would be adversely affected while sales to major customers may vary from period to period a major customer that permanently discontinues or significantly reduces its relationship with us could be difficult to replace in line with industry practice new customers usually require that we pass a lengthy and rigorous qualification process at the customers cost accordingly it may be difficult or costly for us to attract new major customers additionally mergers acquisitions consolidations or other significant transactions involving our customers generally entail risks to our business if a significant transaction involving any of our key customers results in the loss of or reduction in purchases by these key customers it could have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and prospects 

impact of technological change—increases in the areal density of disk drives may outpace customers demand for storage capacity 

the rate of increase in areal density or storage capacity per square inch on a disk may be greater than the increase in our customers demand for aggregate storage capacity particularly in certain market applications like client compute as a result our customers storage capacity needs may be satisfied with lower priced low capacity disk drives these factors could decrease our sales especially when combined with continued price erosion which could adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in electronic data storage products—future changes in the nature of electronic data storage products may reduce demand for traditional disk drive products 

we expect that in the future new personal computing devices and products will be developed some of which such as internet appliances tablet or mobile phones with advanced capabilities or smartphones may not contain a disk drive while we are investing development resources in designing disk drives for these new applications these new applications may have an impact on future demand for disk drive products products using alternative technologies such as flash memory optical storage and other storage technologies are becoming increasingly common and could become a significant source of competition to particular applications of our products which could adversely affect our results of operations 

new product development and technological change—if we do not develop products in time to keep pace with technological changes our results of operations will be adversely affected 

our customers have demanded new generations of disk drive products as advances in computer hardware and software have created the need for improved storage products with features such as increased storage capacity improved performance and reliability and lower cost we and our competitors have developed improved products and we will need to continue to do so in the future such product development requires significant investments in research and development we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully complete the design or introduction of new products in a timely manner that we will be able to manufacture new products in sufficient volumes with acceptable manufacturing yields that we will be able to successfully market these new products or that these products will perform to specifications on a longterm basis in addition the impact of slowing areal density growth may adversely impact our ability to be successful 

when we develop new products with higher capacity and more advanced technology our results of operations may decline because the increased difficulty and complexity associated with producing these products increases the likelihood of reliability quality or operability problems if our products suffer 

increases in failures are of low quality or are not reliable customers may reduce their purchases of our products and our manufacturing rework and scrap costs and service and warranty costs may increase in addition a decline in the reliability of our products may make us less competitive as compared with other disk drive manufacturers or competing technologies 

substantial leverage—our substantial leverage may place us at a competitive disadvantage in our industry 

we are leveraged and have significant debt service obligations our significant debt and debt service requirements could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities for example our high level of debt presents the following risks 

• we are required to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements • our substantial leverage increases our vulnerability to economic downturns and adverse competitive and industry conditions and could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that are less leveraged • our debt service obligations could limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry and could limit our ability to pursue other business opportunities borrow more money for operations or capital in the future and implement our business strategies • our level of debt may restrict us from raising additional financing on satisfactory terms to fund working capital capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements and • covenants in our debt instruments limit our ability to pay future dividends or make other restricted payments and investments in the event that we need to refinance all or a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures we may not be able to obtain terms as favorable as the terms of our existing debt or refinance our existing debt at all if prevailing interest rates or other factors existing at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing then the interest expense relating to the refinanced debt would increase furthermore if any rating agency changes our credit rating or outlook our debt and equity securities could be negatively affected which could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt or raise additional capital 

significant debt service requirements—servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate cash may be affected by factors beyond our control 

our business may not generate cash flow in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay the principal of or interest on our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs including working capital capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements 

our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control we cannot assure you that 

• our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations • we will continue to realize the cost savings revenue growth and operating improvements that result from the execution of our longterm strategic plan or 27 

• future sources of funding will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs if we cannot fund our liquidity needs we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements we cannot assure you that any of these remedies could if necessary be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all or that they would permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations in addition if we incur additional debt the risks associated with our substantial leverage including the risk that we will be unable to service our debt or generate enough cash flow to fund our liquidity needs could intensify 

restrictions imposed by debt covenants—restrictions imposed by our senior secured revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our 10 senior secured secondpriority notes due 2014 may limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in our interest 

our senior secured revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our 10 senior secured secondpriority notes due 2014 the 10 notes impose and the terms of any future debt may impose operating and other restrictions on us subject to qualifications and exceptions our senior secured revolving credit facility and such indenture limit among other things our ability to 

• incur additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred shares • create liens • pay dividends or make distributions in respect of our capital stock • redeem or repurchase capital stock or debt • make certain investments or other restricted payments • sell assets • issue or sell capital stock of subsidiaries • enter into transactions with affiliates • engage to any material extent in business other than our current business and • effect a consolidation or merger the credit agreement that governs our senior secured revolving credit facility contains certain covenants that we must satisfy in order to remain in compliance with the credit agreement including three financial covenants 1 minimum cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments 2 a fixed charge coverage ratio and 3 a net leverage ratio a breach of any of the covenants in our debt agreements including our inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our senior secured revolving credit facility if a condition of default occurs and we are not able to obtain a waiver from the lenders holding a majority of the commitments under our senior secured revolving credit facility the administrative agent of our senior secured revolving credit facility may and at the request of lenders holding a majority of the commitments shall declare all of our outstanding obligations under our senior secured revolving credit facility together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable and may terminate the lenders commitments thereunder cease making further loans and if we cannot repay our outstanding obligation institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets if our outstanding indebtedness were to be accelerated we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full that debt and any potential future indebtedness which would cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline significantly we could also be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 

in addition some of the agreements governing our other debt instruments contain crossdefault provisions that may be triggered by a default under our senior secured revolving credit facility in the event that we default under our senior secured revolving credit facility there could be an event of default under crossdefault provisions for the applicable debt instrument as a result all outstanding obligations under certain of our debt instruments may become immediately due and payable if such acceleration were to occur we may not have adequate funds to satisfy all of our outstanding obligations the lenders could exercise their rights as described above and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 

substantially all of our assets are pledged as collateral to secure certain indebtedness—since substantially all of our assets are used to secure portions of our existing debt obligations we may be limited in our ability to incur additional indebtedness or to provide additional credit support and if we fail to meet our payment or other obligations under certain of our existing debt obligations the lenders thereunder could foreclose on and acquire control of substantially all of our assets 

substantially all our assets and the assets of our significant subsidiaries organized in the united states the cayman islands the netherlands northern ireland and singapore as well as certain assets located in the united states the cayman islands the netherlands northern ireland and singapore owned by other significant subsidiaries and all proceeds therefrom are pledged as security for borrowings under our 10 notes as well as obligations under our hedging agreements cash management arrangements and certain metal leasing arrangements since substantially all of our assets are used to secure portions of our existing debt obligations we have a limited amount of collateral that is available for future secured debt or credit support as a result we may be limited in our ability to incur additional indebtedness or to provide additional credit support for our existing indebtedness in addition our failure to comply with the terms of the indenture governing our 10 notes would entitle the lenders thereunder to declare all funds borrowed thereunder to be immediately due and payable if we were unable to meet these payment obligations the lenders could foreclose on and acquire control of substantially all our assets that serve as collateral 

failure to pay quarterly dividends—our failure to pay quarterly dividends to our shareholders could cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline significantly 

on april 7 2011 we declared a dividend of 018 per share that was paid on june 1 2011 to our shareholders of record as of may 2 2011 on july 20 2011 the board of directors approved a cash dividend of 018 per share which will be payable on august 26 2011 to our shareholders of record as of the close of business on august 5 2011 

our ability to pay quarterly dividends will be subject to among other things our financial position and results of operations available cash and cash flow capital requirements and other factors any reduction or discontinuation of quarterly dividends could cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline significantly moreover in the event our payment of quarterly dividends is reduced or discontinued our failure or inability to resume paying dividends at historical levels could result in a persistently low market valuation of our ordinary shares 

purchase commitments to certain suppliers—if revenues fall or customer demand decreases significantly we may not meet all of our purchase commitments to certain suppliers 

from time to time we enter into longterm noncancelable purchase commitments with certain suppliers in order to secure certain components for the production of our products or to supplement our internal manufacturing capacity for certain components if our actual revenues in the future are lower than our projections or if customer demand decreases significantly below our projections we may not meet all of our purchase commitments with these suppliers as a result it is possible that we will have to shift output from our internal manufacturing facilities to these suppliers or make penaltytype payments under these contracts 

risks associated with future strategic alliances joint ventures or investments—we may not be able to identify suitable strategic alliances acquisitions joint ventures or investment opportunities or successfully acquire and integrate companies that provide complementary products or technologies 

our growth strategy may involve pursuing strategic alliances with making acquisitions of forming joint ventures with or making investments in other companies that are complementary to our business there is substantial competition for attractive strategic alliance acquisition joint venture and investment candidates accordingly we may not be able to identify suitable strategic alliances acquisition joint venture or investment candidates even if we can identify them we cannot assure you that we will be able to partner with acquire or invest in suitable candidates or integrate acquired technologies or operations successfully into our existing technologies and operations moreover our ability to finance potential strategic alliances acquisitions joint ventures or investments will be limited by our high degree of leverage the covenants contained in the indentures that govern our outstanding indebtedness and any agreements governing any other debt we may incur 

if we are successful in forming strategic alliances or acquiring forming joint ventures or making investments in other companies any of these transactions may have an adverse effect on our results of operations particularly while the operations of an acquired business are being integrated it is also likely that integration of acquired companies would lead to the loss of key employees from those companies or the loss of customers of those companies in addition the integration of any acquired companies would require substantial attention from our senior management which may limit the amount of time available to be devoted to our daytoday operations or to the execution of our strategy growth by strategic alliance acquisition joint venture or investment involves an even higher degree of risk to the extent we combine new product offerings and enter new markets in which we have limited experience and no assurance can be given that acquisitions of entities with new or alternative business models will be successfully integrated or achieve their stated objectives 

furthermore the expansion of our business involves the risk that we might not manage our growth effectively that we would incur additional debt to finance these acquisitions or investments that we may have impairment of goodwill or acquired intangible assets associated with these acquisitions and that we would incur substantial charges relating to the writeoff of inprocess research and development similar to that which we incurred in connection with several of our prior acquisitions each of these items could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we could issue additional ordinary shares in connection with future strategic alliances acquisitions joint ventures or investments issuing shares in connection with such transactions would have the effect of diluting your ownership percentage of the ordinary shares and could cause the price of our ordinary shares to decline 

risk of intellectual property litigation—our products may infringe the intellectual property rights of others which may cause us to incur unexpected costs or prevent us from selling our products 

we cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of others we may not be aware of currently filed patent applications that relate to our products or technology if patents are later issued on these applications we may be liable for infringement we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims including claims of alleged infringement of the patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties by us or our customers in connection with their use of our products 

we are currently subject to lawsuits involving intellectual property claims which could cause us to incur significant additional costs or prevent us from selling our products and which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

intellectual property litigation is expensive and timeconsuming regardless of the merits of any claim and could divert our managements attention from operating our business in addition intellectual property lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties due to the complexity of the technical issues involved and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in defending ourselves against intellectual property claims patent litigation has increased due to the current uncertainty of the law and the increasing competition and overlap of product functionality in the field if we were to discover that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of others we would need to obtain licenses from these parties or substantially reengineer our products in order to avoid infringement we might not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms or at all or be able to reengineer our products successfully moreover if we are sued for patent infringement and lose the suit we could be required to pay substantial damages andor be enjoined from using or selling the infringing products or technology any of the foregoing could cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling our products which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition see part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data—note 13 legal environmental and other contingencies of this annual report on form 10k for a description of pending intellectual property proceedings 

system failures—system failures caused by events beyond our control could adversely affect computer equipment and electronic data on which our operations depend 

our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer equipment and the electronic data stored in our databases from damage by among other things earthquake fire natural disaster power loss telecommunications failures unauthorized intrusion and other catastrophic events as our operations become more automated and increasingly interdependent our exposure to the risks posed by these types of events will increase while we continue to improve our disaster recovery processes system failures and other interruptions in our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

economic risks associated with international operations—our international operations subject us to risks related to currency exchange fluctuations longer payment cycles for sales in foreign countries seasonality and disruptions in foreign markets tariffs and duties price controls potential adverse tax consequences increased costs our customers credit and access to capital and healthrelated risks 

we have significant operations in foreign countries including manufacturing facilities sales personnel and customer support operations we have manufacturing facilities in china malaysia northern ireland singapore and thailand in addition to those in the united states a substantial portion of our client compute disk drive assembly occurs in our facility in china 

our international operations are subject to economic risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries including the following 

• disruptions in foreign markets disruptions in financial markets and the deterioration of the underlying economic conditions in the past in some countries including those in asia have had an impact on our sales to customers located in or whose enduser customers are located in these countries • fluctuations in currency exchange rates prices for our products are denominated predominately in us dollars even when sold to customers that are located outside the united states currency instability in asia and other geographic markets may make our products more expensive than products sold by other manufacturers that are priced in the local currency moreover many of the costs associated with our operations located outside the united states are denominated in local 31 

currencies as a consequence the increased strength of local currencies against the us dollar in countries where we have foreign operations would result in higher effective operating costs and potentially reduced earnings from time to time fluctuations in foreign exchange rates have negatively affected our operations and profitability and there can be no assurance that these fluctuations will not adversely affect our operations and profitability in the future 

• longer payment cycles our customers outside of the united states are often allowed longer time periods for payment than our us customers this increases the risk of nonpayment due to the possibility that the financial condition of particular customers may worsen during the course of the payment period • seasonality seasonal reductions in the business activities of our customers during the summer months particularly in europe typically result in lower earnings during those periods • tariffs duties limitations on trade and price controls our international operations are affected by limitations on imports currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations price controls and other restraints on trade in addition the governments of many countries including china malaysia northern ireland singapore and thailand in which we have significant operating assets have exercised and continue to exercise significant influence over many aspects of their domestic economies and international trade • potential adverse tax consequences our international operations create a risk of potential adverse tax consequences including imposition of withholding or other taxes on payments by subsidiaries • increased costs the shipping and transportation costs associated with our international operations are typically higher than those associated with our us operations resulting in decreased operating margins in some foreign countries • credit and access to capital risks our international customers could have reduced access to working capital due to higher interest rates reduced bank lending resulting from contractions in the money supply or the deterioration in the customers or its banks financial condition or the inability to access other financing • global health outbreaks the occurrence of a pandemic disease may adversely impact our operations and some of our key customers such diseases could also potentially disrupt the timeliness and reliability of the distribution network we rely on political risks associated with international operations—our international operations subject us to risks related to political unrest and terrorism 

we have manufacturing facilities in parts of the world that periodically experience political unrest this could disrupt our ability to manufacture important components as well as cause interruptions andor delays in our ability to ship components to other locations for continued manufacture and assembly any such delays or interruptions could result in delays in our ability to fill orders and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition us and international responses to the ongoing hostilities in various regions and the risk of terrorist attacks or hostilities elsewhere in the world could exacerbate these risks 

legal and operational risks associated with international operations—our international operations subject us to risks related to staffing and management legal and regulatory requirements and the protection of intellectual property 

operating outside of the united states creates difficulties associated with staffing and managing our international manufacturing facilities complying with local legal and regulatory requirements and protecting our intellectual property we cannot assure you that we will continue to be found to be 

operating in compliance with applicable customs currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which we may be subject we also cannot assure you that these laws will not be modified 

dependence on key personnel—the loss of key executive officers and employees could negatively impact our business prospects 

our future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued service of key members of management as well as marketing sales and product development personnel the loss of one or more of our key personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we believe our future success will also depend in large part upon our ability to attract retain and further motivate highly skilled management marketing sales and product development personnel we have experienced intense competition for personnel and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our key employees or that we will be successful in attracting assimilating and retaining personnel in the future 

potential governmental action—governmental action against companies located in offshore jurisdictions may lead to a reduction in the demand for our ordinary shares 

recent us federal and state legislation has been proposed and additional legislation may be proposed in the future which if enacted could have an adverse tax impact on either seagate or its shareholders 

securities litigation—significant fluctuations in the market price of our ordinary shares could result in securities class action claims against us 

significant price and value fluctuations have occurred with respect to the publicly traded securities of disk drive companies and technology companies generally the price of our ordinary shares is likely to be volatile in the future in the past following periods of decline in the market price of a companys securities class action lawsuits have often been pursued against that company if similar litigation were pursued against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources which could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

global credit and financial market conditions—deterioration in global credit and financial market conditions could negatively impact the value of our current portfolio of cash equivalents shortterm investments or auction rate securities and our ability to meet our financing objectives 

our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase our shortterm investments consist primarily of readily marketable debt securities with remaining maturities of more than 90 days at the time of purchase our investment policy has as its principal objectives the preservation of principal and maintenance of liquidity we mitigate default risk by investing in highquality investment grade securities limiting the time to maturity and by monitoring the counterparties and underlying obligors closely 

while as of the date of this filing we are not aware of any other material downgrades losses or other significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or shortterm investments or auction rate securities since july 1 2011 no assurance can be given that further deterioration in conditions of the global credit and financial markets would not negatively impact our current portfolio of cash equivalents shortterm investments or auction rate securities or our ability to meet our financing objectives 

environmental regulations—failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the sale and manufacturing of products in certain states and countries may subject us to environmental and other regulations including in some instances the responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling for example the eu has enacted the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment directive which prohibits the use of certain substances in electronic equipment and the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive which obligates parties that place electrical and electronic equipment onto the market in the eu to put a clearly identifiable mark on the equipment register with and report to eu member countries regarding distribution of the equipment and provide a mechanism to takeback and properly dispose of the equipment similar legislation may be enacted in other locations where we manufacture or sell our products although we do not anticipate any material adverse effects based on the nature of our operations and the focus of such legislation we will need to ensure that we comply with these laws and regulations as they are enacted and that our suppliers also comply with these laws and regulations if we fail to timely comply with the legislation our customers may refuse to purchase our products which would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition if we were found to be in violation of these laws or noncompliance with these initiatives or standards of conduct we could be subject to governmental fines liability to our customers and damage to our reputation which would also have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

seasonality—because we experience seasonality in the sales of our products our results of operations will generally be adversely impacted during the second half of our fiscal year 

sales of computer systems storage subsystems and consumer electronics tend to be seasonal and therefore we expect to continue to experience seasonality in our business as we respond to variations in our customers demand for disk drives in particular we anticipate that sales of our products will continue to be lower during the second half of our fiscal year in the client compute and client noncompute market applications of our business this seasonality is partially attributable to the historical trend in our results derived from our customers increased sales of desktop computers notebook computers and consumer electronics during the backtoschool and winter holiday season in the enterprise market our sales are seasonal because of the capital budgeting and purchasing cycles of our end users since our working capital needs peak during periods in which we are increasing production in anticipation of orders that have not yet been received our results of operations will fluctuate seasonally even if the forecasted demand for our products proves accurate furthermore it is difficult for us to evaluate the degree to which this seasonality may affect our business in future periods because of the rate and unpredictability of product transitions and new product introductions particularly in the client noncompute market as well as macroeconomic conditions 

volatile public markets—the price of our ordinary shares may be volatile and could decline significantly 

the stock market in general and the market for technology stocks in particular has recently experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of companies if these market or industrybased fluctuations continue the trading price of our ordinary shares could decline significantly independent of our actual operating performance and you could lose all or a substantial part of your investment the market price of our ordinary shares could fluctuate significantly in response to several factors including among others 

• general uncertainty in stock market conditions occasioned by global economic conditions negative financial news and the continued instability of several large financial institutions • actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations 34 

• announcements of innovations new products or significant price reductions by us or our competitors including those competitors who offer alternative storage technology solutions • our failure to meet the performance estimates of investment research analysts • the timing of announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts or acquisitions • general stock market conditions • the occurrence of major catastrophic events • changes in financial estimates by investment research analysts • changes in the credit ratings of our indebtedness by rating agencies and • the sale of our ordinary shares held by certain equity investors or members of management risks related to our pending strategic alignment with samsung 

we will not be able to complete the strategic alignment with samsung unless we receive the requisite regulatory approvals or the regulatory approvals may contain burdensome conditions 

we have recently announced the entry into an asset purchase agreement with samsung electronics co ltd samsung pursuant to which we agreed to acquire certain assets and assume certain liabilities of samsung relating to the research and development manufacture and sale of hard disk drives and to enter into certain related agreements in connection therewith including an intellectual property agreement a patent crosslicense agreement a disk drive supply agreement a nand flash memory supply agreement and a shareholder agreement the purchase price for these assets consists of 6875 million in cash and approximately 452 million of our ordinary shares under the terms of the asset purchase agreement the transactions contemplated thereby are subject to the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 as amended clearance by the european commission and the receipt of certain other similar regulatory approvals from the republic of korea japan and the peoples republic of china while we intend to consummate the transactions contemplated by the asset purchase agreement and related agreements as soon as practicable after such regulatory approvals are obtained there can be no assurance that we will obtain such approvals when expected or at all which could among other things delay or prevent us from completing the transactions contemplated by the asset purchase agreement and related agreements or restrict our ability to realize the expected financial and strategic goals of the transactions contemplated thereby in certain specified circumstances we must pay samsung a termination fee of 725 million generally if the transaction has not been consummated and the requisite regulatory approvals have not been obtained by the expiration date of december 31 2011 which may be extended in certain circumstances to march 31 2012 if regulatory approvals have been obtained but the transaction has not been consummated by the expiration date then in certain specified circumstances we must pay samsung a termination fee of 825 million generally if we are in breach of the agreement and legal remedies are not awarded to samsung 

in addition the governmental entities from which these approvals are required may impose conditions on the completion of the transaction or require changes to the terms of the strategic alignment while we do not currently expect that any such conditions or changes would be imposed there can be no assurance that there will not be and such conditions or changes could have the effect of jeopardizing or delaying completion of the transaction or reducing its anticipated benefits if we agree to any material conditions in order to obtain any approvals required to complete the strategic alignment the business and results of operations of the combined company may be adversely affected 

if we do not realize the expected benefits of our strategic alignment with samsung our business and financial condition may be materially impaired 

we may not achieve the desired benefits from our strategic alignment with samsung if we cannot successfully integrate the assets we acquire from samsung into our operations we may experience negative consequences to our business financial condition or results of operations the integration of the assets that we acquire from samsung into our business will involve a number of risks including but not limited to 

• diversion of senior managements attention from the management of daily operations to the integration of the acquired assets into our business • the potential that we do not successfully integrate the employees that we hire from samsungs hard disk drive business into our business • the potential loss of key customers or suppliers of samsungs hard disk drive business who do not choose to do business with us • the potential that key customers do not accept new products of the combined company • the potential that we do not successfully coordinate sales and marketing efforts to communicate the capabilities of the combined company • potential revenue attrition in excess of anticipated levels • the potential that we do not qualify the combined companys products as a primary source of supply with oem customers on a timely basis or at all • the risk of higher than anticipated costs in continuing support and development of acquired products • difficulties and uncertainties in achieving anticipated cost reductions and operational synergies • potential difficulties integrating manufacturing and design processes and controls • potential difficulties integrating and harmonizing financial reporting systems and • potential incompatibility of technology and systems even if we are able to successfully integrate the assets that we acquire from samsung into our business we may not be able to realize the cost savings synergies and growth that we anticipate from this transaction in the timeframe we currently expect and the costs of achieving these benefits may be higher than we currently expect because of a number of risks including but not limited to 

• the possibility that the transaction may not further our business strategy as we expected • our operating results or financial condition may be adversely impacted by liabilities that we assume in the transaction and • the risk of intellectual property disputes with respect to the acquired assets as a result of these risks the transaction may not contribute to our earnings as we expected we may not achieve expected cost synergies when expected or at all and we may not achieve the other anticipated strategic and financial benefits of this transaction 

the issuance of our ordinary shares to samsung in connection with the asset purchase agreement will dilute the holdings of our existing shareholders 

in connection with the asset purchase agreement with samsung we expect to issue approximately 452 million shares of our ordinary shares to samsung representing over 10 of our outstanding ordinary 

shares we will be issuing these shares from our authorized but unissued share reserves and this issuance will have the effect of diluting the ownership of our existing shareholders 

we expect the integration of seagate and samsungs hard drive business will result in revenue attrition significant accounting charges and increased capital expenditures that will have an adverse effect on the results and financial condition of the combined company 

the financial results of the combined company may be adversely affected by cash expenditures and noncash charges incurred in connection with the strategic alignment in addition to the anticipated cash expenditures we expect significant noncash charges including those associated with the amortization of intangible assets we anticipate that the majority of these cash expenditures and noncash charges will occur in the 12 months following the closing of the combination and will reduce earnings of the combined enterprise in addition the combined company is likely to incur revenue attrition as a result of the revenue attrition capital expenditures and charges described above the operating results and financial condition of the combined company may be adversely affected after the consummation of the strategic alignment particularly in the first year following the closing 

the announcement and pendency of the strategic alignment could cause disruptions in the businesses of seagate and samsung which could have an adverse effect on their respective business and financial results and consequently on the combined company 

seagate and samsung have operated and until the completion of the strategic alignment will continue to operate independently uncertainty about the effect of the strategic alignment on employees customers distributors and suppliers may have an adverse effect on seagate and samsung and consequently on the combined company these uncertainties may impair seagates and samsungs ability to retain and motivate key personnel and could cause customers distributors suppliers and others with whom each company deals to seek to change existing business relationships which may materially and adversely affect their respective businesses due to the materiality standards agreed to by the parties in the agreement seagate and samsung may be obligated to consummate the transaction in spite of the adverse effects resulting from the disruption of seagates and samsungs ongoing businesses furthermore this disruption could adversely affect the combined companys ability to maintain relationships with customers distributors suppliers and employees after the transaction or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the transaction for example in many instances seagate and samsung serve the same customers and some of these customers may decide it is desirable to have additional or different suppliers reducing the combined companys share of the market revenues that may have ordinarily been received by seagate or samsung may be delayed until or after the transaction is completed or not earned at all and cost reductions that would ordinarily have been achieved might be delayed or not achieved at all whether or not the transaction is completed moreover efforts to integrate samsungs hard drive business into seagates operations will also divert management attention and resources these integration matters could have an adverse effect on each of seagate and samsung each of these events could adversely affect samsung in the near term and the combined company if the transaction is completed 

failure to complete the merger could negatively impact the stock prices and the future business and financial results of seagate 

if the strategic alignment is not completed the ongoing business of seagate may be adversely affected and seagate will be subject to a number of risks including the following 

• seagate will be required to pay samsung a termination fee as described above • seagate will be required to pay certain costs relating to the transaction such as legal accounting financial advisor and related fees whether or not the transaction is completed and 37 

• matters relating to the transaction including integration planning may require substantial commitments of time and resources by seagate management which could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to seagate in each case without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the transaction if the strategic alignment is not completed these risks may materialize and may adversely affect seagates business financial results and stock price

we produce a broad range of disk drive products addressing enterprise applications where our products are designed for enterprise servers mainframes and workstations client compute applications where our products are designed for desktop and notebook computers and client noncompute applications where our products are designed for a wide variety of end user devices such as digital video recorders dvrs personal data backup systems portable external storage systems and digital media systems in addition to manufacturing and selling disk drives we provide data storage services for small to mediumsized businesses including online backup data protection and recovery solutions

business overview 

our industry is characterized by several trends and factors that have a material impact on our strategic planning financial condition and results of operations 

demand trends for disk drives the total available market tam for hard disk drives in the fiscal year 2011 was approximately 657 million units an increase of 4 from the prior fiscal year the average capacity per drive shipped by the industry continued to increase and reached approximately 560 gigabytes per unit in the last quarter of the fiscal year which represents an increase of 34 year over year overall storage demand increased approximately 40 year over year we believe that continued growth in digital content requires increasingly higher storage capacity in order to store aggregate host distribute manage back up and use such content which we believe will continue to result in increased demand for disk drive products in addition we believe the continued increased demand for disk drives in developed countries as well as in emerging economies reflects the demand for realtime access to rich data and content driven by the impact of a highly mobile and increasingly connected user base we believe these trends will continue as computing architectures evolve to serve the growing commercial and consumer user base throughout the world 

historically the electronic data storage industry has introduced alternative technologies that directly compete with hard disk drives ssds using nand flash memory are a potential alternative to disk drives in certain applications such as consumer handheld devices tablets and portable external storage however we believe that in the foreseeable future the traditional enterprise and client compute markets that require high capacity storage solutions as well as the data intensive client noncompute markets will continue to 

be best served by hard disk drives based on the industrys ability to deliver reliable energy efficient and cost effective mass storage devices 

disk drives for enterprise storage we define enterprise storage as disk drives designed for mission critical applications and nearline applications 

mission critical applications are defined as applications that are vital to the operation of enterprises requiring high performance and high reliability disk drives we expect the market for mission critical enterprise storage solutions to continue to be driven by enterprises moving network traffic to dedicated storage area networks in an effort to reduce network complexity and increase energy savings we believe that this transition will lead to an increased demand for more energy efficient smaller form factor disk drives these solutions are comprised principally of high performance enterprise class disk drives with sophisticated firmware and communications technologies 

nearline applications are defined as applications that are capacityintensive and require high capacity and energy efficient disk drives featuring lower costs per gigabyte we expect such applications which include storage for cloud computing and backup services will continue to grow and drive demand for disk drives designed with these attributes 

we believe the tam for enterprise disk drives for the fiscal year 2011 was approximately 55 million units an increase of 16 compared to the prior fiscal year we believe that the increase in the tam from fiscal year 2010 was driven by enterprises moving network traffic to dedicated storage area networks in an effort to reduce network complexity and increase energy savings 

ssd storage applications have been introduced as a potential alternative to redundant system startup or boot disk drives in addition enterprises are gradually adopting ssds in applications where rapid processing andor energy efficiency is required the timing of significant adoption of ssds is dependent on enterprises weighing the cost effectiveness and other benefits of mission critical enterprise disk drives against the perceived performance benefits of ssds 

disk drives for client compute we define client compute applications as disk drives designed for the traditional desktop and mobile compute applications we believe that the client compute tam for the fiscal year 2011 was approximately 483 million units a decrease of 1 compared to prior fiscal year we believe that the increase in demand resulting from growing economies of certain countries and the continued proliferation of digital content will drive the demand for the client compute market 

disk drives for client noncompute we define client noncompute applications as disk drives designed for consumer electronic devices and disk drives used for external storage and networkattached storage nas disk drives designed for consumer electronic devices are primarily used in applications such as dvrs that require a higher capacity lower costpergigabyte storage solution disk drives for external and nas devices are designed for purposes such as personal data backup and portable external storage and to augment storage capacity in the consumers current desktop notebook tablet or dvr client noncompute applications also include devices designed to display digital media in the home theater we believe the proliferation of high definition and mediarich digital content will continue to create increasing consumer demand for higher storage solutions as the proliferation of nonclient compute applications that require minimal storage such as tablets continues ssds could become more competitive within the client compute market in the future 

we believe the client noncompute tam in the fiscal year 2011 was approximately 119 million units an increase of 20 from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the strength of the retail market in asia pacific during most of the fiscal year 

industry supply balance 

from time to time the industry has experienced periods of imbalance between supply and demand to the extent that the disk drive industry builds capacity based on expectations of demand that do not 

materialize price erosion may become more pronounced conversely during periods where demand exceeds supply price erosion is generally muted for the first half of fiscal year 2011 our industry experienced a period of relative balance between supply and demand while we believe there was unmet demand in the last quarter of fiscal year 2011 due to a reaction to possible supply chain disruptions stemming from the earthquake and tsunami in japan the industry returned to a relatively balanced supply environment at the end of the fiscal year 

suppliers of components and industry constraints 

due to industry consolidation there are a limited number of independent suppliers of components such as recording heads and media available to disk drive manufacturers vertically integrated disk drive manufacturers who manufacture their own components are less dependent on external component suppliers than less vertically integrated disk drive manufacturers we believe the supply chain was generally tight for the industry during most of fiscal year 2011 

commodity and other manufacturing costs 

the production of disk drives requires rare earth elements precious metals scarce alloys and other industrial commodities which are subject to fluctuations in prices and the supply of which has at times been constrained during the latter part of fiscal year 2011 the industry experienced significant increases in the costs of rare earth elements which are used in magnets as well as in the process for polishing glass substrates in addition to increased costs of components and commodities volatility in fuel costs may also increase our costs related to commodities manufacturing and freight as a result we may increase our use of ocean shipments to help offset any increase in freight costs 

price erosion 

our industry has been characterized by price declines for disk drive products with comparable capacity performance and feature sets likeforlike products price declines for likeforlike products price erosion are more pronounced during periods of 

• economic contraction or industry consolidation in which competitors may use discounted pricing to attempt to maintain or gain market share • few new product introductions when multiple competitors have comparable or alternative product offerings • temporary imbalances between industry supply and demand and • seasonally weaker demand which may cause excess supply disk drive manufacturers typically attempt to offset price erosion with an improved mix of disk drive products characterized by higher capacity better performance and additional feature sets andor product cost reductions 

we expect price erosion in our industry to continue to remain competitive we believe it is necessary for industry participants to continue to introduce new product offerings that utilize advanced technologies ahead of the competition in order to take advantage of potentially higher initial profit margins and reduced cost structures on these new products 

product life cycles and changing technology 

our industry has been characterized by significant advances in technology which have contributed to rapid product life cycles as a result success in our industry has been dependent to a large extent on the ability to be the firsttomarket with new products allowing those disk drive manufacturers who introduce new products first to benefit from improved mix favorable profit margins and less pricing pressure until comparable products are introduced also because our industry is characterized by continuous price 

erosion the existence of rapid product life cycles has necessitated quick achievement of product cost effectiveness changing technology also necessitates ongoing investments in research and development which may be difficult to recover due to rapid product life cycles and economic declines further there is a continued need to successfully execute product transitions and new product introductions as factors such as quality reliability and manufacturing yields become of increasing competitive importance 

seasonality 

the disk drive industry traditionally experiences seasonal variability in demand with higher levels of demand in the second half of the calendar year this seasonality is driven by consumer spending in the backtoschool season from late summer to fall and the traditional holiday shopping season from fall to winter in addition corporate demand is typically higher during the second half of the calendar year however with volatility in fuel costs the industry may be experiencing higher levels of demand earlier in the calendar year as customers attempt to take advantage of less expensive modes of transportation which generally require longer lead times 

fiscal year 2011 summary 

revenues for fiscal year 2011 were 110 billion which represented a 4 decrease in revenues from 114 billion in the prior fiscal year gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased to 20 from 28 in the prior fiscal year we shipped 199 million units during fiscal year 2011 which represents 3 growth over the prior fiscal year the decline in revenue reflects the cumulative effect of the competitive pricing environment the industry experienced during the middle of calendar year 2010 partially offset by an industrywide supply constraint experienced in the second half of fiscal year 2011 in what we believed to be a reaction to possible supply chain disruptions stemming from the earthquake and tsunami in japan the decline in gross margin reflects the effects of price erosion as well as the timing in which we were able to achieve increased manufacturing yields 

we generated operating cash flow of 13 billion used approximately 822 million to repurchase 568 million of our ordinary shares and used 843 million for capital expenditures in 2011 we issued 13 billion in new longterm debt and we repaid approximately 377 million in existing longterm debt 

pending transaction with samsung 

on april 19 2011 we entered into an asset purchase agreement with samsung a company organized under the laws of the republic of korea pursuant to which we will acquire certain assets and assume certain liabilities of samsung relating to the research and development manufacture and sale of harddisk drives under the terms of the agreement samsung will receive consideration comprised of 6875 million in cash and approximately 452 million of our ordinary shares 

the agreement has no financing contingencies and is subject to customary closing conditions including review by us and international regulators the agreement contains certain termination rights for samsung and provides that a specified fee must be paid by us to samsung in connection with certain termination events in certain specified circumstances we must pay samsung a termination fee of 725 million generally if the transaction has not been consummated and the requisite regulatory approvals have not been obtained by the expiration date of december 31 2011 which may be extended in certain circumstances to march 31 2012 if regulatory approvals have been obtained but the transaction has not been consummated by the expiration date then in certain specified circumstances we must pay samsung a termination fee of 825 million generally if we are in breach of the agreement and legal remedies are not awarded to samsung 

on may 20 2011 we received a request for additional information from the us federal trade commission the ftc in connection with the ftcs review of the pending transaction on may 30 2011 we received notification from the european commission the ec that the ec has decided to seek more information regarding the pending transaction we are in the process of gathering information to 

respond to both the ftc and the ec however we continue to believe the transaction will close by the end of calendar year 2011 

results of operations 

the following table summarizes information from our consolidated statements of operations by dollars and as a percentage of revenue 



  



the following table summarizes information regarding volume shipments average selling prices asps and revenues by channel and geography 



fiscal year 2011 compared to fiscal year 2010 

revenue 



revenue in fiscal year 2011 decreased approximately 4 or 424 million from fiscal year 2010 units shipped increased 3 or 6 million units from fiscal year 2010 this decrease in revenue was due to the cumulative effect of the competitive pricing environment the industry experienced partially offset by industrywide supply constraints 

we maintain various sales programs such as pointofsale rebates sales price adjustments and price protection aimed at increasing customer demand we exercise judgment in formulating the underlying estimates related to distributor and retail inventory levels sales program participation and customer claims submittals in determining the provision for such programs sales programs recorded as contra revenue were approximately 8 and 6 of our gross revenue for fiscal years 2011 and 2010 respectively 

gross margin 



for fiscal year 2011 gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased to 20 from 28 in the prior fiscal year primarily due to price erosion in addition gross margin was negatively impacted by delays in ramping to maturity for new products which unfavorably affected our manufacturing yields 

operating expenses 



product development expense product development expenses for fiscal year 2011 were relatively flat from fiscal year 2010 reflecting a 28 million decrease in variable performancebased compensation offset by an 18 million increase in spending for new programs and an 8 million decrease in research grants 

marketing and administrative expense the increase in marketing and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2011 compared to fiscal year 2010 was due to a 13 million increase related to samsung acquisition expenses 10 million increase in litigation related expenses and a net 11 million reduction in total compensation expenses part of which included a 23 million decrease in variable performancebased compensation 

amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles for fiscal year 2011 decreased approximately 93 from fiscal year 2010 as certain intangibles relating to the metalincs inc acquisitions have been fully amortized 

restructuring and other net during fiscal year 2011 we recorded restructuring and other charges of 18 million primarily associated with previously announced restructuring activities restructuring and other net decreased approximately 48 million when compared to the prior fiscal year which included a 39 million charge for our amk restructuring plan announced in august 2009 and an 18 million charge related to our pittsburgh pennsylvania facility 

impairment of longlived assets during fiscal year 2011 we did not record any impairment charge related to our longlived assets impairment of longlived assets decreased approximately 57 million when compared to the prior fiscal year which included an impairment charge to adjust the carrying value of certain assets held for sale to their estimated fair value less cost to sell 

other income expense net 



the change in other expense net for fiscal year 2011 compared to fiscal year 2010 was primarily due to a 40 million increase in interest expense resulting from higher average debt balances and 24 million in losses related to the redemption of debt 

income taxes 



we recorded an income tax provision of 68 million for fiscal year 2011 compared to an income tax benefit of 40 million for fiscal year 2010 our fiscal year 2011 provision for income taxes included nonus income taxes recorded for increases in income tax reserves for nonus income tax positions taken in prior fiscal years partially offset by tax benefits recorded for the release of income tax reserves associated with settlements of income tax audits and the expiration of certain statutes of limitation our fiscal year 2010 income tax benefit included 55 million of deferred tax benefit from the reversal of a portion of the us valuation allowance recorded in earlier years 

our irish tax resident parent holding company owns various us and nonus subsidiaries that operate in multiple nonirish tax jurisdictions our worldwide operating income is either subject to varying rates of tax or is exempt from tax due to tax holidays or tax incentive programs we operate under in malaysia singapore switzerland and thailand these tax holidays or incentives are scheduled to expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2020 

our income tax provision recorded for fiscal year 2011 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying the irish statutory rate of 25 to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i tax benefits related to nonus earnings generated in jurisdictions that are subject to tax holidays or tax incentive programs and are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of ireland ii income tax expense related to intercompany transactions iii a decrease in valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets and iv nonus losses with no tax benefit our benefit for income taxes recorded for the comparative fiscal year ended july 2 2010 differed from the provision benefit for income taxes that would be derived by applying the irish statutory rate of 25 to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i tax benefits related to nonus earnings generated in jurisdictions that are subject to tax holidays or tax incentive programs and are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of ireland ii a decrease in valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets iii nonus losses with no tax benefit and iv tax expense related to intercompany transactions 

based on our nonus ownership structure and subject to i potential future increases in our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and ii a future change in our intention to indefinitely reinvest earnings from our subsidiaries outside of ireland we anticipate that our effective tax rate in future periods will generally be less than the irish statutory rate 

at july 1 2011 our deferred tax asset valuation allowance was approximately 11 billion 

at july 1 2011 we had net deferred tax assets of 462 million the realization of 455 million of these deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on our ability to generate sufficient us and certain nonus taxable income in future periods although realization is not assured we believe that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable however may increase or decrease in subsequent periods when we reevaluate the underlying basis for our estimates of future us and certain nonus taxable income 

approximately 364 million and 90 million of our us net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards respectively are subject to an aggregate annual limitation of 45 million pursuant to us tax law 

as of july 1 2011 and july 2 2010 we had approximately 128 million and 115 million respectively in unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties the unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would impact the effective tax rate were 128 million and 115 million as of july 1 2011 and july 2 2010 respectively subject to certain future valuation allowance reversals 

it is our policy to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for taxes on the consolidated statements of operations during fiscal year 2011 we recognized a net expense for interest and penalties of less than 1 million as compared to a net benefit of 1 million and 6 million during fiscal year 2010 and fiscal year 2009 respectively as of july 1 2011 we had 15 million of accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits which remain unchanged from fiscal year 2010 

during the fiscal year ended july 1 2011 our unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties increased by approximately 13 million primarily due to i reductions associated with the expiration of certain statutes of limitation of 10 million ii reductions associated with effectively settled positions of 21 million iii increases associated with the election to expense foreign tax credits of 1 million iv increases in current year unrecognized tax benefits of 13 million v increases in prior year of unrecognized tax benefits of 26 million and vi increases from other activity including nonus exchange losses of 4 million 

during the 12 months beginning july 2 2011 we expect to reduce our unrecognized tax benefits by approximately 10 million as a result of the expiration of certain statutes of limitation and resolution of issues with relevant authorities we do not believe it is reasonably possible that other unrecognized tax benefits will materially change in the next 12 months 

we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions globally and are required to file us federal us state and nonus income tax returns in may 2011 the us internal revenue service irs completed its field examination of our us federal income tax returns for fiscal years ending in 2005 through 2007 the irs issued a revenue agents report and proposed certain adjustments we are currently contesting certain of these proposed adjustments through the irs appeals office we believe that the resolution of these disputed issues will have no material impact on our financial statements 

with respect to us state and nonus income tax returns we are generally no longer subject to tax examinations for years prior to fiscal year 2003 we are also no longer subject to tax examination of us federal income tax returns for years prior to fiscal year 2005 

fiscal year 2010 compared to fiscal year 2009 

revenue 



revenue in fiscal year 2010 increased approximately 16 or 16 billion from fiscal year 2009 primarily due to an 18 increase in the total number of disk drives shipped this increase in revenue reflects an industrywide supply constraint experienced in the first half of fiscal year 2010 and a relatively balanced supply and demand environment during the march 2010 quarter resulting in muted price erosion in the june 2010 quarter industry supply exceeded demand and resulted in an increase in price erosion to levels typical of a june quarter 

sales programs recorded as contra revenue were approximately 6 and 12 of our gross revenue for fiscal years 2010 and 2009 respectively 

gross margin 



for fiscal year 2010 gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased to 28 from 14 in the fiscal year 2009 primarily as a result of an 18 increase in drive shipments muted price erosion a more costeffective product mix and a substantial improvement in manufacturing capacity utilization 

operating expenses 



product development expense product development expenses for fiscal year 2010 decreased approximately 8 from fiscal year 2009 primarily due to restructuring and other cost reduction efforts and the effect of an additional week of compensation expenses in fiscal year 2009 which was a 53week fiscal year these cost reduction efforts resulted in decreases of 66 million in headcount related expenses in fiscal year 2010 38 million due to the cessation of certain product development activities and 26 million due to the nonrecurrence of accelerated depreciation expense related to the closure of our pittsburgh pennsylvania facility these decreases were partially offset by increases of 48 million for variable performancebased compensation expense recorded in fiscal year 2010 compared to none in fiscal year 2009 and a 16 million benefit related to our deferred compensation plan recorded in fiscal year 2009 

marketing and administrative expense marketing and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2010 decreased approximately 19 from fiscal year 2009 primarily due to restructuring and other cost reduction efforts and the effect of an additional week of compensation expenses in fiscal year 2009 which was a 53week fiscal year these cost reduction efforts resulted in decreases of 69 million in headcount related expenses 26 million in advertising costs and 29 million in legal expenses these decreases were partially offset by increases of 28 million for variable performancebased compensation expense recorded in fiscal year 2010 compared to none in fiscal year 2009 and a 9 million benefit related to our deferred compensation plan recorded in fiscal year 2009 

amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles for fiscal year 2010 decreased approximately 51 from fiscal year 2009 as certain intangibles relating to the maxtor corporation maxtor and metalincs inc acquisitions have been fully amortized 

restructuring and other net during fiscal year 2010 we recorded restructuring and other charges of 66 million mainly comprised of charges related to our amk restructuring plan announced in august 2009 

and additional restructuring charges related to our pittsburgh pennsylvania facility and facilities acquired as a part of the maxtor acquisition 

restructuring and other net decreased approximately 144 million in fiscal year 2010 when compared to the fiscal year 2009 which include restructuring plans announced in january and may 2009 that were intended to realign our cost structure with the fiscal year 2009 macroeconomic business environment 

impairment of goodwill and other longlived assets net of recoveries during fiscal year 2010 we committed to a plan to sell certain equipment related to certain research activities that had ceased in connection with this plan we reclassified these assets as held for sale and recorded a net impairment charge of approximately 57 million to adjust the carrying value of these assets to the estimated fair value less cost to sell 

impairment of goodwill and other longlived assets net of recoveries decreased approximately 22 billion in fiscal year 2010 when compared to the fiscal year 2009 due to nonrecurring 23 billion impairment charge we recorded in fiscal year 2009 as a result of the significant adverse change to our business climate 

other income expense net 



the change in other income expense net for fiscal year 2010 compared to fiscal year 2009 was primarily due to a 31 million increase in interest expense resulting from higher average borrowing costs a decrease in gains from foreign currency remeasurements of 15 million a 13 million writedown of an equity investment in fiscal year 2010 a 12 million decrease in interest income as a result of lower yields on our cash and investments and an 8 million nonrecurring gain recognized on the sale of an equity investment in fiscal year 2009 these were partially offset by a 44 million loss related to our deferred compensation plan assets recorded in fiscal year 2009 

income taxes 



during fiscal year ended july 2 2010 an enacted legislative change in us tax law was taken into account in computing our income tax provision the worker homeownership and business assistance act of 2009 was enacted on november 6 2009 this law allowed us to elect an increased carryback period for net operating losses incurred in 2008 or 2009 from two years to three four or five years at our option we recorded an 11 million income tax benefit as a result of the increased carryback period 

we recorded an income tax benefit of 40 million for fiscal year 2010 compared to a provision for income taxes of 311 million for fiscal year 2009 our fiscal year 2009 provision for income taxes included 271 million of income tax expense recorded in the second quarter associated with an increase in our valuation allowance for us deferred tax assets related to a reduction in our forecasted us taxable income 

in connection with our previously announced plans to move our corporate headquarters to ireland we initiated certain prereorganization steps which resulted in our existing cayman parent holding company 

becoming an irish tax resident in fiscal year 2010 our irish tax resident parent holding company owns various us and nonus subsidiaries that operate in multiple nonirish taxing jurisdictions our worldwide operating income is either subject to varying rates of tax or is exempt from tax due to tax holidays or tax incentive programs we operate under in china malaysia singapore switzerland and thailand these tax holidays or incentives are scheduled to expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2020 

since we became an irish tax resident in fiscal year 2010 the irish statutory rate of 25 is used for purposes of the reconciliation between the provision for income taxes at the statutory rate and our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2009 a notional 35 statutory rate was used 

our income tax benefit recorded for fiscal year 2010 differed from the provision benefit for income taxes that would be derived by applying the irish statutory rate of 25 to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i tax benefits related to nonus earnings generated in jurisdictions that are subject to tax holidays or tax incentive programs and are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of ireland ii a decrease in valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets iii nonus losses with no tax benefit and iv tax expense related to intercompany transactions our provision for income taxes recorded for the comparative fiscal year ended july 3 2009 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying a notional us 35 rate to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i nondeductible goodwill impairments ii an increase in our valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets iii nonus losses with no tax benefit iv tax benefits related to tax holiday and tax incentive programs and v tax expense related to intercompany transactions

liquidity sources 

our primary sources of liquidity as of july 1 2011 consisted of 1 approximately 32 billion in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments 2 cash we expect to generate from operations and 3 a 350 million senior secured revolving credit facility we also had 102 million in restricted cash and investments of which 84 million was related to our employee deferred compensation liabilities under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan 

on january 18 2011 seagate technology plc and its subsidiary seagate hdd entered into a credit agreement which provides for a 350 million senior secured revolving credit facility seagate technology plc and certain of its material subsidiaries fully and unconditionally guarantee on a senior secured basis the revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility matures in january 2015 the revolving credit facility is available for cash borrowings and for the issuance of letters of credit up to a sublimit of 75 million as of july 1 2011 no borrowings have been drawn under the revolving credit facility and 4 million had been utilized for letters of credit the line of credit is available for borrowings subject to compliance with financial covenants and other customary conditions to borrowing 

the credit agreement that governs our revolving credit facility contains certain covenants that we must satisfy in order to remain in compliance with the credit agreement including three financial covenants 1 minimum amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities 2 a fixed charge coverage ratio 

and 3 a net leverage ratio as of july 1 2011 we are in compliance with all covenants including the financial ratios that we are required to maintain 

we believe that our sources of cash will be sufficient to fund our operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months 

cash requirements and commitments 

our liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital research and development and capital expenditure needs to fund scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness and to fund our dividend our ability to fund these requirements will depend on our future cash flows which are determined by future operating performance and therefore subject to prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and financial business and other factors some of which are beyond our control 

on july 20 2011 we announced that our board of directors approved a cash dividend of 018 per share which will be payable on august 26 2011 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on august 5 2011 

in fiscal year 2011 we issued 13 billion in longterm debt we intend to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes which may include the repayment andor repurchase of a portion of our outstanding indebtedness capital expenditures and investments in our business 

as of july 1 2011 we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our debt agreements based on our current outlook we expect to be in compliance with the covenants of our debt agreements over the next 12 months 

the carrying value of our longterm debt as of july 1 2011 and july 2 2010 was 35 billion and 25 billion respectively the table below presents the principal amounts of our outstanding longterm debt in order of maturity 



during fiscal year 2011 we repurchased approximately 569 million of our ordinary shares see item 5 market for registrants shares related shareholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities—repurchases of our equity securities 

we expect the pending transaction with samsung to close by the end of calendar 2011 the purchase price for this transaction includes cash consideration of 6875 million which we are obligated to pay upon closing we currently expect to fund this transaction with our current sources of liquidity and cash from operations 

for fiscal year 2012 we expect capital investment to be at or below the low end of our targeted range of 68 of revenue we require substantial amounts of cash to fund scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness future capital expenditures and any increased working capital requirements we will continue to evaluate and manage the retirement and replacement of existing debt and associated obligations including the issuance of new debt securities exchanging existing debt securities for other debt securities and retiring debt pursuant to privately negotiated transactions open market purchases or otherwise in addition we may selectively pursue strategic alliances acquisitions and investments which may require additional capital 

contractual obligations and commitments 

our contractual cash obligations and commitments as of july 1 2011 have been summarized in the table below 



1 included in longterm debt for fiscal year 2012 is the principal amount of 559 million related to our 6375 notes 2 includes total future minimum rent expense under noncancelable leases for both occupied and vacated facilities rent expense is shown net of sublease income 3 purchase obligations are defined as contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services which are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms 

as of july 1 2011 we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits and an accrual for the payment of related interest totaling 75 million 8 million of which is expected to be settled within one year outside of one year we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlement with a taxing authority will occur 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of july 1 2011 we did not have any material offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of regulation sk 

critical accounting policies 

the methods estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements the sec has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are highly uncertain at the time of estimation 

based on this definition our most critical policies include establishment of sales program accruals establishment of warranty accruals accounting for income taxes and the accounting for goodwill and other longlived assets below we discuss these policies further as well as the estimates and judgments involved we also have other accounting policies and accounting estimates relating to uncollectible customer accounts valuation of inventory valuation of sharebased payments and restructuring we believe that these other accounting policies and accounting estimates either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective or it is less likely that they would have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period 

establishment of sales program accruals we establish certain distributor and oem sales programs aimed at increasing customer demand for the distribution channel these programs typically involve rebates related to a distributors level of sales order size advertising or point of sale activity and price protection adjustments for oem sales rebates are typically based on an oem customers volume of purchases or other agreed upon rebate programs we provide for these obligations at the time that revenue is recorded based on estimated requirements we estimate these contrarevenue rebates and adjustments based on various factors including price reductions during the period reported estimated future price erosion customer orders distributor sellthrough and inventory levels program participation customer claim submittals and sales returns our estimates reflect contractual arrangements but also our judgment relating to variables such as customer claim rates and attainment of program goals and inventory and sellthrough levels reported by our distribution customers currently our distributors inventories are at the low end of the historical range 

while we believe we have sufficient experience and knowledge of the market and customer buying patterns to reasonably estimate such rebates and adjustments actual market conditions or customer behavior could differ from our expectations as a result actual payments under these programs which may spread over several months after the related sale may vary from the amount accrued accordingly revenues and margins in the period in which the adjustment occurs may be affected 

significant actual variations in any of the factors upon which we base our contrarevenue estimates could have a material effect on our operating results in fiscal year 2011 sales programs were approximately 8 of gross revenue reflecting the cumulative effect of the competitive pricing environment during the first half of fiscal year 2011 for fiscal years 2009 and 2010 total sales programs have ranged from 6 to 12 of gross revenues adjustments to revenues due to under or over accruals for sales programs related to revenues reported in prior quarterly periods have averaged 05 of quarterly gross revenue for fiscal years 2009 through 2011 and were approximately 04 of quarterly gross revenue in fiscal year 2011 any future shifts in the industry supplydemand balance as well as other factors may result in a more competitive pricing environment and may cause sales programs as a percentage of gross revenue to increase from the current or historical levels if such rebates and incentives trend upwards revenues and margins will be reduced 

establishment of warranty accruals we estimate probable product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized we generally warrant our products for a period of one to five years our warranty provision considers estimated product failure rates and trends including the timing of product returns during the warranty periods estimated repair or replacement costs and estimated costs for customer compensatory claims related to product quality issues if any we use a statistical model to help with our estimates and we exercise considerable judgment in determining the underlying estimates should actual experience in any future period differ significantly from our estimates or should the rate of future product technological advancements fail to keep pace with the past our future results of operations could be materially affected our judgment is subject to a greater degree of subjectivity with respect to newly introduced products because of limited experience with those products upon which to base our warranty estimates 

the actual results with regard to warranty expenditures could have an adverse or favorable effect on our results of operations if the actual rate of unit failure the cost to repair a unit or the actual cost required to satisfy customer compensatory claims differs from those estimates we used in determining the warranty accrual since we typically outsource our warranty repairs our repair cost is subject to periodic negotiations with vendors and may vary from our estimates we also exercise judgment in estimating our ability to sell certain repaired disk drives to the extent such sales fall below our forecast warranty cost will be adversely impacted 

we review our warranty accrual quarterly for products shipped in prior periods and which are still under warranty any changes in the estimates underlying the accrual may result in adjustments that impact the current period gross margins and income in fiscal year 2011 net favorable changes in estimates of prior warranty accruals as a percentage of revenue were not material our total warranty cost was 18 13 and 24 of revenue during fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively while warranty cost related to new shipments exclusive of the impact of reestimates of preexisting liabilities were 18 18 and 27 respectively for the same periods changes in anticipated failure rates of specific products and significant changes in repair or replacement costs have historically been the major reasons for significant changes in prior estimates any future changes in failure rates of certain products as well as changes in repair costs or the cost of replacement parts may result in increased or decreased warranty accruals 

accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes pursuant to accounting standards codification asc topic 740 asc 740 income taxes in applying asc 740 we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits recognition of income and deductions and calculation of specific tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions the calculation of tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the internal revenue service or other tax jurisdictions if estimates of these tax liabilities are greater or less than actual results an additional tax benefit or provision will result the deferred tax assets we record each period depend primarily on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states and certain nonus jurisdictions each period we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and if necessary we adjust the valuation allowance so that net deferred tax assets are recorded only to the extent we conclude it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized if our outlook for future taxable income changes significantly our assessment of the need for a valuation allowance may also change 

accounting for goodwill and other longlived assets we account for goodwill in accordance with asc 350 intangibles—goodwill and other  as required by asc 350 we test goodwill of our reporting units annually during our fourth quarter or whenever events occur or circumstances change such as an adverse change in business climate or a decline in the overall industry that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 

in accordance with asc 360054 impairment or disposal of longlived assets  we test other longlived assets including property equipment and leasehold improvements and other intangible assets subject to amortization for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of those assets may not be recoverable we assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using the same approaches indicated above for asc 360 step two and compare it to its carrying value the excess of the carrying value over the fair value is allocated pro rata to derive the adjusted carrying value of each asset in the asset group the adjusted carrying value of each asset in the asset group is not reduced below its fair value 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 1 basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies for information regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our financial statements 

item 7a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 

we have exposure to market risks due to the volatility of interest rates foreign currency exchange rates equity and bond markets a portion of these risks are hedged but fluctuations could impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows additionally we have exposure to downgrades in the credit ratings of our counterparties as well as exposure related to our credit rating changes 

interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio at july 1 2011 with the exception of our auction rate securities we had no marketable securities that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for a period greater than 12 months and determined that no investments were otherthantemporarily impaired we currently do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 

we have fixed rate debt obligations we enter into debt obligations for general corporate purposes including capital expenditures and working capital needs we currently do not use interest rate derivatives to hedge interest rate exposure on our outstanding debt 

the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio and debt obligations as of july 1 2011 all shortterm investments mature in four years or less 

fiscal years ended 



foreign currency exchange risk we may enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposure related to certain foreign currency commitments and anticipated foreign currency denominated expenditures our policy prohibits us from entering into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes during fiscal years 2011 and 2010 we did not enter into any hedges of net investments in foreign operations 

we also hedge a portion of our foreign currency denominated balance sheet positions with foreign currency forward exchange contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings will be adversely affected by 

changes in currency exchange rates the changes in fair value of these hedges are recognized in earnings in the same period as the gains and losses from the remeasurement of the assets and liabilities these foreign currency forward exchange contracts are not designated as hedging instruments under asc 815 derivatives and hedging all these forward contracts mature within 12 months 

we evaluate hedging effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively and record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in costs of revenue on the consolidated statements of operations we did not have any material net gains losses recognized in costs of revenue for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness or discontinued cash flow hedges during fiscal years 2011 and 2010 

the table below provides information as of july 1 2011 about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts the table is provided in us dollar equivalent amounts and presents the notional amounts at the contract exchange rates and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates 



1 equivalent to the unrealized net gain loss on existing contracts 

other market risks we have exposure to counterparty credit downgrades in the form of credit risk related to our foreign currency forward exchange contracts and our fixed income portfolio we monitor and limit our credit exposure for our foreign currency forward exchange contracts by performing ongoing credit evaluations we also manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with any one counterparty and we maintain limits on maximum tenor of contracts based on the credit rating of the financial institutions additionally the investment portfolio is diversified and structured to minimize credit risk as of july 1 2011 we had counterparty credit exposure of 5 million comprised of the marktomarket valuation related to our foreign currency forward exchange contracts in a gain position changes in our corporate issuer credit ratings have minimal impact on our financial results but downgrades may negatively impact our future transaction costs and our ability to execute transactions with various counterparties 

we are subject to equity market risks due to changes in the fair value of the notional investments selected by our employees as part of our seagate deferred compensation plan the sdcp prior to january 3 2011 we had a total return swap trs in order to manage the equity market risks associated with the sdcp liabilities effective january 3 2011 we cancelled the trs and we currently manage our exposure to equity market risks associated with the sdcp liabilities by investing directly in mutual funds that mirror the employees investment options 

during fiscal year 2011 approximately 1 million of our auction rate securities were called by the issuers as of july 1 2011 we continued to hold auction rate securities with a par value of approximately 18 million all of which are collateralized by student loans guaranteed by the federal family education loan program beginning in the march 2008 quarter these securities have continuously failed to settle at auction as of july 1 2011 the estimated fair value of these auction rate securities was 16 million we believe that the impairments totaling 2 million are temporary as we do not intend to sell these securities and have concluded it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the securities before the recovery of the amortized cost basis as such the impairment was recorded in other comprehensive income loss and these securities were classified as longterm investments

demand for electronic data storage 

the electronic data storage industry has traditionally been focused on client compute applications we believe that technological advances in storage technology and a proliferation of client noncompute applications such as digital video recorders gaming devices digital music players and digital cameras are driving the broad global proliferation and growth of digital content through the 

• creation and sharing of all types of digital content such as highresolution photos high definition video and movies and music by consumers and electronic data by enterprises • aggregation and distribution of digital content through services and other offerings by companies such as youtube by google inc hulu llc by the national broadcasting company and fox broadcasting company a news corporation company itunes by apple inc myspace by news corporation and facebook • network infrastructure  including broadband cable and satellite that has enabled the access hosting and distribution of such digital content • enjoyment and consumption of digital content through dvrs handheld devices and gaming consoles as well as in automobiles and • protection of digital content through storage on backup devices and storage services as a result of these factors the nature and amount of content being created requires increasingly higher storage capacity in order to store manage distribute utilize and back up such content this in turn has resulted in the rapid growth in demand for electronic data storage applications and solutions 

we believe that demand for electronic data storage in the enterprise and traditional compute markets continues to grow as the proliferation of digital content in the consumer space has resulted in additional demand for storage by enterprises including those that host aggregate distribute or share such content other factors driving demand for additional storage include 

• continued growth in cloud computing and backup services for enterprises seeking efficient and costeffective methods of processing and storing data increases demand for storage as data centers expand and proliferate • increasing legal and regulatory requirements which necessitate larger archives • changes in the nature and amount of data being stored such as the growing use of digital records in the healthcare industry and • growth in data captured in computer to computer communications or dark data which does not require human interaction demand trends for disk drives 

we believe that continued growth in digital content requires increasingly higher storage capacity in order to store aggregate host distribute manage back up and use such content which we believe will continue to result in increased demand for disk drive products however the disk drive industry is sensitive to global macroeconomic conditions as experienced in fiscal year 2009 

historically the electronic data storage industry has introduced alternative technologies that directly compete with hard disk drives ssds using nand flash memory are a potential alternative to disk drives in certain applications such as consumer handheld devices and portable external storage nand flash memory is a type of nonvolatile storage technology that does not require power to retain data however we believe that in the foreseeable future the traditional enterprise and client compute markets that require high capacity storage solutions as well as the data intensive client noncompute markets will continue to 

be best served by hard disk drives based on the industrys ability to deliver reliable power consumption efficient and cost effective mass storage devices 

disk drives for enterprise storage we define enterprise storage as disk drives designed for mission critical applications and nearline applications 

mission critical applications are defined as applications that are vital to the operation of enterprises requiring high performance and high reliability disk drives we expect the market for mission critical enterprise storage solutions to be driven by enterprises continuing to move network traffic to dedicated storage area networks in an effort to reduce network complexity and increase energy savings we believe that this transition will lead to an increased demand for more energy efficient smaller form factor disk drives these solutions are comprised principally of high performance enterprise class disk drives with sophisticated firmware and communications technologies 

nearline applications are defined as applications that are less timecritical but capacityintensive such as reference data environments or redundancy for recovery purposes which require high capacity and low power consumption disk drives featuring lower costs per gigabyte we expect such applications which include storage for cloud computing and backup services will continue to grow and drive demand for disk drives designed with these attributes as data centers expand and proliferate 

ssd storage applications have been introduced as a potential alternative to redundant system startup or boot disk drives in addition enterprises are beginning to use ssds in applications where rapid processing andor lower power consumption is required the timing of significant adoption of ssds is dependent on enterprises weighing the pricing and other benefits of mission critical enterprise disk drives against the perceived performance benefits of ssds 

disk drives for client compute we define client compute applications as disk drives designed for the traditional desktop and mobile compute applications in the nearterm we believe that demand growth in client compute applications will be driven by what we believe to be an accelerating corporate technology refresh cycle in the longterm we believe that the proliferation of digital content will drive the demand for the client compute market 

as the proliferation of client compute applications that require minimal storage such as tablets and netbooks continues nand flash technology could become more competitive within the client compute market in the future 

disk drives for client noncompute we define client noncompute applications as disk drives designed for consumer electronic devices and disk drives used for external storage and networkattached storage nas disk drives designed for consumer electronic devices are primarily used in applications such as dvrs that require a higher capacity lower costpergigabyte storage solution disk drives for external and nas devices are designed for purposes such as personal data backup and portable external storage and to augment the consumers current desktop notebook or dvr disk drive capacities client noncompute applications also include devices designed to display digital media in the home theater we believe the proliferation of high definition and mediarich digital content will continue to create increasing consumer demand for higher storage solutions 

disk drive technology 

overview 

the design and manufacturing of disk drives depends on highly advanced technology and manufacturing techniques and therefore requires high levels of research and development spending and capital equipment investments manufacturing our disk drives is a complex process that begins with the production of individual components and ends with a fully assembled unit we design fabricate and assemble a number of the most important components found in our disk drives including readwrite heads 

and recording media our design and manufacturing operations are based on technology platforms that are used to produce various disk drive products that serve multiple data storage applications and markets our core technology platforms are focused around the areal density of media and readwrite head technologies using an integrated platform design and manufacturing leverage approach allows us to deliver a portfolio of disk drive products to service a wide range of electronic data storage applications and a wide range of industries 

disk drive performance 

disk drive performance is commonly differentiated by six key characteristics 

• storage capacity commonly expressed in gigabytes gb or terabytes tb which is the amount of data that can be stored on the disk • spindle rotation speed commonly expressed in revolutions per minute rpm which has an effect on speed of access to data • interface transfer rate commonly expressed in megabytes per second which is the rate at which data moves between the disk drive and the computer controller • average seek time commonly expressed in milliseconds which is the time needed to position the heads over a selected track on the disk surface • data transfer rate commonly expressed in megabytes per second which is the rate at which data is transferred to and from the disk and • product quality and reliability commonly expressed in annualized return rates areal density 

areal density is a measure of storage capacity per square inch on the recording surface of a disk the capacity of a disk drive is determined by the number of disks it contains as well as the areal density capability of these disks we expect the longterm demand for increased disk drive capacities will continue to grow proportionately with the shift in storage applications from predominantly compute applications to more mediarich content in particular audio video and photo storage data continue to increase in size with high definition video content being an example of data requiring many multiples of the storage capacity of standard video we believe that demand will further intensify by the proliferation of these forms of content we have been pursuing and will continue to pursue a number of technologies to increase areal densities across the entire range of our products for expanding disk drive capacities and reducing the number of disks and heads per drive to further reduce product costs 

manufacturing 

disk drive manufacturers are distinguished by their level of vertical integration which is the degree to which they control the design and manufacture of the technology used in their products and by whether they are captive producing disk drives for their own computer systems or independent producing disk drives as a standalone product 

vertically integrated hard drive manufacturers design and produce their own readwrite heads and recording media which are critical technologies for disk drives this integrated approach enables manufacturers to lower costs and to improve the functionality of components so that they work together efficiently in contrast manufacturers that are not integrated purchase most of their components from thirdparty suppliers upon whom they depend for key elements of their technological innovation and differentiation this can limit their ability to coordinate technology roadmaps and optimize the component design process for manufacturing efficiency and product reliability while making them reliant on the technology investment decisions of their suppliers independent manufacturers can enjoy a competitive 

advantage over captive manufacturers in working with oems because they do not compete with oems for computer system sales we believe the competitive dynamics of the disk drive industry favor vertically integrated independent manufacturers with the scale to make substantial technology investments and apply them across a broad product portfolio and set of customers 

we pursue a vertically integrated business strategy based on the ownership of critical component technologies allowing us to maintain control over our product roadmap and component cost quality and availability we believe that because of our vertical design and manufacturing strategy we are well suited to meet the challenges posed by the close interdependence of components for disk drives our manufacturing efficiency and flexibility are critical elements of our integrated business strategy we continuously seek to improve our manufacturing efficiency and cost by 

• employing manufacturing automation to enhance our efficiency • improving product quality and reliability and reducing costs • integrating our supply chain with suppliers and customers to enhance our demand visibility and reduce our working capital requirements • coordinating between our manufacturing group and our research and development organization to rapidly achieve volume manufacturing and • rationalizing the facilities we operate and reducing the number of personnel we employ a vertically integrated model however tends to have less flexibility when demand moderates because it exposes us to higher unit costs as capacity utilization is not optimized 

due to the significant challenges posed by the need to continually innovate and improve manufacturing efficiency and the continued demands on capital and research and development investments required to do so the disk drive industry has undergone significant consolidation as disk drive manufacturers and component manufacturers merged with other companies or exited the industry the trend toward consolidation is more pronounced during times of macroeconomic contraction for example toshiba corporation acquired fujitsu limiteds hard disk drive business in october 2009 the increasing technological challenges associated levels of investment and competitive necessity of largescale operations may also drive future industry consolidation additionally we may in the future face indirect competition from customers who from time to time evaluate whether to offer electronic data storage products that may compete with our products 

components and raw materials 

all of our disk drive products incorporate certain components including a head disk assembly and a printed circuit board mounted to the head disk assembly which are sealed inside a rigid base and top cover containing the recording components in a contamination controlled environment we maintain a highly integrated approach to our business by designing and manufacturing a significant portion of the components we view as critical to our products such as recording heads and media 

readwrite heads the function of the readwrite head is to scan across the disk as it spins magnetically recording or reading information the tolerances of recording heads are extremely demanding and require stateoftheart equipment and processes our readwrite heads are manufactured with thinfilm and photolithographic processes similar to those used to produce semiconductor integrated circuits though challenges in magnetic film properties and topographical structures are unique to the disk drive industry we perform all primary stages of design and manufacture of readwrite heads at our facilities we use a combination of internally manufactured and externally sourced readwrite heads the mix of which varies based on product mix technology and our internal capacity levels 

media information is written to the media or disk as it rotates at very high speeds past the readwrite head the media is made from nonmagnetic material usually aluminum alloy or glass and is coated with a thin layer of magnetic material we use a combination of internally manufactured and externally sourced finished media and aluminum substrates the mix of which varies based on product mix technology and our internal capacity levels we purchase all of our glass substrates from third parties which we use in the disk drives we make for mobile products 

printed circuit board assemblies the printed circuit board assemblies pcbas are comprised of standard and custom asics and ancillary electronic control chips the asics control the movement of data to and from the readwrite heads and through the internal controller and interface which communicates with the host computer the asics and control chips form electronic circuitry that delivers instructions to a head positioning mechanism called an actuator to guide the heads to the selected track of a disk where the data is recorded or retrieved disk drive manufacturers use one or more industry standard interfaces such as serial advanced technology architecture sata small computer system interface scsi serial attached scsi sas or fibre channel fc to communicate to the host systems we outsource to third parties the manufacture and assembly of the pcbas used in our disk drives we do not manufacture any asics but we participate in their proprietary design 

head disk assembly the head disk assembly consists of one or more disks attached to a spindle assembly powered by a spindle motor that rotates the disks at a high constant speed around a hub the disks or recording media are the components on which data is stored and from which it is retrieved each disk consists of a substrate of finely machined aluminum or glass deposited with layers of thinfilm magnetic material readwrite heads mounted on an arm assembly similar in concept to that of a record player fly extremely close to each disk surface and record data on and retrieve it from concentric tracks in the magnetic layers of the rotating disks the readwrite heads are mounted vertically on an eshaped assembly that is actuated by a voicecoil motor to allow the heads to move from track to track the eblock and the recording media are mounted inside the head disk assembly we purchase spindle motors from outside vendors and from time to time participate in the design of the motors that go into our products 

disk drive assembly following the completion of the head disk assembly it is mated to the pcba and the completed unit goes through extensive defect mapping and testing prior to packaging and shipment disk drive assembly and test operations occur primarily at facilities located in china singapore and thailand we perform subassembly and component manufacturing operations at our facilities in china malaysia northern ireland singapore thailand and in the united states in minnesota in addition third parties manufacture and assemble components for us in various asian countries including china japan south korea malaysia the philippines singapore taiwan thailand and vietnam in europe and in the united states 

suppliers of components and industry constraints due to industry consolidation there are a limited number of independent suppliers of components such as recording heads and media available to disk drive manufacturers vertically integrated disk drive manufacturers who manufacture their own components are less dependent on external component suppliers than less vertically integrated disk drive manufacturers 

we believe the supply chain was generally tight for the industry during most of fiscal year 2010 availability of glass substrates finished media and heads improved during the june 2010 quarter however supply of these critical components is still expected to be generally tight for the second half of the 2010 calendar year reflecting typical seasonal patterns 

commodity and other manufacturing costs the production of disk drives requires precious metals scarce alloys and industrial commodities which are subject to fluctuations in prices and the supply of which has at times been constrained we believe that currently there is an adequate supply of these precious metals scarce alloys and industrial commodities additionally volatility in fuel costs may increase our costs 

related to commodities manufacturing and freight as a result we may increase our use of ocean shipments to help offset any increase in freight costs 

industry supply balance 

from time to time the industry has experienced periods of imbalance between supply and demand to the extent that the disk drive industry builds capacity based on expectations of demand that do not materialize price erosion may become more pronounced conversely during periods where demand exceeds supply price erosion is generally muted for the first half of fiscal year 2010 our industry experienced unmet demand due to industrywide supply constraints while in the march 2010 quarter supply and demand were relatively balanced however in the june 2010 quarter industry supply exceeded demand which we believe reflected a return to seasonal patterns typical of a june quarter

customers 

we sell our disk drives primarily to major oems we also sell to distributors and retailers under our globally recognized brand names we have longstanding relationships with many of our oem customers such as hewlettpackard company dell inc and emc corporation 

the following table summarizes our disk drive revenue by channel and by geography 



oem customers typically enter into master purchase agreements with us these agreements provide for pricing volume discounts order lead times product support obligations and other terms and conditions the term of these agreements is usually 6 to 24 months however they are generally cancelable for convenience by either party upon written notice our product support obligations generally extend substantially beyond the term of the agreement these master agreements typically do not commit the customer to buy any minimum quantity of products or create exclusive relationships deliveries are scheduled only after receipt of purchase orders in addition with limited leadtime customers may cancel or defer most purchase orders without significant penalty anticipated orders from many of our customers have in the past failed to materialize or oem delivery schedules have been deferred or altered as a result of changes in their business needs 

our distributors generally enter into nonexclusive agreements for the resale of our products they typically furnish us with a nonbinding indication of their nearterm requirements and product deliveries are generally scheduled accordingly the agreements and related sales programs typically provide the distributors with limited right of return and price protection rights in addition we offer sales programs to distributors on a quarterly and periodic basis to promote the sale of selected products in the sales channel 

our retail channel consists of our branded storage products sold to retailers either by us directly or by our distributors retail sales made by us or our distributors typically require greater marketing support sales incentives and price protection periods 

the only customers exceeding 10 of our consolidated revenue for fiscal years 2008 through 2010 were hewlettpackard company and dell inc accounting for approximately 16 and 11 respectively of our consolidated revenue in each year we have master purchase agreements in place with hewlettpackard company and dell inc that are cancelable for convenience by either party upon written notice and do not require either customer to purchase any minimum or other specified quantity of our products see item 1a risk factors—risks related to our business—dependence on key customers—we may be adversely affected by the loss of or reduced delayed or cancelled purchases by one or more of our larger customers 

competition 

the markets that we compete in are intensely competitive disk drive manufacturers not only compete for a limited number of major disk drive customers but also compete with other companies in the electronic data storage industry that provide alternative storage solutions such as flash memory tape optical and ssds some of the principal factors used by customers to differentiate among electronic data storage solutions manufacturers are storage capacity price per unit and price per gigabyte storageretrieval access times data transfer rates product quality and reliability supply continuity form factor warranty and brand we believe that our disk drive products are competitive with respect to each of these factors in the markets that we currently address 

we summarize below our principal disk drive competitors other competitors the effect of competition on price erosion for our products and product life cycles and technology 

principal disk drive competitors we have experienced and expect to continue to experience intense competition from a number of domestic and foreign companies some of which have greater financial and other resources than we have these competitors include independent disk drive manufacturers such as western digital corporation as well as large captive manufacturers such as hitachi global storage technologies samsung electronics co ltd and toshiba corporation because these captive manufacturers produce complete computer systems and other noncompute consumer electronics and mobile devices they can derive a greater portion of their operating margins from other components which may reduce their need to realize a profit on the disk drives included in their computer systems and may allow them to sell disk drives to third parties at very low margins many captive manufacturers are also formidable competitors because they have more resources and greater access to their internal customers than we do in addition competitors such as samsung electronics co ltd and toshiba corporation are increasingly integrating other storage technologies such as flash memory hybrid disk drives and ssds into their product offerings not only may they be willing to sell their disk drives at a lower margin to advance their overall business strategy their portfolio may allow them to be indifferent to which technology prevails over the other as they can offer a broad range of storage media and solutions and focus on those with lowest costs and greatest sales in addition to competing with our disk drive competitors we also compete with companies such as iomega corporation an emc company and lacie sa that purchase disk drives from us and our competitors for use in their branded storage products 

other competitors we also are experiencing competition from companies that provide alternative storage technologies such as flash memory and ssds in the flash memory market primarily used in lower 

capacity handheld devices our principal competitors include micron technology inc samsung electronics co ltd sandisk corporation and toshiba corporation in enterprise applications where ssds are used for rapid processing and high volume transactions our principal ssd competitors include hitachi global storage technologies intel corporation and stec inc with others expected to enter in the near future 

price erosion our industry has been characterized by price declines for disk drive products with comparable capacity performance and feature sets likeforlike products price declines for likeforlike products price erosion are more pronounced during periods of 

• economic contraction or industry consolidation in which competitors may use discounted pricing to attempt to maintain or gain market share • few new product introductions when multiple competitors have comparable or alternative product offerings • temporary imbalances between industry supply and demand and • seasonally weaker demand which may cause excess supply disk drive manufacturers typically attempt to offset price erosion with an improved mix of disk drive products characterized by higher capacity better performance and additional feature sets andor product cost reductions 

we expect price erosion in our industry to continue to remain competitive we believe it is necessary for industry participants to continue to introduce new product offerings that utilize advanced technologies ahead of the competition in order to take advantage of potentially higher initial profit margins and reduced cost structures on these new products 

product life cycles and changing technology our industry has been characterized by significant advances in technology which have contributed to rapid product life cycles as a result success in our industry has been dependent to a large extent on the ability to be the firsttomarket with new products allowing those disk drive manufacturers who introduce new products first to sell those products at a premium until comparable products are introduced also because our industry is characterized by continuous price erosion the existence of rapid product life cycles has necessitated quick achievement of product cost effectiveness changing technology also necessitates ongoing investments in research and development which may be difficult to recover due to rapid product life cycles and economic declines further there is a continued need to successfully execute product transitions and new product introductions as factors such as quality reliability and manufacturing yields become of increasing competitive importance 

seasonality 

the disk drive industry traditionally experiences seasonal variability in demand with higher levels of demand in the second half of the calendar year this seasonality is driven by consumer spending in the backtoschool season from late summer to fall and the traditional holiday shopping season from fall to winter in addition corporate demand is typically higher during the second half of the calendar year for most of fiscal year 2010 our industry observed a muted seasonal pattern as the hard disk drive industry experienced unmet demand due to industrywide supply constraints while in the march 2010 quarter supply and demand were relatively balanced however in the june 2010 quarter industry supply exceeded demand which we believe reflected a return to seasonal patterns typical of a june quarter 

research and development 

we are committed to developing new component technologies products and alternative storage technologies including solid state technology our research and development focus is designed to bring 

new products to market in high volume with quality attributes that our customers expect before our competitors part of our product development strategy is to leverage a design platform andor subsystem within product families to serve different market needs this platform strategy allows for more efficient resource utilization leverages best design practices reduces exposure to changes in demand and allows for achievement of lower costs through purchasing economies our advanced technology integration effort focuses disk drive and component research on recording subsystems including readwrite heads and recording media marketspecific product technology and technology focused towards new business opportunities the primary purpose of our advanced technology integration effort is to ensure timely availability of mature component technologies to our product development teams as well as allowing us to leverage and coordinate those technologies in the design centers across our products in order to take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace during fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 we had product development expenses of approximately 877 million 953 million and 1028 million respectively which represented 8 10 and 8 of our consolidated revenue respectively 

patents and licenses 

as of july 2 2010 we had 4149 us patents and 625 patents issued in various foreign jurisdictions as well as 1232 us and 478 foreign patent applications pending the number of patents and patent applications will vary at any given time as part of our ongoing patent portfolio management activity due to the rapid technological change that characterizes the electronic data storage industry we believe that in addition to patent protection the improvement of existing products reliance upon trade secrets protection of unpatented proprietary knowhow and development of new products are also important to our business in establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage accordingly we intend to continue our efforts to broadly protect our intellectual property including obtaining patents where available in connection with our research and development program 

the electronic data storage industry is characterized by significant litigation relating to patent and other intellectual property rights because of rapid technological development in the electronic data storage industry some of our products have been and in the future could be alleged to infringe existing patents of third parties from time to time we receive claims that our products infringe patents of third parties although we have been able to resolve some of those claims or potential claims by obtaining licenses or rights under the patents in question without a material adverse affect on us other claims have resulted in adverse decisions or settlements in addition other claims are pending which if resolved unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations for more information on these claims see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data—note 13 legal environmental and other contingencies the costs of engaging in intellectual property litigation in the past have been and in the future may be substantial irrespective of the merits of the claim or the outcome we have patent licenses with a number of companies additionally as part of our normal intellectual property practices we may be engaged in negotiations with other major electronic data storage companies and component manufacturers with respect to patent licenses 

backlog 

in view of our customers rights to cancel or defer orders with little or no penalty we believe backlog in the disk drive industry is of limited indicative value in estimating future performance and results 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to us and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites some of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution and these permits are subject to modification renewal and revocation by issuing authorities 

we have established environmental management systems and continually update our environmental policies and standard operating procedures for our operations worldwide we believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws regulations and permits we budget for operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental laws if additional or more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future we could incur additional operating costs and capital expenditures 

some environmental laws such as the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended the superfund law and its state equivalents can impose liability for the cost of cleanup of contaminated sites upon any of the current or former site owners or operators or upon parties who sent waste to these sites regardless of whether the owner or operator owned the site at the time of the release of hazardous substances or the lawfulness of the original disposal activity we have been identified as a potentially responsible party at several sites at each of these sites we have an assigned portion of the financial liability based on the type and amount of hazardous substances disposed of by each party at the site and the number of financially viable parties we have fulfilled our responsibilities at some of these sites and remain involved in only a few at this time 

while our ultimate costs in connection with these sites is difficult to predict with complete accuracy based on our current estimates of cleanup costs and our expected allocation of these costs we do not expect costs in connection with these sites to be material 

we may be subject to various state federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment including those restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products for example the european union eu enacted the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment which prohibits the use of certain substances including lead in certain products including disk drives put on the market after july 1 2006 similar legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions including in the united states canada mexico china and japan 

if we or our suppliers fail to comply with the substance restrictions recycle requirements or other environmental requirements as they are enacted worldwide it could have a materially adverse effect on our business 

employees 

at july 2 2010 we employed approximately 52600 employees temporary employees and contractors worldwide of which approximately 45000 employees were located in our asian operations we believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees at all levels we believe that our employee relations are good

 item 1a risk factors 

risks related to our business 

current macroeconomic conditions—the recent downturn in the macroeconomic environment has and may continue to negatively impact our results of operations 

the recent downturn in global macroeconomic conditions particularly in europe has had a significant effect on the disk drive industry as a whole and the results of our operations due to the ongoing uncertainty about current macroeconomic conditions we believe our customers may postpone spending in response to tighter credit increasing level of unemployment negative financial news andor declines in income or asset values which could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products other factors that could influence demand include conditions in the residential real estate and mortgage markets labor and healthcare costs access to credit consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior these and other economic factors could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and on our financial condition and operating results 

in addition the capital and credit markets continue to experience some measure of volatility and disruption resulting in a tightening in the credit markets a low level of liquidity in many financial markets and reduced stability in fixed income credit currency and equity markets there could be a number of followon effects from the credit crisis on our business including the insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays and the inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products 

competition—our industry is highly competitive and our products have experienced and will continue to experience significant price erosion and market share variability 

the disk drive industry is intensely competitive and vendors typically experience substantial price erosion over the life of a product our competitors have historically offered existing products at lower prices as part of a strategy to gain or retain market share and customers and we expect these practices to continue we will need to continually reduce our prices for existing products to retain our market share which could adversely affect our results of operations 

the pricing environment in the first nine months of our 2010 fiscal year was relatively stable owing in part to a favorable supplydemand balance though in the june 2010 quarter price erosion returned to seasonal patterns typical of a june quarter we believe price erosion and market share variability will continue as the industry engages in aggressive pricing actions targeted to shift customer demand to offset lower demand due to the deterioration in business and economic conditions 

our ability to offset the effect of price erosion through new product introductions at higher average prices is diminished to the extent competitors introduce products into particular markets ahead of our similar competing products this risk is particularly pronounced in markets where we have recently experienced lower market share as is the case in the market for 25inch ata products our ability to offset the effect of price erosion is also diminished during times when product life cycles for particular products are extended allowing competitors more time to enter the market 

the growth of sales to distributors that serve producers of nonbranded products in the personal storage sector may also contribute to increased price erosion these customers generally have limited product qualification programs which increases the number of competing products available to satisfy their demand as a result purchasing decisions for these customers are based largely on price and terms any increase in our average price erosion would have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

additionally a significant portion of our success in the past has been a result of increasing our market share at the expense of our competitors particularly in enterprise markets market share for our products can be negatively affected by our customers diversifying their sources of supply as our competitors enter 

the market for particular products as well as by our ability to ramp volume production of new product offerings when our competitors successfully introduce product offerings that are competitive with our recently introduced products our customers may quickly diversify their sources of supply any significant decline in our market share in any of our principal market applications would adversely affect our results of operations 

principal competitors—we compete with both independent manufacturers whose primary focus is producing technologically advanced disk drives and captive manufacturers who do not depend solely on sales of disk drives to maintain their profitability 

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience intense competition from a number of domestic and foreign companies including other independent disk drive manufacturers and large captive manufacturers the term independent in this context refers to manufacturers that primarily produce disk drives as a standalone product such as western digital corporation and the term captive in this context refers to manufacturers who themselves or through affiliated entities produce complete computer or other systems that contain disk drives or other electronic data storage products such as hitachi global storage technologies samsung electronics incorporated and toshiba corporation 

captive manufacturers are formidable competitors because they have the ability to determine pricing for complete systems without regard to the margins on individual components as components other than disk drives generally contribute a greater portion of the operating margin on a complete computer system than do disk drives captive manufacturers do not necessarily need to realize a profit on the disk drives included in a complete computer system and as a result may be willing to sell disk drives to third parties at very low margins captive manufacturers are also formidable competitors because they have more substantial resources than we do samsung and hitachi together with affiliated entities also sell other products to our customers including critical components like flash memory asics and flat panel displays and may be willing to sell their disk drives at a lower margin to advance their overall business strategy to the extent we are not successful competing with captive or independent disk drive manufacturers our results of operations will be adversely affected 

in response to customer demand for highquality highvolume and lowcost disk drives manufacturers of disk drives have had to develop large and in some cases global production facilities with highly developed technological capabilities and internal controls the development of these large production facilities combined with industry consolidation can further increase the intensity of competition 

we also face indirect competition from present and potential customers who evaluate from time to time whether to manufacture their own disk drives or other electronic data storage products 

we also experience competition from other companies that produce alternative storage technologies like flash memory where increasing capacity decreasing cost lower power consumption and improvements in performance ruggedness have resulted in competition with our lower capacity smaller form factor disk drives while this competition has traditionally been in the markets for handheld consumer electronics applications these competitors have announced solid state drives ssds for netbook notebook and enterprise compute applications some of these companies like samsung also sell disk drives certain customers for both notebook and enterprise compute applications are evaluating and may adopt ssds as alternatives to hard drives in certain applications 

volatility of quarterly results—our quarterly results of operations fluctuate sometimes significantly from period to period and may cause our share price to decline 

in the past our quarterly revenue and results of operations have fluctuated sometimes significantly from period to period these fluctuations which we expect to continue may be occasioned by a variety of factors including 

• current uncertainty in global economic conditions may pose a risk to the overall economy • adverse changes in the level of economic activity in the major regions in which we do business for example europe in the june 2010 quarter • competitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices by our competitors targeted to encourage shifting of customer demand • delays or problems in our introduction of new products particularly new disk drives with lower cost structures the inability to achieve high production yields or delays in customer qualification or initial product quality issues • changes in purchasing patterns by our distributor customers • increased costs or adverse changes in availability of supplies of raw materials or components especially in light of recent consolidation among component suppliers building inflationary pressure and the relative volatility of the us dollar as compared to other currencies • the impact of corporate restructuring activities that we have and may continue to engage in • changes in the demand for the computer systems storage subsystems and consumer electronics that contain our disk drives due to seasonality economic conditions and other factors • changes in purchases from period to period by our primary customers particularly as our competitors are able to introduce and produce in volume competing disk drive solutions or alternative storage technology solutions such as flash memory or ssds • shifting trends in customer demand which when combined with overproduction of particular products particularly when the industry is served by multiple suppliers results in unfavorable supplydemand imbalances • our high proportion of fixed costs including research and development expenses and • announcements of new products services or technological innovations by us or our competitors as a result we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our revenue and results of operations may not be meaningful and that these comparisons may not be an accurate indicator of our future performance our results of operations in one or more future quarters may fail to meet the expectations of investment research analysts or investors which could cause an immediate and significant decline in the trading price of our ordinary shares 

new product offerings—market acceptance of new product introductions cannot be accurately predicted and our results of operations will suffer if there is less demand for our new products than is anticipated 

we are continually developing new products with the goal that we will be able to introduce technologically advanced and lower cost disk drives into the marketplace ahead of our competitors 

the success of our new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors including market acceptance our ability to manage the risks associated with product transitions the effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand and the risk that our new products will have quality problems or other defects in the early stages of introduction that were not anticipated in the design 

of those products accordingly we cannot accurately determine the ultimate effect that our new products will have on our results of operations 

in addition the success of our new product introductions is dependent upon our ability to qualify as a primary source of supply with our oem customers in order for our products to be considered by our customers for qualification we must be among the leaders in timetomarket with those new products once a product is accepted for qualification testing any failure or delay in the qualification process or a requirement that we requalify can result in our losing sales to that customer until new products are introduced the limited number of highvolume oems magnifies the effect of missing a product qualification opportunity these risks are further magnified because we expect competitive pressures to result in declining sales eroding prices and declining gross margins on our current generation products we cannot assure that we will be among the leaders in timetomarket with new products or that we will be able to successfully qualify new products with our customers in the future if we cannot successfully deliver competitive products our future results of operations may be adversely affected 

smaller form factor disk drives—if we do not continue to successfully market smaller form factor disk drives our business may suffer 

the disk drive industry is experiencing significant increases in sales of smaller form factor disk drives for an expanding number of applications in particular notebook computers and consumer electronic devices but also in personal computers and enterprise storage applications our future success will depend on our ability to develop and introduce smaller form factor drives at desired price and capacity points faster than our competitors 

we have experienced competition from other companies that produce alternative storage technologies like solid state or flash memory where increased capacity improving cost lower power consumption and performance ruggedness have resulted in flash memory largely replacing disk drives in handheld applications we believe that the demand for disk drives to store or back up related media content from such handheld devices however continues to grow while this competition has traditionally been limited to the markets for handheld consumer electronics applications these competitors have announced ssds for netbook notebook and enterprise compute applications 

if we do not suitably adapt our product offerings to successfully introduce additional smaller form factor disk drives or alternative storage products based on flash storage technology or if our competitors are successful in achieving customer acceptance of ssd products for netbook notebook and enterprise compute applications then our customers may decrease the amounts of our products that they purchase which would adversely affect our results of operations 

seasonality—because we experience seasonality in the sales of our products our results of operations will generally be adversely impacted during the second half of our fiscal year 

sales of computer systems storage subsystems and consumer electronics tend to be seasonal and therefore we expect to continue to experience seasonality in our business as we respond to variations in our customers demand for disk drives in particular we anticipate that sales of our products will continue to be lower during the second half of our fiscal year in the client compute and client noncompute market applications of our business this seasonality is partially attributable to the historical trend in our results derived from our customers increased sales of desktop computers notebook computers and consumer electronics during the backtoschool and winter holiday season in the enterprise market our sales are seasonal because of the capital budgeting and purchasing cycles of our end users since our working capital needs peak during periods in which we are increasing production in anticipation of orders that have not yet been received our results of operations will fluctuate seasonally even if the forecasted demand for our products proves accurate furthermore it is difficult for us to evaluate the degree to which this seasonality may affect our business in future periods because of the rate and unpredictability of product transitions 

and new product introductions particularly in the client noncompute market as well as macroeconomic conditions 

difficulty in predicting quarterly demand—if we fail to predict demand accurately for our products in any quarter we may not be able to recapture the cost of our investments 

the disk drive industry operates on quarterly purchasing cycles with much of the order flow in any given quarter typically coming at the end of that quarter our manufacturing process requires us to make significant productspecific investments in inventory in each quarter for that quarters production since we typically receive the bulk of our orders late in a quarter after we have made our investments there is a risk that our orders will not be sufficient to allow us to recapture the costs of our investment before the products resulting from that investment have become obsolete we cannot assure you that we will be able to accurately predict demand in the future 

the difficulty in forecasting demand also increases the difficulty in anticipating our inventory requirements which may cause us to overproduce finished goods resulting in inventory writeoffs or underproduce finished goods affecting our ability to meet customer requirements additionally the risk of inventory writeoffs could increase if we were to continue to hold higher inventory levels we cannot be certain that we will be able to recover the costs associated with increased inventory 

other factors that may negatively impact our ability to recapture the cost of investments in any given quarter include 

• the impact of variable demand and an aggressive pricing environment for disk drives • the impact of competitive product announcements and possible excess industry supply both with respect to particular disk drive products and with respect to competing alternative storage technology solutions such as ssds in netbook notebook and enterprise compute applications • our inability to reduce our fixed costs to match sales in any quarter because of our vertical manufacturing strategy which means that we make more capital investments than we would if we were not vertically integrated • dependence on our ability to successfully qualify manufacture and sell in increasing volumes on a costeffective basis and with acceptable quality our disk drive products particularly the new disk drive products with lower cost structures • variations in the cost of components for our products especially during periods when the us dollar is relatively volatile as compared to other currencies • uncertainty in the amount of purchases from our distributor customers who from time to time constitute a large portion of our total sales • our product mix and the related margins of the various products • accelerated reduction in the price of our disk drives due to technological advances andor an oversupply of disk drives in the market a condition that is exacerbated when the industry is served by multiple suppliers and shifting trends in demand which can create supply and demand imbalances • manufacturing delays or interruptions particularly at our manufacturing facilities in china malaysia northern ireland singapore thailand or the united states • limited access to components that we obtain from a single or a limited number of suppliers • the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the cost of producing our products and the effective price of our products to foreign consumers and • operational issues arising out of the increasingly automated nature of our manufacturing processes 23 

dependence on supply of components equipment and raw materials—if we experience shortages or delays in the receipt of or cost increases in critical components equipment or raw materials necessary to manufacture our products we may suffer lower operating margins production delays and other material adverse effects 

the cost quality and supply of components certain equipment and raw materials used to manufacture disk drives and key components like recording media and heads are critical to our success the equipment we use to manufacture our products and components is frequently custom made and comes from a few suppliers and the lead times required to obtain manufacturing equipment can be significant particularly important components for disk drives include readwrite heads aluminum or glass substrates for recording media asics spindle motors printed circuit boards and suspension assemblies we rely on sole suppliers or a limited number of suppliers for some of these components that we do not manufacture including aluminum and glass substrates readwrite heads asics spindle motors printed circuit boards and suspension assemblies if our vendors for these components are unable to meet our cost quality and supply requirements we could experience a shortage in supply or an increase in production costs which would adversely affect our results of operations 

in addition the recent increases in demand for small form factor mobile products have led to shortages in glass substrates a component used in smaller form factor disk drives to make the recording media for such drives if our vendors for glass substrates are unable to meet our demand or are unable to invest sufficient capital to expand capacity to meet the industrys increasing unit growth in small form factor mobile disk drives we could experience a shortage in the supply of this critical component which could limit our ability to meet our customers demand for smaller form factor disk drives 

in the past we have experienced increased costs and production delays when we were unable to obtain the necessary equipment or sufficient quantities of some components andor have been forced to pay higher prices or make volume purchase commitments or advance deposits for some components equipment or raw materials that were in short supply in the industry in general 

consolidation among component manufacturers may result in some component manufacturers exiting the industry or not making sufficient investments in research to develop new components 

if there is a shortage of or delay in supplying us with critical components equipment or raw materials then 

• it is likely that our suppliers would raise their prices and if we could not pass these price increases to our customers our operating margin would decline • we might have to reengineer some products which would likely cause production and shipment delays make the reengineered products more costly and provide us with a lower rate of return on these products • we would likely have to allocate the components we receive to certain of our products and ship less of others which could reduce our revenues and could cause us to lose sales to customers who could purchase more of their required products from manufacturers that either did not experience these shortages or delays or that made different allocations and • we might be late in shipping products causing potential customers to make purchases from our competitors thus causing our revenue and operating margin to decline we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain critical components in a timely and economic manner 

importance of timetomarket—our results of operations may depend on our being among the firsttomarket with new product offerings and achieving sufficient production volume with our new products 

to achieve consistent success with our oem customers it is important that we be an early provider of new types of disk drives featuring leading highquality technology and lower per gigabyte storage cost historically our results of operations have substantially depended upon our ability to be among the firsttomarket with new product offerings our market share and results of operations in the future may be adversely affected if we fail to 

• consistently maintain our timetomarket performance with our new products • produce these products in sufficient volume • qualify these products with key customers on a timely basis by meeting our customers performance and quality specifications or • achieve acceptable manufacturing yields quality and costs with these products if the delivery of our products is delayed our oem customers may use our competitors products to meet their production requirements if the delay of our products causes delivery of those oems computer systems into which our products are integrated to be delayed consumers and businesses may purchase comparable products from the oems competitors 

we face the related risk that consumers and businesses may wait to make their purchases if they want to buy a new product that has been shipped or announced but not yet released if this were to occur we may be unable to sell our existing inventory of products that may be less efficient and cost effective compared to new products as a result even if we are among the firsttomarket with a given product subsequent introductions or announcements by our competitors of new products could cause us to lose revenue and not achieve a positive return on our investment in existing products and inventory 

industry demand—poor global economic conditions and changes in demand for computer systems and storage subsystems may cause in the future a decline in demand for our products 

our disk drives are components in computers computer systems storage subsystems and consumer electronics devices the demand for these products has been volatile during times of poor global economic conditions consumer spending tends to decline and retail demand for personal computers and consumer electronics devices tends to decrease as does enterprise demand for computer systems and storage subsystems moreover unexpected slowdowns in demand for computer systems storage subsystems or consumer electronics devices generally cause sharp declines in demand for disk drive products the decline in consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services and on our financial condition and results of operations 

additional causes of declines in demand for our products in the past have included announcements or introductions of major new operating systems or semiconductor improvements or changes in consumer preferences such as the shift from desktop to notebook computers we believe these announcements and introductions have from time to time caused consumers to defer their purchases and made inventory obsolete whenever an oversupply of disk drives causes participants in our industry to have higher than anticipated inventory levels we experience even more intense price competition from other disk drive manufacturers than usual 

dependence on distributors—we are dependent on sales to distributors and retailers which may increase price erosion and the volatility of our sales 

a substantial portion of our sales has been to distributors of disk drive products certain of our distributors may also market other products that compete with our products product qualification programs in this distribution channel are limited which increases the number of competing products that 

are available to satisfy demand particularly in times of lengthening product cycles as a result purchasing decisions in this channel are based largely on price terms and product availability sales volumes through this channel are also less predictable and subject to greater volatility than sales to our oem customers in addition deterioration in business and economic conditions could exacerbate price erosion and volatility as distributors lower prices to compensate for lower demand and higher inventory levels our distributors ability to access credit for purposes of funding their operations may also affect purchases of our products by these customers 

if distributors reduce their purchases of our products or prices decline significantly in the distribution channel or if distributors experience financial difficulties or terminate their relationships with us our revenues and results of operations would be adversely affected 

dependence on sales of disk drives in client noncompute applications—our sales of disk drives for client noncompute applications which have contributed significant revenues to our results can experience significant volatility due to seasonal and other factors which could materially adversely impact our future results of operations 

sales of disk drives for client noncompute applications have contributed significant revenues to our results consumer spending on client noncompute has however and may continue to deteriorate significantly in many countries and regions including the united states due to poor global economic conditions and increasing levels of unemployment this could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services and on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition the demand for client noncompute products can be even more volatile and unpredictable than the demand for client compute products in some cases our products manufactured for client noncompute applications are uniquely configured for a single customers application which creates a risk of unwanted and unsellable inventory if the anticipated volumes are not realized this potential for unpredictable volatility is increased by the possibility of competing alternative storage technologies like flash memory meeting the customers cost and capacity metrics resulting in a rapid shift in demand from our products and disk drive technology generally to alternative storage technologies unpredictable fluctuations in demand for our products or rapid shifts in demand from our products to alternative storage technologies in new client noncompute applications could materially adversely impact our future results of operations 

dependence on sales of disk drives directly to consumers through retail outlets—our sales of disk drives directly to consumers through retail outlets can experience significant volatility due to seasonal and other factors which could materially adversely impact our future results of operations 

we believe that industry demand for storage products in the longterm is increasing due to the proliferation of mediarich digital content in consumer applications and is fuelling increased consumer demand for storage this has led to the expansion of solutions such as external storage products to provide additional storage capacity and to secure data in case of disaster or system failure or to provide independent storage solutions for multiple users in home or small business environments consumer spending on retail sales of our branded solutions has deteriorated in some markets and may continue to do so if poor global economic conditions continue and higher levels of unemployment persist this could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services and on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition such retail sales of our branded solutions traditionally experience seasonal variability in demand with higher levels of demand in the first half of our fiscal year driven by consumer spending in the backtoschool season from late summer to fall and the traditional holiday shopping season from fall to winter additionally our ability to reach such consumers depends on our maintaining effective working relationships with major retailers and distributors failure to anticipate consumer demand for our branded 

solutions as well as an inability to maintain effective working relationships with retail and online distributors may adversely impact our future results of operations 

importance of controlling operating costs—if we do not control our operating expenses we will not be able to compete effectively in our industry 

our strategy involves to a substantial degree increasing revenue and product volume while at the same time controlling operating expenses if we do not control our operating expenses our ability to compete in the marketplace may be impaired in the past activities to reduce operating costs have included closures and transfers of facilities significant personnel reductions and efforts to increase automation the reduction of personnel and closure of facilities may adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in required volumes to meet customer demand and may result in other disruptions that affect our products and customer service in addition the transfer of manufacturing capacity of a product to a different facility frequently requires qualification of the new facility by some of our oem customers we cannot assure you that these activities and transfers will be implemented on a costeffective basis without delays or disruption in our production and without adversely affecting our customer relationships and results of operations 

impairment charges—we may be required to record additional impairment charges for other longlived assets 

we are required to test other longlived assets including acquired intangible assets and property equipment and leasehold improvements for recoverability and impairment whenever there are indicators of impairment such as an adverse change in business climate 

adverse changes in business conditions could materially impact our estimates of future operations and result in impairment charges to our long lived assets if our longlived assets were to become further impaired our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

dependence on key customers—we may be adversely affected by the loss of or reduced delayed or cancelled purchases by one or more of our larger customers 

some of our key customers including hewlettpackard company dell inc and emc corporation account for a large portion of our disk drive revenue while we have longstanding relationships with many of our customers if any of our key customers were to significantly reduce their purchases from us our results of operations would be adversely affected while sales to major customers may vary from period to period a major customer that permanently discontinues or significantly reduces its relationship with us could be difficult to replace in line with industry practice new customers usually require that we pass a lengthy and rigorous qualification process at the customers cost accordingly it may be difficult or costly for us to attract new major customers additionally mergers acquisitions consolidations or other significant transactions involving our customers generally entail risks to our business if a significant transaction involving any of our key customers results in the loss of or reduction in purchases by these key customers it could have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and prospects 

impact of technological change—increases in the areal density of disk drives may outpace customers demand for storage capacity 

the rate of increase in areal density or storage capacity per square inch on a disk may be greater than the increase in our customers demand for aggregate storage capacity particularly in certain market applications like client compute as a result our customers storage capacity needs may be satisfied with lower priced low capacity disk drives these factors could decrease our sales especially when combined with continued price erosion which could adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in electronic data storage products—future changes in the nature of electronic data storage products may reduce demand for traditional disk drive products 

we expect that in the future new personal computing devices and products will be developed some of which such as internet appliances ipadlike tablet computing devices netbooks or mobile phones with advanced capabilities or smartphones may not contain a disk drive while we are investing development resources in designing disk drives for these new applications it is too early to assess the impact of these new applications on future demand for disk drive products products using alternative technologies such as flash memory optical storage and other storage technologies are becoming increasingly common and could become a significant source of competition to particular applications of our products which could adversely affect our results of operations 

new product development and technological change—if we do not develop products in time to keep pace with technological changes our results of operations will be adversely affected 

our customers have demanded new generations of disk drive products as advances in computer hardware and software have created the need for improved storage products with features such as increased storage capacity improved performance and reliability and lower cost we and our competitors have developed improved products and we will need to continue to do so in the future such product development requires significant investments in research and development we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully complete the design or introduction of new products in a timely manner that we will be able to manufacture new products in sufficient volumes with acceptable manufacturing yields that we will be able to successfully market these new products or that these products will perform to specifications on a longterm basis in addition the impact of slowing areal density growth may adversely impact our ability to be successful 

when we develop new products with higher capacity and more advanced technology our results of operations may decline because the increased difficulty and complexity associated with producing these products increases the likelihood of reliability quality or operability problems if our products suffer increases in failures are of low quality or are not reliable customers may reduce their purchases of our products and our manufacturing rework and scrap costs and service and warranty costs may increase in addition a decline in the reliability of our products may make us less competitive as compared with other disk drive manufacturers or competing technologies 

substantial leverage—our substantial leverage may place us at a competitive disadvantage in our industry 

we are leveraged and have significant debt service obligations our significant debt and debt service requirements could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities for example our high level of debt presents the following risks 

• we are required to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements • our substantial leverage increases our vulnerability to economic downturns and adverse competitive and industry conditions and could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that are less leveraged • our debt service obligations could limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry and could limit our ability to pursue other business opportunities borrow more money for operations or capital in the future and implement our business strategies 28 

• our level of debt may restrict us from raising additional financing on satisfactory terms to fund working capital capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements and • covenants in our debt instruments limit our ability to pay future dividends or make other restricted payments and investments in the event that we need to refinance all or a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures we may not be able to obtain terms as favorable as the terms of our existing debt or refinance our existing debt at all if prevailing interest rates or other factors existing at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing then the interest expense relating to the refinanced debt would increase furthermore if any rating agency changes our credit rating or outlook our debt and equity securities could be negatively affected which could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt or raise additional capital 

significant debt service requirements—servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate cash may be affected by factors beyond our control 

our business may not generate cash flow in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay the principal of or interest on our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs including working capital capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements 

our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control we cannot assure you that 

• our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations • we will continue to realize the cost savings revenue growth and operating improvements that result from the execution of our longterm strategic plan or • future sources of funding will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs if we cannot fund our liquidity needs we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements we cannot assure you that any of these remedies could if necessary be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all or that they would permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations in addition if we incur additional debt the risks associated with our substantial leverage including the risk that we will be unable to service our debt or generate enough cash flow to fund our liquidity needs could intensify 

restrictions imposed by debt covenants—restrictions imposed by the indenture governing our 10 senior secured secondpriority notes due 2014 may limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in our interest 

the indenture governing our 10 senior secured secondpriority notes due 2014 the 10 notes impose and the terms of any future debt may impose operating and other restrictions on us the indenture limits among other things our ability to 

• incur additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock • create liens • pay dividends or make distributions in respect of our capital stock • redeem or repurchase capital stock or debt 29 

• make certain investments or other restricted payments • sell assets • issue or sell capital stock of subsidiaries • enter into transactions with affiliates • engage to any material extent in business other than our current business and • effect a consolidation or merger substantially all of our assets are pledged as collateral to secure certain indebtedness—since substantially all of our assets are used to secure portions of our existing debt obligations we may be limited in our ability to incur additional indebtedness or to provide additional credit support and if we fail to meet our payment or other obligations under certain of our existing debt obligations the lenders thereunder could foreclose on and acquire control of substantially all of our assets 

substantially all our assets and the assets of our significant subsidiaries organized in the united states the cayman islands the netherlands northern ireland and singapore as well as certain assets located in the united states the cayman islands the netherlands northern ireland and singapore owned by other significant subsidiaries and all proceeds therefrom are pledged as security for borrowings under our 10 notes as well as obligations under our hedging agreements cash management arrangements and certain metal leasing arrangements since substantially all of our assets are used to secure portions of our existing debt obligations we have a limited amount of collateral that is available for future secured debt or credit support as a result we may be limited in our ability to incur additional indebtedness or to provide additional credit support for our existing indebtedness in addition our failure to comply with the terms of the indenture governing our 10 notes would entitle the lenders thereunder to declare all funds borrowed thereunder to be immediately due and payable if we were unable to meet these payment obligations the lenders could foreclose on and acquire control of substantially all our assets that serve as collateral 

volatile public markets—the price of our ordinary shares may be volatile and could decline significantly 

the stock market in general and the market for technology stocks in particular has recently experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of companies if these market or industrybased fluctuations continue the trading price of our ordinary shares could decline significantly independent of our actual operating performance and you could lose all or a substantial part of your investment the market price of our ordinary shares could fluctuate significantly in response to several factors including among others 

• general uncertainty in stock market conditions occasioned by global economic conditions negative financial news and the continued instability of several large financial institutions • actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations • announcements of innovations new products or significant price reductions by us or our competitors including those competitors who offer alternative storage technology solutions • our failure to meet the performance estimates of investment research analysts • the timing of announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts or acquisitions • general stock market conditions • the occurrence of major catastrophic events • changes in financial estimates by investment research analysts • changes in the credit ratings of our indebtedness by rating agencies and • the sale of our ordinary shares held by certain equity investors or members of management 30 

purchase commitments to certain suppliers—if revenues fall or customer demand decreases significantly we may not meet all of our purchase commitments to certain suppliers 

from time to time we enter into longterm noncancelable purchase commitments with certain suppliers in order to secure certain components for the production of our products or to supplement our internal manufacturing capacity for certain components if our actual revenues in the future are lower than our projections or if customer demand decreases significantly below our projections we may not meet all of our purchase commitments with these suppliers as a result it is possible that we will have to shift output from our internal manufacturing facilities to these suppliers or make penaltytype payments under these contracts 

perpendicular recording technology—products based on perpendicular technology require increased quantities of precious metals and scarce alloys like platinum and ruthenium which increase the risks of higher costs and production delays that could adversely impact our results of operations 

perpendicular recording technology requires recording media with more layers which requires the use of more precious metals and scarce alloys like platinum and ruthenium to create such layers these precious metals and scarce alloys could become increasingly expensive and at times difficult to acquire accordingly we will be exposed to the increased risk that higher costs or reduced availability of these precious metals and scarce alloys could adversely impact our results of operations 

risks associated with future strategic alliances joint ventures or investments—we may not be able to identify suitable strategic alliances acquisitions joint ventures or investment opportunities or successfully acquire and integrate companies that provide complementary products or technologies 

our growth strategy may involve pursuing strategic alliances with making acquisitions of forming joint ventures with or making investments in other companies that are complementary to our business there is substantial competition for attractive strategic alliance acquisition joint venture and investment candidates accordingly we may not be able to identify suitable strategic alliances acquisition joint venture or investment candidates even if we can identify them we cannot assure you that we will be able to partner with acquire or invest in suitable candidates or integrate acquired technologies or operations successfully into our existing technologies and operations moreover our ability to finance potential strategic alliances acquisitions joint ventures or investments will be limited by our high degree of leverage the covenants contained in the indentures that govern our outstanding indebtedness and any agreements governing any other debt we may incur 

if we are successful in forming strategic alliances or acquiring forming joint ventures or making investments in other companies any of these transactions may have an adverse effect on our results of operations particularly while the operations of an acquired business are being integrated it is also likely that integration of acquired companies would lead to the loss of key employees from those companies or the loss of customers of those companies in addition the integration of any acquired companies would require substantial attention from our senior management which may limit the amount of time available to be devoted to our daytoday operations or to the execution of our strategy growth by strategic alliance acquisition joint venture or investment involves an even higher degree of risk to the extent we combine new product offerings and enter new markets in which we have limited experience and no assurance can be given that acquisitions of entities with new or alternative business models will be successfully integrated or achieve their stated objectives 

furthermore the expansion of our business involves the risk that we might not manage our growth effectively that we would incur additional debt to finance these acquisitions or investments that we may have impairment of goodwill or acquired intangible assets associated with these acquisitions and that we would incur substantial charges relating to the writeoff of inprocess research and development similar to 

that which we incurred in connection with several of our prior acquisitions each of these items could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we could issue additional ordinary shares in connection with future strategic alliances acquisitions joint ventures or investments issuing shares in connection with such transactions would have the effect of diluting your ownership percentage of the ordinary shares and could cause the price of our ordinary shares to decline 

risk of intellectual property litigation—our products may infringe the intellectual property rights of others which may cause us to incur unexpected costs or prevent us from selling our products 

we cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of others we may not be aware of currently filed patent applications that relate to our products or technology if patents are later issued on these applications we may be liable for infringement we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims including claims of alleged infringement of the patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties by us or our customers in connection with their use of our products 

we are currently subject to lawsuits involving intellectual property claims which could cause us to incur significant additional costs or prevent us from selling our products and which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition actions brought in the united states by convolve inc and the massachusetts institute of technology and by qimonda ag and an action brought in northern ireland by siemens ag 

intellectual property litigation is expensive and timeconsuming regardless of the merits of any claim and could divert our managements attention from operating our business in addition intellectual property lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties due to the complexity of the technical issues involved and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in defending ourselves against intellectual property claims patent litigation has increased due to the current uncertainty of the law and the increasing competition and overlap of product functionality in the field if we were to discover that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of others we would need to obtain licenses from these parties or substantially reengineer our products in order to avoid infringement we might not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms or at all or be able to reengineer our products successfully moreover if we are sued for patent infringement and lose the suit we could be required to pay substantial damages andor be enjoined from using or selling the infringing products or technology any of the foregoing could cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling our products which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition see part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data—note 13 legal environmental and other contingencies of this annual report on form 10k for a description of pending intellectual property proceedings 

system failures—system failures caused by events beyond our control could adversely affect computer equipment and electronic data on which our operations depend 

our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer equipment and the electronic data stored in our databases from damage by among other things earthquake fire natural disaster power loss telecommunications failures unauthorized intrusion and other catastrophic events as our operations become more automated and increasingly interdependent our exposure to the risks posed by these types of events will increase while we continue to improve our disaster recovery processes system failures and other interruptions in our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

economic risks associated with international operations—our international operations subject us to risks related to currency exchange fluctuations longer payment cycles for sales in foreign countries seasonality and disruptions in foreign markets tariffs and duties price controls potential adverse tax consequences increased costs our customers credit and access to capital and healthrelated risks 

we have significant operations in foreign countries including manufacturing facilities sales personnel and customer support operations we have manufacturing facilities in china malaysia northern ireland singapore and thailand in addition to those in the united states a substantial portion of our client compute disk drive assembly occurs in our facility in china 

our international operations are subject to economic risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries including the following 

• disruptions in foreign markets disruptions in financial markets and the deterioration of the underlying economic conditions in the past in some countries including those in asia have had an impact on our sales to customers located in or whose enduser customers are located in these countries • fluctuations in currency exchange rates prices for our products are denominated predominately in us dollars even when sold to customers that are located outside the united states currency instability in asia and other geographic markets may make our products more expensive than products sold by other manufacturers that are priced in the local currency moreover many of the costs associated with our operations located outside the united states are denominated in local currencies as a consequence the increased strength of local currencies against the us dollar in countries where we have foreign operations would result in higher effective operating costs and potentially reduced earnings from time to time fluctuations in foreign exchange rates have negatively affected our operations and profitability and there can be no assurance that these fluctuations will not adversely affect our operations and profitability in the future • longer payment cycles our customers outside of the united states are often allowed longer time periods for payment than our us customers this increases the risk of nonpayment due to the possibility that the financial condition of particular customers may worsen during the course of the payment period • seasonality seasonal reductions in the business activities of our customers during the summer months particularly in europe typically result in lower earnings during those periods • tariffs duties limitations on trade and price controls our international operations are affected by limitations on imports currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations price controls and other restraints on trade in addition the governments of many countries including china malaysia northern ireland singapore and thailand in which we have significant operating assets have exercised and continue to exercise significant influence over many aspects of their domestic economies and international trade • potential adverse tax consequences our international operations create a risk of potential adverse tax consequences including imposition of withholding or other taxes on payments by subsidiaries • increased costs the shipping and transportation costs associated with our international operations are typically higher than those associated with our us operations resulting in decreased operating margins in some foreign countries • credit and access to capital risks our international customers could have reduced access to working capital due to higher interest rates reduced bank lending resulting from contractions in the money supply or the deterioration in the customers or its banks financial condition or the inability to access other financing 33 

• global health outbreaks the occurrence of a pandemic disease may adversely impact our operations and some of our key customers such diseases could also potentially disrupt the timeliness and reliability of the distribution network we rely on political risks associated with international operations—our international operations subject us to risks related to political unrest and terrorism 

we have manufacturing facilities in parts of the world that periodically experience political unrest with thailand being a recent example this could disrupt our ability to manufacture important components as well as cause interruptions andor delays in our ability to ship components to other locations for continued manufacture and assembly any such delays or interruptions could result in delays in our ability to fill orders and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition us and international responses to the ongoing hostilities in afghanistan and iraq and the risk of terrorist attacks or hostilities elsewhere in the world could exacerbate these risks 

legal and operational risks associated with international operations—our international operations subject us to risks related to staffing and management legal and regulatory requirements and the protection of intellectual property 

operating outside of the united states creates difficulties associated with staffing and managing our international manufacturing facilities complying with local legal and regulatory requirements and protecting our intellectual property we cannot assure you that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with applicable customs currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which we may be subject we also cannot assure you that these laws will not be modified 

sox 404 compliance—while we believe that we currently have adequate internal control procedures in place we are still exposed to future risks of noncompliance and will continue to incur costs associated with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 

annually we complete an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as required by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 although our assessment testing and evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of july 2 2010 our internal control over financial reporting was effective we cannot predict the outcome of our testing in future periods if our internal controls are ineffective in future periods our financial results or the market price of our shares could be adversely affected we will incur additional expenses and commitment of managements time in connection with further evaluations 

dependence on key personnel—the loss of key executive officers and employees could negatively impact our business prospects 

our future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued service of key members of management as well as marketing sales and product development personnel the loss of one or more of our key personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we believe our future success will also depend in large part upon our ability to attract retain and further motivate highly skilled management marketing sales and product development personnel we have experienced intense competition for personnel and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our key employees or that we will be successful in attracting assimilating and retaining personnel in the future 

suspension of paying quarterly dividends—our policy of not paying dividends could result in a persistently low market valuation of our ordinary shares 

on april 13 2009 we announced that we had adopted a policy of no longer paying a quarterly dividend to our ordinary shareholders to enhance liquidity our policy of not paying a quarterly dividend could result in a persistently low market valuation of our ordinary shares 

our ability to pay quarterly dividends in the future will be subject to among other things general business conditions within the disk drive industry our financial results the impact of paying dividends on our credit ratings and legal and contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends by our subsidiaries to us or by us to our ordinary shareholders 

potential governmental action—governmental action against companies located in offshore jurisdictions may lead to a reduction in the demand for our ordinary shares 

recent us federal and state legislation has been proposed and additional legislation may be proposed in the future which if enacted could have an adverse tax impact on either seagate or its shareholders 

securities litigation—significant fluctuations in the market price of our ordinary shares could result in securities class action claims against us 

significant price and value fluctuations have occurred with respect to the publicly traded securities of disk drive companies and technology companies generally the price of our ordinary shares is likely to be volatile in the future in the past following periods of decline in the market price of a companys securities class action lawsuits have often been pursued against that company if similar litigation were pursued against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources which could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

current global credit and financial market conditions—current global credit and financial market conditions could negatively impact the value of our current portfolio of cash equivalents shortterm investments or auction rate securities and our ability to meet our financing objectives 

our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase our shortterm investments consist primarily of readily marketable debt securities with remaining maturities of more than 90 days at the time of purchase our investment policy has as its principal objectives the preservation of principal and maintenance of liquidity we mitigate default risk by investing in highquality investment grade securities limiting the time to maturity and by monitoring the counterparties and underlying obligors closely 

as of july 2 2010 we continued to hold auction rate securities with a par value of approximately 19 million all of which are collateralized by student loans guaranteed by the federal family education loan program beginning in the march 2008 quarter these securities have continuously failed to settle at auction as of july 2 2010 the estimated fair value of these auction rate securities was 17 million we believe that the impairments totaling 2 million are temporary as we do not intend to sell these securities and have concluded it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the securities before the recovery of the amortized cost basis 

while as of the date of this filing we are not aware of any other material downgrades losses or other significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or shortterm investments or auction rate securities since july 2 2010 no assurance can be given that further deterioration in conditions of the global credit and financial markets would not negatively impact our current portfolio of cash equivalents shortterm investments or auction rate securities or our ability to meet our financing objectives 

environmental regulations—failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the sale and manufacturing of products in certain states and countries may subject us to environmental and other regulations including in some instances the responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling for example the eu has enacted the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment directive which prohibits the use of certain substances in electronic equipment and the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive which obligates parties that place electrical and electronic equipment onto the market in the eu to put a clearly identifiable mark on the equipment register with and report to eu member countries regarding distribution of the equipment and provide a mechanism to takeback and properly dispose of the equipment similar legislation may be enacted in other locations where we manufacture or sell our products although we do not anticipate any material adverse effects based on the nature of our operations and the focus of such legislation we will need to ensure that we comply with these laws and regulations as they are enacted and that our suppliers also comply with these laws and regulations if we fail to timely comply with the legislation our customers may refuse to purchase our products which would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition if we were found to be in violation of these laws or noncompliance with these initiatives or standards of conduct we could be subject to governmental fines liability to our customers and damage to our reputation which would also have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

dividends 

in 2009 we adopted a policy of no longer paying a quarterly dividend to our shareholders to enhance liquidity the suspension of paying quarterly dividends could cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline significantly and our failure or inability to resume paying dividends at historical levels could result in a persistently low market valuation of our ordinary shares we currently do not anticipate paying a dividend for the foreseeable future 

our ability to pay quarterly dividends in the future will be subject to among other things general business conditions within the disk drive industry our financial results the impact of paying dividends on our credit ratings and legal and contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends by our subsidiaries to us or by us to our ordinary shareholders including restrictions imposed by covenants in our debt instruments 

since the closing of our initial public offering in december 2002 up to our policy change in 2009 we have paid dividends pursuant to our quarterly dividend policy then in effect totaling approximately 952 million in the aggregate the following are dividends paid in the last two fiscal years 



repurchases of our equity securities 

on january 27 2010 our board of directors authorized an antidilution share repurchase program which was publicly announced on february 1 2010 the repurchase program authorizes us to repurchase our shares to offset increases in diluted shares such as those caused by employee stock plans and convertible debt used in the determination of diluted net income per share the timing and number of shares to be repurchased by us will be dependent on general business and market conditions cash flows generated by future operations the price of our shares cash requirements for other investing and financing activities and maintaining compliance with our debt covenants repurchases may be made through open market or in privately negotiated transactions pursuant to rule 10b51 trading plans or other available means such as by way of an accelerated share repurchase program through block trades or through the purchase of call options or the sale of put options additionally there is no minimum or maximum number of shares to be repurchased under the program and the authority for the antidilution share repurchase program will continue until terminated by our board of directors

• critical accounting estimates accounting estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results our company 

we are the worlds leading provider of hard disk drives based on revenue we design manufacture market and sell hard disk drives hard disk drives commonly referred to as disk drives hard drives or hdds are devices that store digitally encoded data on rapidly rotating disks with magnetic surfaces the performance attributes of disk drives including their cost effectiveness and high storage capacities have resulted in disk drives being used as the primary medium for storing electronic data 

we produce a broad range of disk drive products addressing enterprise applications where our products are designed for enterprise servers mainframes and workstations client compute applications where our products are designed for desktop and notebook computers and client noncompute applications where our products are designed for a wide variety of end user devices such as digital video recorders dvrs personal data backup systems portable external storage systems and digital media systems in addition to manufacturing and selling disk drives we provide data storage services for small to mediumsized businesses including online backup data protection and recovery solutions 

business overview 

our industry is characterized by several trends and factors that have a material impact on our strategic planning financial condition and results of operations 

demand trends for disk drives 

we believe the total available market tam for disk drives in aggregate increased approximately 22 in fiscal year 2010 over the prior fiscal year we believe that continued growth in digital content requires increasingly higher storage capacity in order to store aggregate host distribute manage back up and use such content which we believe will continue to result in increased demand for disk drive products however the disk drive industry is sensitive to global macroeconomic conditions as experienced in fiscal year 2009 

historically the electronic data storage industry has introduced alternative technologies that directly compete with hard disk drives solid state drives ssds using nand flash memory are a potential alternative to disk drives in certain applications such as consumer handheld devices and portable external storage nand flash memory is a type of nonvolatile storage technology that does not require power to retain data however we believe that in the foreseeable future the traditional enterprise and client compute markets that require high capacity storage solutions as well as the data intensive client noncompute markets will continue to be best served by hard disk drives based on the industrys ability to deliver reliable power consumption efficient and cost effective mass storage devices 

disk drives for enterprise storage we define enterprise storage as disk drives designed for mission critical applications and nearline applications 

mission critical applications are defined as applications that are vital to the operation of enterprises requiring high performance and high reliability disk drives we expect the market for mission critical enterprise storage solutions to be driven by enterprises continuing to move network traffic to dedicated storage area networks in an effort to reduce network complexity and increase energy savings we believe that this transition will lead to an increased demand for more energy efficient smaller form factor disk drives these solutions are comprised principally of high performance enterprise class disk drives with sophisticated firmware and communications technologies 

nearline applications are defined as applications that are less timecritical but capacityintensive such as reference data environments or redundancy for recovery purposes which require high capacity and low power consumption disk drives featuring lower costs per gigabyte we expect such applications which 

include storage for cloud computing and backup services will continue to grow and drive demand for disk drives designed with these attributes as data centers expand and proliferate 

we believe that the enterprise storage tam increased 21 as compared to the prior fiscal year due to the deferral of information technology equipment purchases experienced in fiscal year 2009 when storage utilization rates of existing disk drives in data centers increased 

ssd storage applications have been introduced as a potential alternative to redundant system startup or boot disk drives in addition enterprises are beginning to use ssds in applications where rapid processing andor lower power consumption is required the timing of significant adoption of ssds is dependent on enterprises weighing the pricing and other benefits of mission critical enterprise disk drives against the perceived performance benefits of ssds 

disk drives for client compute we define client compute applications as disk drives designed for the traditional desktop and mobile compute applications in the nearterm we believe that demand growth in client compute applications will be driven by what we believe to be an accelerating corporate technology refresh cycle in the longterm we believe that the proliferation of digital content will drive the demand for the client compute market we believe that the client compute storage tam increased 24 as compared to the prior fiscal year mainly due to the strength in consumer spending for technology for most of the 2010 fiscal year 

as the proliferation of client compute applications that require minimal storage such as tablets and netbooks continues nand flash technology could become more competitive within the client compute market in the future 

disk drives for client noncompute we define client noncompute applications as disk drives designed for consumer electronic devices and disk drives used for external and networkattached storage nas disk drives designed for consumer electronic devices are primarily used in applications such as dvrs that require a higher capacity lower costpergigabyte storage solution disk drives for external and nas devices are designed for purposes such as personal data backup portable external storage and to augment the consumers current desktop notebook or dvr disk drive capacities client noncompute applications also include devices designed to display digital media in the home theater we believe the proliferation of high definition and mediarich digital content will continue to create increasing consumer demand for higher storage solutions as evidenced by an increase in the client noncompute tam of 14 as compared to the prior fiscal year

our industry has been characterized by significant advances in technology which have contributed to rapid product life cycles as a result success in our industry has been dependent to a large extent on the ability to be the firsttomarket with new products allowing those disk drive manufacturers who introduce new products first to sell those products at a premium until comparable products are introduced also because our industry is characterized by continuous price erosion the existence of rapid product life cycles has necessitated quick achievement of product cost effectiveness changing technology also necessitates ongoing investments in research and development which may be difficult to recover due to rapid product life cycles and economic declines further there is a continued need to successfully execute product transitions and new product introductions as factors such as quality reliability and manufacturing yields become of increasing competitive importance 

price erosion 

our industry has been characterized by price declines for disk drive products with comparable capacity performance and feature sets likeforlike products price declines for likeforlike products price erosion are more pronounced during periods of 

• economic contraction or industry consolidation in which competitors may use discounted pricing to attempt to maintain or gain market share 46 

• few new product introductions when multiple competitors have comparable or alternative product offerings • temporary imbalances between industry supply and demand and • seasonally weaker demand which may cause excess supply disk drive manufacturers typically attempt to offset price erosion with an improved mix of disk drive products characterized by higher capacity better performance and additional feature sets andor product cost reductions to remain competitive we believe it will be necessary to continue to reduce prices as well as introduce new product offerings that utilize advanced technologies ahead of our competitors in order to take advantage of potentially higher initial profit margins and reduced cost structure on these new products 

we experienced muted price erosion for the first nine months of fiscal year 2010 as our industry experienced unmet demand due to industrywide supply constraints during the first half of fiscal year 2010 and a relatively balanced supply and demand environment during the march 2010 quarter however in the june 2010 quarter industry supply exceeded demand and resulted in an increase in price erosion to levels typical of a june quarter 

seasonality 

the disk drive industry traditionally experiences seasonal variability in demand with higher levels of demand in the second half of the calendar year this seasonality is driven by consumer spending in the backtoschool season from late summer to fall and the traditional holiday shopping season from fall to winter in addition corporate demand is typically higher during the second half of the calendar year for most of fiscal year 2010 our industry observed a muted seasonal pattern as the hard disk drive industry experienced unmet demand due to industrywide supply constraints while in the march 2010 quarter supply and demand were relatively balanced however in the june 2010 quarter industry supply exceeded demand which we believe reflected a return to seasonal patterns typical of a june quarter 

disk drive industry consolidation 

due to the significant challenges posed by the need to continually innovate and improve manufacturing efficiency and the continued demands on capital and research and development investments required to do so the disk drive industry has undergone significant consolidation as disk drive manufacturers and component manufacturers merged with other companies or exited the industry the trend toward consolidation is more pronounced during times of macroeconomic contraction for example toshiba corporation acquired fujitsu limiteds hard disk drive business in october 2009 the increasing technological challenges associated levels of investment and competitive necessity of largescale operations may also drive future industry consolidation additionally we may in the future face indirect competition from customers who from time to time evaluate whether to offer electronic data storage products that may compete with our products 

suppliers of components and industry constraints 

due to industry consolidation there are a limited number of independent suppliers of components such as recording heads and media available to disk drive manufacturers vertically integrated disk drive manufacturers who manufacture their own components are less dependent on external component suppliers than less vertically integrated disk drive manufacturers 

we believe the supply chain was generally tight for the industry during most of fiscal year 2010 availability of glass substrates finished media and heads improved during the june 2010 quarter however supply of these critical components is still expected to be generally tight for the second half of the 2010 calendar year reflecting typical seasonal patterns 

recording heads and media 

we maintain a highly integrated approach to our business by designing and manufacturing a significant portion of the components we view as critical to our products such as recording heads and media a vertically integrated model however tends to have less flexibility when demand moderates because it exposes us to higher unit costs as capacity utilization is not optimized the extent of our use of externally sourced recording heads media and aluminum substrates varies based on product mix technology and our internal capacity levels we purchase from third parties all of our glass substrates which we use to manufacture disk drives for our 25inch products 

commodity and other manufacturing costs 

the production of disk drives requires precious metals scarce alloys and industrial commodities which are subject to fluctuations in prices and the supply of which has at times been constrained we believe that currently there is an adequate supply of these precious metals scarce alloys and industrial commodities additionally volatility in fuel costs may increase our costs related to commodities manufacturing and freight as a result we may increase our use of ocean shipments to help offset any increase in freight costs 

industry supply balance 

from time to time the industry has experienced periods of imbalance between supply and demand to the extent that the disk drive industry builds capacity based on expectations of demand that do not materialize price erosion may become more pronounced conversely during periods where demand exceeds supply price erosion is generally muted for the first half of fiscal year 2010 our industry experienced unmet demand due to industrywide supply constraints while in the march 2010 quarter supply and demand were relatively balanced however in the june 2010 quarter industry supply exceeded demand which we believe reflected a return to seasonal patterns typical of a june quarter 

fiscal year 2010 summary 

revenues for fiscal year 2010 were 114 billion and gross margins were 28 which represented a 16 increase in revenues and growth in our gross margins from 14 in the prior fiscal year we shipped 193 million units during fiscal year 2010 which represents an 18 growth over the prior fiscal year this increase in revenue reflects an industrywide supply constraint experienced in the first half of fiscal year 2010 and a relatively balanced supply and demand environment during the march 2010 quarter resulting in muted price erosion however in the june 2010 quarter industry supply exceeded demand and resulted in an increase in price erosion to levels typical of a june quarter given that over 70 of seagates revenues are from sales to oems where pricing agreements are negotiated in advance of the quarter a large part of our business was insulated from price declines in the june 2010 quarter in the september 2010 quarter however we anticipate the adverse pricing environment will carry through to our entire product portfolio and will have a more pronounced impact on our gross margin 

we continued to strengthen our balance sheet in fiscal year 2010 we generated operating cash flow of 1932 million used approximately 584 million to repurchase 324 million of our common shares and used 639 million for capital expenditures in may 2010 we issued 600 million in aggregate principal amount of 6875 senior notes due may 2020 the 2020 notes additionally we repaid approximately 827 million in existing debt and shortterm borrowings during the year

fiscal year 2010 compared to fiscal year 2009 

revenue 



revenue in fiscal year 2010 increased approximately 16 or 16 billion from fiscal year 2009 primarily due to an 18 increase in the total number of disk drives shipped this increase in revenue reflects an industrywide supply constraint experienced in the first half of fiscal year 2010 and a relatively balanced supply and demand environment during the march 2010 quarter resulting in muted price erosion in the june 2010 quarter industry supply exceeded demand and resulted in an increase in price erosion to levels typical of a june quarter 

we maintain various sales programs such as pointofsale rebates sales price adjustments and price protection aimed at increasing customer demand we exercise judgment in formulating the underlying estimates related to distributor and retail inventory levels sales program participation and customer claims submittals in determining the provision for such programs sales programs recorded as contra revenue were approximately 6 and 12 of our gross revenue for fiscal years 2010 and 2009 respectively 

gross margin 



for fiscal year 2010 gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased to 28 from 14 in the prior fiscal year primarily as a result of an 18 increase in drive shipments muted price erosion a more costeffective product mix and a substantial improvement in manufacturing capacity utilization 

operating expenses 



1 as adjusted due to a required change in the accounting for convertible debt instruments implemented in the first quarter of 2010 applied on a retrospective basis 

product development expense product development expenses for fiscal year 2010 decreased approximately 8 from fiscal year 2009 primarily due to restructuring and other cost reduction efforts and the effect of an additional week of compensation expenses in fiscal year 2009 which was a 53week fiscal year these cost reduction efforts resulted in decreases of 66 million in headcount related expenses in fiscal year 2010 38 million due to the cessation of certain product development activities and 26 million due to the nonrecurrence of accelerated depreciation expense related to the closure of our pittsburgh facility these decreases were partially offset by increases of 48 million for variable performancebased compensation expense recorded in fiscal year 2010 compared to none in fiscal year 2009 and a 16 million benefit related to our deferred compensation plan recorded in fiscal year 2009 

marketing and administrative expense marketing and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2010 decreased approximately 19 from fiscal year 2009 primarily due to restructuring and other cost reduction efforts and the effect of an additional week of compensation expenses in fiscal year 2009 which was a 53week fiscal year these cost reduction efforts resulted in decreases of 69 million in headcount related expenses 26 million in advertising costs and 29 million in legal expenses these decreases were partially offset by increases of 28 million for variable performancebased compensation expense recorded in fiscal year 2010 compared to none in fiscal year 2009 and a 9 million benefit related to our deferred compensation plan recorded in fiscal year 2009 

amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles for fiscal year 2010 decreased approximately 51 from fiscal year 2009 as certain intangibles relating to the maxtor corporation maxtor and metalincs inc acquisitions have been fully amortized 

restructuring and other net during fiscal year 2010 we recorded restructuring and other charges of 66 million mainly comprised of charges related to our amk restructuring plan announced in august 2009 and additional restructuring charges related to our pittsburgh facility and facilities acquired as a part of the maxtor acquisition 

restructuring and other net decreased approximately 144 million when compared to the prior fiscal year which include restructuring plans announced in january and may 2009 that were intended to realign our cost structure with the fiscal year 2009 macroeconomic business environment see prior year explanation for further details 

impairment of goodwill and other longlived assets net of recoveries during fiscal year 2010 we committed to a plan to sell certain equipment related to certain research activities that had ceased in connection with this plan we reclassified these assets as held for sale and recorded a net impairment charge of approximately 57 million to adjust the carrying value of these assets to the estimated fair value less cost to sell 

impairment of goodwill and other longlived assets net of recoveries decreased approximately 22 billion when compared to the prior fiscal year due to the nonrecurrence of the 23 billion impairment charge we recorded in fiscal year 2009 as a result of the significant adverse change to our business climate see prior year explanation for further details 

other income expense net 



1 as adjusted due to a required change in the accounting for convertible debt instruments implemented in the first quarter of 2010 applied on a retrospective basis 

the change in other income expense net for fiscal year 2010 compared to fiscal year 2009 was primarily due to a 31 million increase in interest expense resulting from higher average borrowing costs a decrease in gains from foreign currency remeasurements of 15 million a 13 million writedown of an equity investment in fiscal year 2010 a 12 million decrease in interest income as a result of lower yields on our cash and investments and an 8 million nonrecurring gain recognized on the sale of an equity investment in fiscal year 2009 these were partially offset by a 44 million loss related to our deferred compensation plan assets recorded in fiscal year 2009 

income taxes 



1 as adjusted due to a required change in the accounting for convertible debt instruments implemented in the first quarter of 2010 applied on a retrospective basis 

we recorded an income tax benefit of 40 million for fiscal year 2010 compared to a provision for income taxes of 311 million for fiscal year 2009 our fiscal year 2009 provision for income taxes included 271 million of income tax expense recorded in the second quarter associated with an increase in our valuation allowance for us deferred tax assets related to a reduction in our forecasted us taxable income 

in connection with our previously announced plans to move our corporate headquarters to ireland we initiated certain prereorganization steps which resulted in our existing cayman parent holding company becoming an irish tax resident in fiscal year 2010 our irish tax resident parent holding company owns various us and nonus subsidiaries that operate in multiple nonirish taxing jurisdictions our worldwide operating income is either subject to varying rates of tax or is exempt from tax due to tax holidays or tax incentive programs we operate under in china malaysia singapore switzerland and thailand these tax holidays or incentives are scheduled to expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2020 

since we became an irish tax resident in fiscal year 2010 the irish statutory rate of 25 is used for purposes of the reconciliation between the provision for income taxes at the statutory rate and our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2009 and 2008 a notional 35 statutory rate was used 

our income tax benefit recorded for fiscal year 2010 differed from the provision benefit for income taxes that would be derived by applying the irish statutory rate of 25 to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i tax benefits related to earnings in countries where we have tax holidays and tax incentive programs which are indefinitely reinvested outside of ireland ii a decrease in valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets iii nonus losses with no tax benefit and iv tax expense related to intercompany transactions our provision for income taxes recorded for the comparative fiscal year ended july 3 2009 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying a notional us 35 rate to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i nondeductible goodwill impairments ii an increase in our valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets iii nonus losses with no tax benefit iv tax benefits related to tax holiday and tax incentive programs and v tax expense related to intercompany transactions 

based on our nonus ownership structure and subject to i potential future increases in our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and ii a future change in our intention to indefinitely reinvest earnings our subsidiaries outside of ireland we anticipate that our effective tax rate in future periods will generally be less than the irish statutory rate dividend distributions received from our us subsidiaries may be subject to us withholding taxes when and if distributed 

the amount of temporary differences including undistributed earnings related to outside basis differences in the stock of nonirish resident subsidiaries considered indefinitely reinvested outside of ireland for which irish income taxes have not been provided was approximately 27 billion the determination of the amount of irish tax that would accrue if such amount was remitted into ireland is not practicable 

at july 2 2010 our deferred tax asset valuation allowance was approximately 12 billion reflecting a decrease of approximately 133 million in fiscal year 2010 the decrease in the valuation allowance includes a 55 million reversal of a portion of the us valuation allowance recorded in fiscal year 2009 associated with revisions to our forecasts of us taxable income and a decrease associated with the utilization of tax net operating loss carry forwards in fiscal year 2010 as of july 3 2009 the deferred tax asset valuation allowance was approximately 13 billion reflecting an increase of approximately 864 million in fiscal year 2009 the increase in valuation allowance resulted primarily from the liquidation of our wholly owned subsidiary maxtor effective june 1 2009 and represented the net effects of the extinguishment of all deferred tax assets related to historical carryover tax attributes of maxtor and the increase in deferred tax assets related to tax net operating losses incurred in connection with the liquidation transaction 

at july 2 2010 we had net deferred tax assets of 505 million the realization of 473 million of these deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on our ability to generate sufficient us and certain nonus taxable income in future periods although realization is not assured we believe that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable however may increase or decrease in subsequent periods when we reevaluate the underlying basis for our estimates of future us and certain nonus taxable income 

during fiscal year ended july 2 2010 an enacted legislative change in us tax law was taken into account in computing our income tax provision the worker homeownership and business assistance act of 2009 was enacted on november 6 2009 this law allowed us to elect an increased carryback period for net operating losses incurred in 2008 or 2009 from two years to three four or five years at our option we recorded an 11 million income tax benefit as a result of the increased carryback period 

approximately 461 million and 93 million of our us net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards respectively are subject to an annual limitation of 448 million pursuant to us tax law 

effective at the beginning of fiscal year 2008 we adopted the authoritative guidance on accounting for uncertain tax positions in income taxes this guidance contains a twostep approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

as a result of the implementation of the guidance we increased our liability for net unrecognized tax benefits at the date of adoption we accounted for the increase primarily as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle that resulted in a decrease to retained earnings of 3 million and an increase to goodwill of 25 million the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits as of the date of adoption was 385 million excluding interest and penalties 

as of july 2 2010 and july 3 2009 we had approximately 115 million and 118 million respectively in unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties the unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would impact the effective tax rate were 115 million and 118 million as of july 2 2010 and july 3 2009 respectively subject to certain future valuation allowance reversals 

it is our policy to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for taxes on the consolidated statements of operations during fiscal year 2010 we recognized a net benefit for interest and penalties of 1 million as compared to a net benefit of 6 million during fiscal year 2009 as of july 2 2010 we had 15 million of accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as compared to 16 million as of july 3 2009 

during the fiscal year ended july 2 2010 our unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties decreased by approximately 3 million primarily due to i reductions associated with the expiration of certain statutes of limitation of 3 million ii reductions associated with effectively settled positions of 4 million iii a reduction of 5 million associated with interpretation of tax law as a result of the final 9 th circuit court of appeals decision relating to stock based compensation deductions iv increases in current year unrecognized tax benefits of 6 million and v increases from other activity including nonus exchange losses of 3 million 

during the 12 months beginning july 3 2010 we expect to reduce our unrecognized tax benefits by approximately 5 million as a result of the expiration of certain statutes of limitation we do not believe it is reasonably possible that other unrecognized tax benefits will materially change in the next 12 months however the resolution andor timing of closure on open audits are highly uncertain as to when these events occur 

we file us federal us state and nonus tax returns the internal revenue service irs is currently examining fiscal years 2005 through 2007 for state and nonus tax returns we are generally no longer subject to tax examinations for years prior to fiscal year 2001 the statute of limitation for us federal returns is open for fiscal year 2005 and forward 

fiscal year 2009 compared to fiscal year 2008 

revenue 



revenue in fiscal year 2009 decreased approximately 23 or 29 billion from fiscal year 2008 primarily due to declining global macroeconomic conditions these conditions resulted in a 10 decrease in the number of disk drives shipped and a 13 reduction in our asp from 68 to 59 per unit the decrease in our asp as compared to fiscal year 2008 resulted from an unfavorable product mix as higherpriced enterprise drives comprised a smaller percentage of the units shipped and a near doubledigit price erosion during each of the first two quarters of fiscal year 2009 the near doubledigit price erosion we experienced was due to timetomarket delays in certain markets and a supply and demand imbalance resulting from a sharp decline in the tam in the december 2008 quarter sales programs recorded as contra revenue were approximately 12 and 9 of our gross revenue for fiscal years 2009 and 2008 respectively 

gross margin 



for fiscal year 2009 gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased 1100 basis points primarily due to price erosion lower capacity utilization particularly in the december 2008 and the march 2009 quarters and the delay in transitioning to more marketcompetitive and costefficient products in certain markets due to the residual effects of fiscal year 2008 execution issues in the december 2008 quarter the supply and demand imbalance resulted in a very competitive pricing environment and significant price erosion especially in the 35inch and 25inch ata markets 

operating expenses 



1 as adjusted due to a required change in the accounting for convertible debt instruments implemented in the first quarter of 2010 applied on a retrospective basis 

product development expense the decrease in product development expense for fiscal year 2009 was primarily due to 82 million of variable performancebased compensation expense in fiscal year 2008 while none was recognized in fiscal year 2009 restructuring and other cost reduction efforts contributed to a further 35 million reduction in product development expenses as compared to fiscal year 2008 these cost reduction measures included the closure of the pittsburgh facility headcount reductions and wage decreases that took place in the second half of fiscal year 2009 in addition other employee benefits decreased by 20 million due to changes in deferred compensation plan liabilities and a 13 million research grant was received in fiscal year 2009 these decreases were partially offset by a 23 million increase in payroll expense due to annual wage increases and a 53week fiscal year in 2009 compared to 

52 weeks in fiscal year 2008 20 million in operating expenses resulting from increased product development and licensing activities and 26 million of accelerated depreciation expense related to the closure of our pittsburgh facility 

marketing and administrative expense the decrease in marketing and administrative expense for fiscal year 2009 was primarily due to 53 million of variable performancebased compensation expense in fiscal year 2008 while none was recognized in fiscal year 2009 in the second half of the fiscal year 2009 restructuring and other cost reduction efforts contributed to further reductions of 25 million in wages 29 million for reduced use of consultants and outside services and 15 million as a result of reduced travel additionally other employee benefits decreased by 11 million due to changes in deferred compensation plan liabilities these decreases were partially offset by a 14 million increase in payroll expense due to annual wage increases and a 53week fiscal year in 2009 compared to 52 weeks in fiscal year 2008 

amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles was relatively flat for fiscal year 2009 when compared to fiscal year 2008 

restructuring and other net during fiscal year 2009 we recorded restructuring and other charges of 210 million comprised mainly of charges related to the restructuring plans announced in january and may 2009 both intended to realign our cost structure with the macroeconomic business environment these charges consisted of 173 million of employee termination benefits 31 million related to lease obligations associated with the site closures and 6 million of other exit costs as of the dates we committed to these restructuring plans we estimated annual savings upon completion of 130 million and 125 million from the january and may 2009 restructuring plans respectively and 30 million 42 million and 34 million from the pittsburgh milpitas and limavady site closures respectively 

impairment of goodwill and other longlived assets during the december 2008 quarter we determined that a significant adverse change to our business climate had occurred which required that we evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill and other longlived assets principally intangible assets and property equipment and leasehold improvements for impairment we made this determination as evidence of a sustained and sharp deterioration in the general business environment and specifically all of our major markets was building rapidly through the quarter several of our customers and other technology companies in the supply chain of our customers as well as our competitors reduced their financial outlook andor otherwise disclosed that they were experiencing very challenging market conditions with little visibility of a rebound in addition prior to the start of the december quarter the tam was estimated to be approximately 156 million units at about eight weeks into the quarter the outlook for the tam had decreased to be approximately 135 million units after the close of the quarter preliminary industry data indicated actual shipments for the december quarter were approximately 123 million units in response to these adverse business indicators and the rapidly declining revenue trends experienced during our fiscal second quarter we reduced our nearterm and longterm financial projections consequently we performed an analysis of goodwill for impairment and of the recoverability and impairment of other longlived assets in accordance with the guidance in financial accounting standards boards fasb accounting standards codification asc topic 350 intangibles—goodwill and other previously statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  and asc 360 property plant and equipment previously sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets  respectively based on these analyses we recorded impairment charges of 23 billion for goodwill and 3 million for other longlived assets see critical accounting policies herein for further details 

other income expense net 



1 as adjusted due to a required change in the accounting for convertible debt instruments implemented in the first quarter of 2010 applied on a retrospective basis 

the change in other income expense net was primarily due to a 40 million decrease in interest income as a result of lower yields on cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments and a 38 million decline in the value of the deferred compensation plan assets the corresponding gain or loss on deferred compensation plan liabilities is primarily reported in operating expenses 

income taxes 



1 as adjusted due to a required change in the accounting for convertible debt instruments implemented in the first quarter of 2010 applied on a retrospective basis 

we recorded a provision for income taxes of 311 million for fiscal year 2009 compared to a provision for income taxes of 67 million for fiscal year 2008 our fiscal year 2009 provision for income taxes included 271 million of income tax expense recorded in the second quarter associated with an increase in our valuation allowance for us deferred tax assets related to a reduction in our forecasted us taxable income 

we were a nonus holding company incorporated in the cayman islands with us and nonus subsidiaries that operate in multiple taxing jurisdictions as a result our worldwide operating income was either subject to varying rates of tax or was exempt from tax due to tax holidays or tax incentive programs we operated under in china malaysia singapore switzerland and thailand these tax holidays or incentives were scheduled to expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2020 

our provision for income taxes for fiscal year 2009 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying a notional us 35 rate to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i nondeductible goodwill impairments ii an increase in our valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets iii nonus losses with no tax benefit iv tax benefits related to tax holiday and tax incentive programs and v tax expense related to intercompany transactions our provision for income taxes recorded for fiscal year ended june 27 2008 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying a notional us 35 rate to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i tax benefits related to tax holiday and tax incentive programs ii a decrease in our valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets and iii tax expense related to intercompany transactions 

in fiscal year 2009 the deferred tax asset valuation allowance was approximately 13 billion the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets increased by approximately 864 million in fiscal year 2009 the increase in valuation allowance resulted primarily from the liquidation of our wholly owned subsidiary maxtor effective june 1 2009 and represented the net effects of the extinguishment of all deferred tax assets related to historical carryover tax attributes of maxtor and the increase in deferred tax assets related to losses incurred in connection with the liquidation transaction as of june 27 2008 the deferred tax asset valuation allowance was 433 million approximately 22 million of this amount was related to deferred tax assets acquired in the maxtor acquisition for which the related benefit would have been credited to goodwill if realized the net increase in the valuation allowance in fiscal year 2008 was 34 million 

at july 3 2009 we had net deferred tax assets of 469 million the realization of 416 million of these deferred tax assets was primarily dependent on our ability to generate sufficient us and certain nonus taxable income in future periods although realization was not assured we believed that it was more likely than not that these deferred tax assets would be realized 

during fiscal year 2009 several enacted us tax law changes were taken into account in computing our income tax provision as follows on july 30 2008 the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 was enacted under this law we could elect to accelerate a portion of our unused amt and research tax credits in lieu of the 50percent bonus depreciation enacted in february 2008 on february 17 2009 the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 arra was enacted to extend the acceleration of amt and research credits in lieu of bonus depreciation based on qualified capital additions through the end of calendar year 2009 we concluded that we qualified for and recorded income tax benefits of approximately 17 million related to these accelerated credits on october 3 2008 the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 was signed into law under this law the research credit was retroactively extended through december 31 2009 from december 31 2007 this extension had no immediate impact on our tax provision due to valuation allowances that were recorded for the us deferred tax assets related to these additional credits 

as of july 3 2009 and june 27 2008 we had approximately 118 million and 374 million respectively in unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties the unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would impact the effective tax rate were 118 million and 68 million as of july 3 2009 and june 27 2008 respectively subject to certain future valuation allowance reversals as a result of the adoption of asc 805 business combinations in fiscal year 2010 the amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of july 3 2009 that would impact the effective tax rate was approximately 118 million 

it is our policy to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for taxes on the consolidated statements of operations during fiscal year 2009 we recognized a net benefit for interest and penalties of 6 million as compared to an expense of 3 million during fiscal year 2008 as of july 3 2009 we had 16 million of accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as compared to 22 million as of june 27 2008 

during fiscal year 2009 our unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties decreased by approximately 256 million primarily due to i reductions associated with audit activity of 6 million ii reductions associated with the expiration of certain statutes of limitation of 23 million iii reductions associated with the maxtor liquidation transactions of 232 million iv increases in current year unrecognized tax benefits of 13 million and v reductions from nonus exchange gains of 8 million approximately 21 million of reduction in unrecognized tax benefits during the period was recorded as a reduction to goodwill 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheet and cash flows contractual obligations and other commitments on our liquidity and capital resources 

cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and restricted cash and investments 



the increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily a result of cash provided by operating activities of 1932 million the issuance of the 2020 notes for an aggregate principal amount of 600 million and 86 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchases partially offset by the repayment of 350 million of our amended credit facility 77 million for the repayment of our 68 convertible senior notes due april 2010 the 68 notes capital expenditures of 639 million approximately 584 million to repurchase 324 million of our common shares and a 138 million net increase in shortterm investments 

our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase our shortterm investments consist primarily of readily marketable debt securities with remaining maturities of more than 90 days at the time of purchase as stated in our investment policy we are averse to principal loss and seek to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk we mitigate default risk by maintaining portfolio investments in diversified highquality investment grade securities with limited time to maturity we monitor our investment portfolio and position our portfolio to respond appropriately to a reduction in credit rating of any investment issuer guarantor or depository we intend to maintain a highly liquid portfolio by investing only in those marketable securities that we believe have active secondary or resale markets we believe our cash equivalents and shortterm investments are liquid and accessible we operate in some countries that may have restrictive regulations over the movement of cash andor foreign exchange across their borders these restrictions have not impeded our ability to conduct business in those countries nor do we expect them to in the next 12 months we are not aware of any downgrades losses or other significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or shortterm investments and accordingly we do not believe the fair value of our shortterm investments has significantly changed from the values reported as of july 2 2010 

the change in restricted cash and investments from the fiscal year ended july 3 2009 was primarily due to the repayment of our 300 million floating rate senior notes due 2009 at maturity and approximately 80 million of open market purchases of our 68 notes and 6375 senior notes due october 2011 the 2011 notes 

the following table summarizes results of statement of cash flows for the periods indicated

cash provided by used in financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities of 344 million for fiscal year 2010 was primarily attributable to the repayment of 350 million of our amended credit facility the repayment of our 300 million in aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes due october 2009 approximately 80 million of open market purchases of our 68 notes and 2011 notes the repayment and repurchase of the floating rate senior notes and the open market purchases were paid with approximately 379 million of restricted cash previously held in escrow we also paid 77 million in aggregate principal amount of our 68 notes and approximately 584 million to repurchase 324 million of our common shares which was partially offset by 587 million in net proceeds from the issuance of our 2020 notes and 86 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchases

from the issuance of our 10 notes paid to repurchase and retire our debt the remaining proceeds of 380 million from the issuance of our 10 notes were held in escrow for the repayment or repurchase of our debt 

in 2009 we adopted a policy of not paying a quarterly dividend 

net cash used in financing activities of approximately 15 billion for fiscal year 2008 was primarily attributable to the repurchases of our common shares totaling 15 billion additionally we paid approximately 216 million in dividends to our shareholders repaid 34 million of our longterm debt and received approximately 178 million in cash from employee stock option exercises and employee stock purchases 

liquidity sources cash requirements and commitments 

our primary sources of liquidity as of july 2 2010 consisted of approximately 25 billion in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments and cash we expect to generate from operations we also had 114 million in restricted cash and investments of which 76 million was related to our employee deferred compensation liabilities under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan 

our liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital research and development and capital expenditure needs and to service our debt our ability to fund these requirements and comply with the financial covenants under our debt agreements will depend on our future operations performance and cash flow and is subject to prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and financial business and other factors some of which are beyond our control we believe that our sources of cash will be sufficient to fund our operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months 

the carrying value of debt as of july 2 2010 and july 3 2009 was 2500 million and 2697 million respectively the table below presents the principal amounts of our outstanding debt in order of maturity 



on june 25 2010 we gave notice to the holders of our 2375 convertible senior notes due august 2012 the 2375 redemption notice and our 575 subordinated debentures due march 2012 the 575 debentures that we will call for redemption these notes as of july 3 2010 the share price condition for the 2375 notes was no longer satisfied and the conversion value did not exceed the principal value however the 2375 convertible senior notes due august 2012 the 2375 notes continue to be convertible in accordance with their terms as a result of the 2375 redemption notice included in the current portion of longterm debt on our consolidated balance sheet as of july 2 2010 were 298 million 326 million principal balance of our 2375 notes and 31 million 33 million principal balance of our 575 debentures subsequent to our fiscal year end we repaid approximately 

362 million to retire our 2375 notes and 575 debentures during fiscal year 2010 we terminated our credit facility having repaid the previously drawn 350 million earlier in the fiscal year in addition our 300 million floating rate senior notes were due and paid on october 1 2009 we also repurchased approximately 80 million of various debt issuances on the open market to reduce our outstanding debt obligations and repaid our 68 notes for 77 million at maturity 

on may 13 2010 we issued the 2020 notes for an aggregate principal amount of 600 million the 2020 notes were offered in a private placement exempt from the registration requirements of the securities act of 1933 as amended the 2020 notes were issued by seagate hdd cayman an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of seagate technologycayman and guaranteed by seagate technologycayman on a full and unconditional basis on july 3 2010 we became a guarantor under the 2020 notes we intend to use the proceeds from the debt issuance to redeem repay or repurchase existing debt and for general corporate purposes 

on january 27 2010 our board of directors authorized an antidilution share repurchase program which was publicly announced on february 1 2010 the repurchase program authorizes us to repurchase our ordinary shares to offset increases in diluted shares such as those caused by employee stock plans and convertible debt used in the determination of diluted net income per share the timing and number of shares to be repurchased by us will be dependent on general business and market conditions cash flows generated by future operations the price of our ordinary shares cash requirements for other investing and financing activities and maintaining compliance with our debt covenants repurchases may be made through open market or in privately negotiated transactions pursuant to rule 10b51 trading plans or other available means such as by way of an accelerated share repurchase program through block trades or through the purchase of call options or the sale of put options additionally there is no minimum or maximum number of shares to be repurchased under the program and the authority for the antidilution share repurchase program will continue until terminated by our board of directors 

during fiscal year 2010 we repurchased approximately 324 million of our common shares see item 5 market for registrants shares related shareholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities—repurchases of our equity securities 

for fiscal year 2011 we are targeting capital investment to be in the range of 68 of revenue we require substantial amounts of cash to fund scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness future capital expenditures and any increased working capital requirements we will continue to evaluate and manage the retirement and replacement of existing debt and associated obligations including the issuance of new debt securities exchanging existing debt securities for other debt securities and retiring debt pursuant to privately negotiated transactions open market purchases or otherwise in addition we may selectively pursue strategic alliances acquisitions and investments which may require additional capital 

contractual obligations and commitments 

our contractual cash obligations and commitments as of july 2 2010 have been summarized in the table below 



1 included in debt for fiscal year 2011 is the principal amount of 326 million related to our 2375 notes and the principal amount of 33 million related to our 575 debentures on june 25 2010 we issued a notice of redemption to the holders of the 2375 notes and the 575 debentures therefore the 2375 notes and 575 debentures have been reclassified as current portion of longterm debt on our consolidated balance sheet at july 2 2010 in addition under the terms of the 2375 indenture the notes were convertible up to the redemption date we redeemed the entire outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 2375 notes and 575 debentures in our first quarter of fiscal year 2011 2 includes total future minimum rent expense under noncancelable leases for both occupied and vacated facilities rent expense is shown net of sublease income 3 purchase obligations are defined as contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services which are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms 

as of july 2 2010 we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits and an accrual for the payment of related interest totaling 59 million none of which is expected to be paid within one year we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlement with a taxing authority will occur 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of july 2 2010 we did not have any material offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of regulation sk 

critical accounting policies 

the methods estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements the sec has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are highly uncertain at the time of estimation based on this definition our most critical policies include establishment of sales program accruals establishment of warranty accruals accounting for income taxes and the accounting for goodwill and other longlived assets below we discuss these policies further as well as the estimates and judgments involved we also have other accounting policies and accounting estimates relating to uncollectible customer accounts valuation of inventory valuation of sharebased payments and restructuring we believe that 

these other accounting policies and accounting estimates either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective or it is less likely that they would have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period 

establishment of sales program accruals we establish certain distributor and oem sales programs aimed at increasing customer demand for the distribution channel these programs typically involve rebates related to a distributors level of sales order size advertising or point of sale activity and price protection adjustments for oem sales rebates are typically based on an oem customers volume of purchases from seagate or other agreed upon rebate programs we provide for these obligations at the time that revenue is recorded based on estimated requirements we estimate these contrarevenue rebates and adjustments based on various factors including price reductions during the period reported estimated future price erosion customer orders distributor sellthrough and inventory levels program participation customer claim submittals and sales returns our estimates reflect contractual arrangements but also our judgment relating to variables such as customer claim rates and attainment of program goals and inventory and sellthrough levels reported by our distribution customers 

while we believe we have sufficient experience and knowledge of the market and customer buying patterns to reasonably estimate such rebates and adjustments actual market conditions or customer behavior could differ from our expectations as a result actual payments under these programs which may spread over several months after the related sale may vary from the amount accrued accordingly revenues and margins in the period in which the adjustment occurs may be affected for example if the pricing environment is more competitive than we anticipated accruals for forward price protection rebates may be inadequate in periods when pricing is less competitive accruals for forward price protection rebates may exceed actual payments in addition during periods in which our distributors inventories of our products are at higher than historical levels our contrarevenue estimates are subject to a greater degree of subjectivity and the potential for actual results to vary is accordingly higher currently our distributors inventories are at the low end of the historical range 

significant actual variations in any of the factors upon which we base our contrarevenue estimates could have a material effect on our operating results for fiscal years 2008 and 2009 total sales programs have ranged from 9 to 12 of gross revenues in fiscal year 2010 sales programs dropped to approximately 6 of gross revenue reflecting a more stable pricing environment resulting from industrywide supply constraints during the first half of fiscal year 2010 and a relatively balanced supply and demand environment during the march 2010 quarter adjustments to revenues due to under or over accruals for sales programs related to revenues reported in prior quarterly periods have averaged 04 of quarterly gross revenue for fiscal years 2008 through 2010 any future shifts in the industry supplydemand balance as well as other factors may result in a more competitive pricing environment and may cause sales programs as a percentage of gross revenue to increase from the current or historical levels if such rebates and incentives trend upwards revenues and margins will be reduced 

establishment of warranty accruals we estimate probable product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized we generally warrant our products for a period of one to five years our warranty provision considers estimated product failure rates and trends including the timing of product returns during the warranty periods estimated repair or replacement costs and estimated costs for customer compensatory claims related to product quality issues if any we use a statistical model to help with our estimates and we exercise considerable judgment in determining the underlying estimates should actual experience in any future period differ significantly from our estimates or should the rate of future product technological advancements fail to keep pace with the past our future results of operations could be materially affected our judgment is subject to a greater degree of subjectivity with respect to newly introduced products because of limited experience with those products upon which to base our warranty estimates 

the actual results with regard to warranty expenditures could have an adverse or favorable effect on our results of operations if the actual rate of unit failure the cost to repair a unit or the actual cost required to satisfy customer compensatory claims differ from those we used in determining the warranty accrual since we typically outsource our warranty repairs our repair cost is subject to periodic negotiations with vendors and may vary from our estimates we also exercise judgment in estimating our ability to sell certain repaired disk drives to the extent such sales fall below our forecast warranty cost will be adversely impacted 

we review our warranty accrual quarterly for products shipped in prior periods and which are still under warranty any changes in the estimates underlying the accrual may result in adjustments that impact the current period gross margins and income since fiscal year 2008 favorable or unfavorable changes in estimates of prior warranty accruals have approximated 05 or less of revenue our warranty cost was 22 and 24 of revenue during fiscal years 2008 and 2009 respectively changes in anticipated failure rates of specific products and significant changes in repair or replacement costs have historically been the major reasons for significant changes in prior estimates in fiscal year 2010 the cost of new warranties issued exclusive of the impact of any adjustment to prior warranty liabilities was close to the historical range and amounted to approximately 18 of revenue but total warranty cost decreased to 13 of revenue which is at the low end of the historical range the decrease in total warranty cost for fiscal year 2010 was due to a favorable adjustment to preexisting liabilities as a result of changing to a lower cost repair vendor other efforts to better leverage our warranty service infrastructure and lower product failure rates any future changes in failure rates of certain products as well as in repair or replacement costs may result in increased warranty accruals 

accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes pursuant to accounting standards codification asc topic 740 asc 740 income taxes previously statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes  in applying asc 740 we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits recognition of income and deductions and calculation of specific tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions the calculation of tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the internal revenue service or other tax jurisdictions if estimates of these tax liabilities are greater or less than actual results an additional tax benefit or provision will result the deferred tax assets we record each period depend primarily on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states and certain nonus jurisdictions each period we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and if necessary we adjust the valuation allowance so that net deferred tax assets are recorded only to the extent we conclude it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized if our outlook for future taxable income changes significantly our assessment of the need for a valuation allowance may also change 

as a result of improvements in the outlook for our future us taxable income we completed a reassessment of our valuation allowance against us deferred tax assets in the june 2010 quarter we decreased the valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets 

accounting for goodwill and other longlived assets we account for goodwill in accordance with asc 350 intangibles—goodwill and other previously sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  as required by asc 350 we test goodwill of our reporting units annually during our fourth quarter or whenever events occur or circumstances change such as an adverse change in business climate or a decline in the overall industry that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 

in accordance with asc 360054 impairment or disposal of longlived assets previously sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets  we test other longlived assets 

including property equipment and leasehold improvements and other intangible assets subject to amortization for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of those assets may not be recoverable we assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using the same approaches indicated above for asc 360 step two and compare it to its carrying value the excess of the carrying value over the fair value is allocated pro rata to derive the adjusted carrying value of each asset in the asset group the adjusted carrying value of each asset in the asset group is not reduced below its fair value 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 1 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our financial statements 

item 7a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 

we have exposure to market risks due to the volatility of interest rates foreign currency exchange rates equity and bond markets a portion of these risks are hedged but fluctuations could impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows additionally we have exposure to downgrades in the credit ratings of our counterparties as well as exposure related to our credit rating changes 

interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio at july 2 2010 with the exception of our auction rate securities we had no marketable securities that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for a period greater than 12 months and determined that no investments were otherthantemporarily impaired we currently do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 

we have fixed rate debt obligations we enter into debt obligations to support general corporate purposes including capital expenditures and working capital needs we currently do not use interest rate derivatives to hedge interest rate exposure on our outstanding debt 

the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio and debt obligations as of july 2 2010 all shortterm investments mature in three years or less included in shortterm debt for fiscal year 2011 is the principal amount of 326 million related to our 2375 notes and 33 million related to our 575 debentures on june 25 2010 we called for the redemption of the remaining notes for both the 2375 notes and the 575 debentures these notes were retired in the first quarter of fiscal year 2011 

fiscal years ended 



foreign currency exchange risk we may enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposure related to certain foreign currency commitments and anticipated foreign currency denominated expenditures our policy prohibits us from entering into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes during fiscal years 2010 and 2009 we did not enter into any hedges of net investments in foreign operations 

we also hedge a portion of our foreign currency denominated balance sheet positions with foreign currency forward exchange contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings will be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates the changes in fair value of these hedges are recognized in earnings in the same period as the gains and losses from the remeasurement of the assets and liabilities these foreign currency forward exchange contracts are not designated as hedging instruments under asc 815 derivatives and hedging previously sfas 161 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities  all these forward contracts mature within 12 months 

we evaluate hedging effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively and record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in other income expense on the consolidated statements of operations we did not have any net gains losses recognized in other income expense for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness during fiscal year 2010 nor did we discontinue any material cash flow hedges for a forecasted transaction in the same period 

the table below provides information as of july 2 2010 about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts the table is provided in us dollar equivalent amounts and presents the notional amounts at the contract exchange rates and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates 



1 equivalent to the unrealized net gain loss on existing contracts 

other market risks we have exposure to counterparty credit downgrades in the form of credit risk related to our accounts receivable balances our foreign currency forward exchange contracts and our fixed income portfolio we monitor and limit our credit exposure for both our accounts receivable balances and our foreign currency forward exchange contracts by performing ongoing credit evaluations we also manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with any one counterparty and we maintain limits on maximum tenor of contracts based on the credit rating of the financial institutions additionally the investment portfolio is diversified and structured to minimize credit risk as of july 2 2010 we had counterparty credit exposure of 7 million comprised of the marktomarket valuation related to our foreign currency forward exchange contracts in a gain position changes in our corporate issuer credit ratings have minimal impact on our financial results but downgrades may negatively impact our future transaction costs and our ability to execute transactions with various counterparties 

we have exposure to equity market risks due to changes in the fair value of the notional investments selected by our employees as part of our nonqualified deferred compensation plan—the seagate deferred compensation plan the sdcp in the quarter ended july 3 2009 we entered into a total return swap trs in order to manage the equity market risks associated with the sdcp plan liabilities we pay a floating rate based on libor plus a spread on the notional amount of the trs the trs is designed to substantially offset changes in the sdcp plan liability due to changes in the value of the investment options made by employees the contract term of the trs is one year and is settled on a monthly basis therefore limiting counterparty performance risk the terms of the trs required us to pledge initial collateral of 18 million to the counterparty for the term of the contract additional collateral may be posted contingent on the counterpartys exposure to the market value of the trs as of july 2 2010 we had 18 million pledged to the counterparty recorded as restricted cash 

during fiscal year 2010 approximately 1 million of our auction rate securities were called by the issuers as of july 2 2010 we continued to hold auction rate securities with a par value of approximately 19 million all of which are collateralized by student loans guaranteed by the federal family education loan program beginning in the march 2008 quarter these securities have continuously failed to settle at auction as of july 2 2010 the estimated fair value of these auction rate securities was 17 million we believe that the impairments totaling 2 million are temporary as we do not intend to sell these securities and have concluded it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the securities before the recovery of the amortized cost basis as such the impairment was recorded in other comprehensive income loss and these securities were classified as longterm investments

storage services an emerging area within the electronic data storage industry is services and solutions related to the backup archiving recovery and discovery of electronic data 

demand for electronic data storage 

the electronic data storage industry has traditionally been focused on compute applications we believe that technological advances in storage technology and a proliferation of noncompute applications in the consumer electronics ce market such as digital video recorders gaming devices digital music players and digital cameras are driving the broad global proliferation and growth of digital content through the 

• creation and sharing of all types of digital content including digital photos video movies and music by consumers and electronic data by enterprises • aggregation and distribution of digital content through services and other offerings by companies such as youtube by google inc google flickr by yahoo inc yahoo itunes by apple myspace by news corporation news corp and facebook • network infrastructure  including broadband cable and satellite that has enabled the access hosting and distribution of such digital content • enjoyment and consumption of digital content through dvrs handheld applications gaming consoles and in automobiles and • protection of digital content through storage on backup devices and storage services as a result of these factors the nature and amount of content being created requires increasingly higher storage capacity in order to store manage distribute utilize and back up such content this in turn has resulted in the rapid growth in demand for electronic data storage applications and solutions 

we believe that demand for electronic data storage in the enterprise and traditional compute markets continues to grow as the proliferation of digital content in the consumer space has resulted in additional demand for storage by enterprises including those that host aggregate distribute or share such content additionally increasing legal and regulatory requirements and changes in the nature and amount of data being stored has necessitated additional storage 

demand for disk drives 

the disk drive industry is sensitive to global macroeconomic conditions and has been impacted by the downturn in economic activity notwithstanding current economic conditions we believe that growth in digital content will continue to require increasingly higher storage capacity in order to store aggregate host distribute manage back up and use such content we believe this growth in digital content will result in increased demand for disk drive products 

historically the electronic data storage industry has introduced alternative technologies that directly compete with hard disk drives ssds using nand flash memory are a potential alternative to disk drives in certain applications such as consumer handheld devices and portable external storage we believe that in the foreseeable future the traditional compute markets that require high volume storage solutions as well as the data intensive noncompute markets will continue to be best served by hard disk drives based on the industrys ability to deliver reliable and cost effective mass storage devices 

disk drives for desktop computing the desktop computing market consists of disk drives used in traditional desktop and business critical applications we believe the demand for disk drives for desktop computing may be adversely impacted as consumers increasingly choose notebooks for their computing 

needs we believe that current growth opportunities for disk drives in traditional desktop computing applications lie primarily in developing markets where price remains a primary consideration 

higher capacity disk drives used in business critical applications are used to store less timecritical but capacityintensive data business critical electronic data which historically has been stored on tape or other backup and archival technologies are now being stored on high capacity disk drives because of decreases in cost per gigabyte 

disk drives for mobile computing the mobile compute market consists primarily of disk drives used in notebook systems notebook systems are increasingly becoming the preference over desktop computers for both consumers and enterprises as the need for mobility increases wireless adoption continues to advance and price and performance continue to improve 

ssds could become more competitive in the future in compute applications which require minimal storage capacity such as netbooks which are smaller less powerful less expensive forms of mobile computers and are slowly becoming a lowcost alternative to notebooks 

disk drives for enterprise storage we define enterprise storage as disk drives used in mission critical applications which are defined by the use of high performance high capacity disk drives in applications that are vital to the operation of enterprises we expect the market for mission critical enterprise storage solutions to be driven by enterprises continuing to move network traffic to dedicated storage area networks in addition as enterprises move away from the use of serverattached storage to networkattached storage and consolidate data centers to increase speed and reliability within a smaller space reduce network complexity and increase energy savings this will lead to an increased demand for more energy efficient smaller form factor disk drives these solutions are comprised principally of high performance enterprise class disk drives with sophisticated firmware and communications technologies 

ssd storage applications have been introduced as a potential alternative to redundant system startup or boot disk drives in addition enterprises are considering the use of ssds in applications where rapid processing is required the timing of significant adoption of ssds in these applications is currently unknown as enterprises weigh the cost benefits of mission critical enterprise disk drives relative to the perceived performance benefits of ssds 

disk drives for consumer electronics although flash memory solutions are contained in numerous consumer electronic devices disk drives in this market are primarily used in applications such as gaming and dvrs that require a higher capacity more costeffective storage solution we believe the demand for disk drives in ce will be driven by increased amounts of high definition content requiring larger amounts of storage capacity 

disk drives for branded solutions we define branded solutions as external disk drives sold in the retail channel disk drives used in branded solutions are for purposes such as personal backup portable data storage and to augment the consumers current desktop or notebook disk drive capacities we believe the proliferation of mediarich digital content will continue to create increasing consumer demand for external branded storage solutions our branded solutions disk drives are accounted for within our mobile and desktop compute markets 

disk drive technology 

overview 

the design and manufacturing of disk drives depends on highly advanced technology and manufacturing techniques and therefore requires high levels of research and development spending and capital equipment investments manufacturing our disk drives is a complex process that begins with the production of individual components and ends with a fully assembled unit we design fabricate and assemble a number of the most important components found in our disk drives including readwrite heads 

and recording media our design and manufacturing operations are based on technology platforms that are used to produce various disk drive products that serve multiple data storage applications and markets our core technology platforms are focused around the areal density of media and readwrite head technologies using an integrated platform design and manufacturing leverage approach allows us to deliver a portfolio of disk drive products to service a wide range of electronic data storage applications and a wide range of industries 

disk drive performance 

disk drive performance is commonly differentiated by six key characteristics 

• storage capacity commonly expressed in gigabytes gb or terabytes tb which is the amount of data that can be stored on the disk • spindle rotation speed commonly expressed in revolutions per minute rpm which has an effect on speed of access to data • interface transfer rate commonly expressed in megabytes per second which is the rate at which data moves between the disk drive and the computer controller • average seek time commonly expressed in milliseconds which is the time needed to position the heads over a selected track on the disk surface • data transfer rate commonly expressed in megabytes per second which is the rate at which data is transferred to and from the disk and • product quality and reliability commonly expressed in annualized return rates arr areal density 

areal density is a measure of storage capacity per square inch on the recording surface of a disk the capacity of a disk drive is determined by the number of disks it contains as well as the areal density capability of these disks we expect the longterm demand for increased disk drive capacities will continue to grow proportionately with the shift in storage applications from predominantly compute applications to more mediarich content in particular audio video and photo storage data continue to increase in size with high definition video content being an example of data requiring many multiples of the storage capacity of standard video we believe that demand will further intensify by the proliferation of these forms of content we have been pursuing and will continue to pursue a number of technologies to increase areal densities across the entire range of our products for expanding disk drive capacities and reducing the number of disks and heads per drive to further reduce product costs in addition we continue to invest in next generation storage technologies like solid state 

manufacturing 

disk drive manufacturers are distinguished by their level of vertical integration which is the degree to which they control the design and manufacture of the technology used in their products and by whether they are captive producing disk drives for their own computer systems or independent producing disk drives as a standalone product 

vertically integrated hard drive manufacturers design and produce their own readwrite heads and recording media which are critical technologies for disk drives this integrated approach enables manufacturers to lower costs and to improve the functionality of components so that they work together efficiently in contrast manufacturers that are not integrated purchase most of their components from thirdparty suppliers upon whom they depend for key elements of their technological innovation and differentiation this can limit their ability to coordinate technology roadmaps and optimize the component design process for manufacturing efficiency and product reliability while making them reliant on the 

technology investment decisions of their suppliers independent manufacturers can enjoy a competitive advantage over captive manufacturers in working with oems because they do not compete with oems for computer system sales we believe the competitive dynamics of the disk drive industry favor integrated independent manufacturers with the scale to make substantial technology investments and apply them across a broad product portfolio and set of customers 

we pursue a vertically integrated business strategy based on the ownership of critical component technologies allowing us to maintain control over our product roadmap and component cost quality and availability we believe that because of our vertical design and manufacturing strategy we are well suited to meet the challenges posed by the close interdependence of components for disk drives our manufacturing efficiency and flexibility are critical elements of our integrated business strategy we continuously seek to improve our manufacturing efficiency and cost by 

• employing manufacturing automation to enhance our efficiency • improving product quality and reliability and reducing costs • integrating our supply chain with suppliers and customers to enhance our demand visibility and reduce our working capital requirements • coordinating between our manufacturing group and our research and development organization to rapidly achieve volume manufacturing and • rationalizing the facilities we operate and reducing the number of personnel we employ however a vertically integrated model tends to have less flexibility when there is a constraint in demand which then exposes us to higher unit costs 

due to the significant challenges posed by the need to continually innovate and improve manufacturing efficiency and the required investments in capital equipment and research and development the disk drive industry has undergone significant consolidation as disk drive manufacturers and component manufacturers have merged with other companies or exited the industry the global macroeconomic environment as well as the increasing technological challenges associated levels of investment and competitive necessity of largescale operations may continue to drive future industry consolidation additionally we may in the future face indirect competition from customers who from time to time evaluate whether to offer electronic data storage products that may compete with our products 

components and raw materials 

all of our disk drive products incorporate certain components including a head disk assembly and a printed circuit board mounted to the head disk assembly which are sealed inside a rigid base and top cover containing the recording components in a contamination controlled environment 

readwrite heads the function of the readwrite head is to scan across the disk as it spins magnetically recording or reading information the tolerances of recording heads are extremely demanding and require stateoftheart equipment and processes we maintain a highly integrated approach to our business by designing and manufacturing a significant portion of the components we view as critical to our products such as recording heads and media our readwrite heads are manufactured with thinfilm and photolithographic processes similar to those used to produce semiconductor integrated circuits though challenges in magnetic film properties and topographical structures are unique to the disk drive industry we perform all primary stages of design and manufacture of readwrite heads at our facilities from time to time we use third party readwrite heads for use in our products 

media the extent of our use of externally sourced finished media and aluminum substrates varies based on product mix technology and our internal capacity levels we purchase all of our glass substrates from third parties which we use in the disk drives we make for mobile and small form factor ce products 

printed circuit boards the printed circuit board assemblies pcbas are comprised of standard and custom asics and ancillary electronic control chips the asics control the movement of data to and from the readwrite heads and through the internal controller and interface which communicates with the host computer the asics and control chips form electronic circuitry that delivers instructions to a head positioning mechanism called an actuator to guide the heads to the selected track of a disk where the data is recorded or retrieved disk drive manufacturers use one or more industry standard interfaces such as serial advanced technology architecture sata small computer system interface scsi serial attached scsi sas or fibre channel fc to communicate to the host systems we outsource to third parties the manufacture and assembly of the pcbas used in our disk drives we do not manufacture any asics but we participate in their proprietary design 

head disk assembly the head disk assembly consists of one or more disks attached to a spindle assembly powered by a spindle motor that rotates the disks at a high constant speed around a hub the disks or recording media are the components on which data is stored and from which it is retrieved each disk consists of a substrate of finely machined aluminum or glass deposited with layers of thinfilm magnetic material readwrite heads mounted on an arm assembly similar in concept to that of a record player fly extremely close to each disk surface and record data on and retrieve it from concentric tracks in the magnetic layers of the rotating disks the readwrite heads are mounted vertically on an eshaped assembly which is actuated by a voicecoil motor to allow the heads to move from track to track the eblock and the recording media are mounted inside the head disk assembly we purchase spindle motors from outside vendors and from time to time participate in the design of the motors that go into our products 

disk drive assembly following the completion of the head disk assembly it is mated to the pcba and the completed unit goes through extensive defect mapping and testing prior to packaging and shipment disk drive assembly and test operations occur primarily at facilities located in china singapore and thailand we perform subassembly and component manufacturing operations at our facilities in china malaysia northern ireland singapore thailand and in the united states in minnesota in addition third parties manufacture and assemble components for us in various asian countries including china japan korea malaysia the philippines singapore taiwan thailand and vietnam in europe and the united states 

suppliers of components and capital equipment due to industry consolidation there are a limited number of independent suppliers of components such as recording heads and media available to disk drive manufacturers vertically integrated disk drive manufacturers who manufacture their own components are less dependent on external component suppliers than less vertically integrated disk drive manufacturers 

generally we believe that there is more than adequate supply of components to meet currently identified industry demand however we believe that the supply of glass substrates a component in mobile disk drives may be below adequate levels to support demand for mobile drives this supply constraint may be particularly pronounced if global macroeconomic conditions improve in the near term or if the shift in demand from desktop compute to mobile compute accelerates 

drive manufacturers have adjusted their capital spending plans in reaction to the reduction in demand as a result capital equipment manufacturers may be increasingly financially constrained and therefore may be less able to supply equipment when needed 

commodity and other manufacturing costs the production of disk drives requires precious metals scarce alloys and industrial commodities that are subject to fluctuations in prices and the supply of which has at times been constrained in order to mitigate susceptibility to these conditions we may maintain increased inventory of precious metals scarce alloys and industrial commodities we believe that currently there is adequate supply of these precious metals scarce alloys and industrial commodities additionally 

volatility in fuel costs may increase our costs related to commodities manufacturing and freight therefore we may increase our use of ocean shipments to help offset any increase in freight costs 

industry supply balance from time to time the industry has experienced periods of imbalances between supply and demand to the extent that the disk drive industry builds capacity based on expectations of demand that do not materialize price erosion may become more pronounced conversely during periods where demand exceeds supply price erosion is generally more benign

customers 

we sell our disk drives primarily to major original equipment manufacturers oems we also sell to distributors and retailers under our globally recognized brand names we have longstanding relationships with many of our oem customers including hp dell emc international business machines corporation ibm and lenovo 

the following table summarizes our disk drive revenue by channel and by geography 



oem customers typically enter into master purchase agreements with us these agreements provide for pricing volume discounts order lead times product support obligations and other terms and conditions the term of these agreements is usually 6 to 24 months however they are generally cancelable for convenience by either party upon written notice our product support obligations generally extend substantially beyond the term of the agreement these master agreements typically do not commit the 

customer to buy any minimum quantity of products or create exclusive relationships deliveries are scheduled only after receipt of purchase orders in addition with limited leadtime customers may cancel or defer most purchase orders without significant penalty anticipated orders from many of our customers have in the past failed to materialize or oem delivery schedules have been deferred or altered as a result of changes in their business needs 

our distributors generally enter into nonexclusive agreements for the resale of our products they typically furnish us with a nonbinding indication of their nearterm requirements and product deliveries are generally scheduled accordingly the agreements and related sales programs typically provide the distributors with limited right of return and price protection rights in addition we offer sales programs to distributors on a quarterly and periodic basis to promote the sale of selected products in the sales channel 

our branded storage product is sold to retailers either by us directly or by our distributors retail sales made by us or our distributors typically require greater marketing support sales incentives and price protection periods we have increased our sales and market penetration of branded storage products to retail customers over the last two years further expanding our retail customer base 

we also regularly enter into agreements with our customers which obligate us to provide a limited indemnity against losses resulting from intellectual property claims these agreements are customary in our industry and typically require us to indemnify our customers against certain damages and costs incurred as a result of third party intellectual property claims arising as a result of their use of our products 

the only customer exceeding 10 of our disk drive revenue for all of fiscal years 2007 through 2009 was hp accounting for approximately 16 of our disk drive revenue in each year dell exceeded 10 of our disk drive revenue in fiscal years 2009 and 2008 sales to dell accounted for approximately 11 11 and 9 of our disk drive revenue in fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively we have master purchase agreements in place with hp and dell that are cancelable for convenience by either party upon written notice and do not require either customer to purchase any minimum or other specified quantity of our products no other customer accounted for 10 or more of our disk drive revenue in fiscal years 2009 2008 or 2007 see item 1a risk factors—risks related to our business—dependence on key customers—we may be adversely affected by the loss of or reduced delayed or cancelled purchases by one or more of our larger customers

foreign sales are subject to foreign exchange controls and other restrictions including in the case of some countries approval by the office of export administration of the us department of commerce and other us governmental agencies 

competition 

the markets that we compete in are intensely competitive disk drive manufacturers not only compete for a limited number of major disk drive customers but also compete with other companies in the electronic data storage industry that provide alternative storage solutions such as flash memory tape optical and ssds some of the principal factors used by customers to differentiate among electronic data storage solutions manufacturers are storage capacity price per unit and price per gigabyte storageretrieval access times data transfer rates product quality and reliability supply continuity form factor warranty and brand we believe that our disk drive products are competitive with respect to each of these factors in the markets that we currently address 

we summarize below our principal disk drive competitors other competitors the effect of competition on price erosion for our products and product life cycles and technology 

principal disk drive competitors we have experienced and expect to continue to experience intense competition from a number of domestic and foreign companies some of which have greater financial and other resources than we have these competitors include independent disk drive manufacturers such as western digital as well as large captive manufacturers such as fujitsu hitachi samsung and toshiba because these captive manufacturers produce complete computer systems and other noncompute consumer electronics and mobile devices they can derive a greater portion of their operating margins from other components which may reduce their need to realize a profit on the disk drives included in their computer systems and may allow them to sell disk drives to third parties at very low margins many captive manufacturers are also formidable competitors because they have more resources and greater access to their internal customers than we do in addition competitors such as samsung and toshiba are increasingly integrating other storage technologies such as flash memory hybrid disk drives and ssds into their product offerings not only may they be willing to sell their disk drives at a lower margin to advance their overall business strategy their portfolio may allow them to be indifferent to which technology prevails over the other as they can offer a broad range of storage media and solutions and focus on those with lowest costs and greatest sales in connection with our branded storage products in addition to competing with our disk drive competitors we also compete with companies such as iomega corporation an emc company and lacie sa that purchase disk drives from us and our competitors for use in their branded storage products 

other competitors we also are experiencing competition from companies that provide alternative storage technologies such as flash memory and ssds in the flash memory market primarily used in lower capacity handheld devices the principal competitors include micron technology inc micron samsung sandisk and toshiba in enterprise applications where ssds are used for rapid processing and high volume transactions our principal competitors include hitachi and stec 

price erosion 

our industry has been characterized by price declines for disk drive products with comparable capacity performance and feature sets likeforlike products price declines for likeforlike products price erosion are more pronounced during periods of 

• economic contraction or industry consolidation in which competitors may use discounted pricing to attempt to maintain or gain market share • few new product introductions when multiple competitors have comparable or alternative product offerings • temporary imbalances between industry supply and demand and • seasonally weaker demand which may cause excess supply disk drive manufacturers typically attempt to offset price erosion with an improved mix of disk drive products characterized by higher capacity better performance and additional feature sets andor product cost reductions 

we expect price erosion in our industry will continue to remain competitive we believe it is necessary for industry participants to continue to introduce new product offerings that utilize advanced technologies ahead of the competition in order to take advantage of potentially higher initial profit margins and reduced cost structures on these new products 

product life cycles and changing technology our industry has been characterized by significant advances in technology which have contributed to rapid product life cycles as a result success in our industry has been dependent to a large extent on the ability to be the firsttomarket with new products allowing those disk drive manufacturers who introduce new products first to sell those products at a premium until comparable products are introduced also because our industry is characterized by continuous price erosion the existence of rapid product life cycles has necessitated the need to quickly achieve product cost effectiveness changing technology also necessitates the need for ongoing investments in research and development which may be difficult to recover due to rapid product life cycles and economic declines further there is a continued need to successfully execute product transitions and new product introductions as factors such as quality reliability and manufacturing yields become of increasing competitive importance 

seasonality 

the disk drive industry traditionally experiences seasonal variability in demand with higher levels of demand in the second half of the calendar year this seasonality is driven by consumer spending in the backtoschool season from late summer to fall and the traditional holiday shopping season from fall to winter in addition corporate demand is typically higher during the second half of the calendar year 

research and development 

we are committed to developing new component technologies products and alternative storage technologies including solid state technology our research and development focus is designed to bring new products to market in high volume with quality attributes that our customers expect before our competitors part of our product development strategy is to leverage a design platform andor subsystem within product families to serve different market needs this platform strategy allows for more efficient resource utilization leverages best design practices reduces exposure to changes in demand and allows for achievement of lower costs through purchasing economies our advanced technology integration effort focuses disk drive and component research on recording subsystems including readwrite heads and recording media marketspecific product technology as well as technology focused towards new business opportunities the primary purpose of our advanced technology integration effort is to ensure timely 

availability of mature component technologies to our product development teams as well as allowing us to leverage and coordinate those technologies in the design centers across our products in order to take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace during fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 we had product development expenses of approximately 953 million 1028 million and 904 million respectively which represented 10 8 and 8 of our consolidated revenue respectively 

patents and licenses 

as of july 3 2009 we had approximately 4035 us patents and 660 patents issued in various foreign jurisdictions as well as approximately 1265 us and 532 foreign patent applications pending the number of patents and patent applications will vary at any given time as part of our ongoing patent portfolio management activity due to the rapid technological change that characterizes the electronic data storage industry we believe that the improvement of existing products reliance upon trade secret law protection of unpatented proprietary knowhow and development of new products are also important to our business in addition to patent protection in establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage accordingly we intend to continue our efforts to protect broadly our intellectual property including obtaining patents where available in connection with our research and development program 

the electronic data storage industry is characterized by significant litigation relating to patent and other intellectual property rights because of rapid technological development in the electronic data storage industry some of our products have been and in the future could be alleged to infringe existing patents of third parties from time to time we receive claims that our products infringe patents of third parties although we have been able to resolve some of those claims or potential claims by obtaining licenses or rights under the patents in question without a material adverse affect on us other claims have resulted in adverse decisions or settlements in addition other claims are pending which if resolved unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations for more information on these claims see item 8 note 13 legal environmental and other contingencies the costs of engaging in intellectual property litigation in the past have been and may be substantial irrespective of the merits of the claim or the outcome we have patent licenses with a number of companies additionally as part of our normal intellectual property practices we may be engaged in negotiations with other major electronic data storage companies and component manufacturers with respect to licenses 

backlog 

in view of our customers rights to cancel or defer orders with little or no penalty we believe backlog in the disk drive industry is of limited indicative value in estimating future performance and results 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to us and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites some of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution and these permits are subject to modification renewal and revocation by issuing authorities 

we have established environmental management systems and continually update our environmental policies and standard operating procedures for our operations worldwide we believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws regulations and permits we budget for operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental laws if additional or more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future we could incur additional operating costs and capital expenditures 

some environmental laws such as the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended the superfund law and its state equivalents can impose liability for the cost of cleanup of contaminated sites upon any of the current or former site owners or operators or upon parties who sent waste to these sites regardless of whether the owner or operator owned the site at the time of the release of hazardous substances or the lawfulness of the original disposal activity we were identified as a potentially responsible party at several superfund sites at each of these sites we have an assigned portion of the financial liability based on the type and amount of hazardous substances disposed of by each party at the site and the number of financially viable parties we have fulfilled our responsibilities at some of these sites and remain involved in only a few at this time 

while our ultimate costs in connection with these sites is difficult to predict with complete accuracy based on our current estimates of cleanup costs and our expected allocation of these costs we do not expect costs in connection with these superfund sites and contaminated sites to be material 

we may be subject to various state federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment including those restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products for example the european union eu enacted the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment rohs which prohibits the use of certain substances including lead in certain products including disk drives put on the market after july 1 2006 as well as the waste electrical and electronic equipment weee directive which makes producers of electrical goods including disk drives financially responsible for specified collection recycling treatment and disposal of past and future covered products similar legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions including in the united states canada mexico china and japan 

if we or our suppliers fail to comply with the substance restrictions recycle requirements or other environmental requirements as they are enacted worldwide it could have a materially adverse effect on our business 

employees 

at july 3 2009 we employed approximately 47000 employees temporary employees and contractors worldwide of which approximately 38650 employees were located in our asian operations we believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees at all levels we believe that our employee relations are good

 item 1a risk factors 

risks related to our business 

current macroeconomic conditions—the recent downturn in the macroeconomic environment has and may continue to negatively impact our results of operations 

the disruption in global macroeconomic conditions has had a significant impact on the disk drive industry as a whole and the results of our operations due to the uncertainty about current macroeconomic conditions we believe our customers have postponed and may continue to postpone spending in response to tighter credit increasing level of unemployment negative financial news andor declines in income or asset values which could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products other factors that could influence demand include conditions in the residential real estate and mortgage markets labor and healthcare costs access to credit consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior these and other economic factors could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and on our financial condition and operating results 

in addition the capital and credit markets continue to experience some measure of volatility and disruption resulting in a tightening in the credit markets a low level of liquidity in many financial markets and reduces stability in fixed income credit currency and equity markets there could be a number of followon effects from the credit crisis on our business including the insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays and the inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products 

competition—our industry is highly competitive and our products have experienced and will continue to experience significant price erosion and market share variability 

the disk drive industry is intensely competitive and vendors typically experience substantial price erosion over the life of a product our competitors have historically offered existing products at lower prices as part of a strategy to gain or retain market share and customers and we expect these practices to continue we will need to continually reduce our prices to retain our market share which could adversely affect our results of operations 

the pricing environment in the june 2009 quarter moderated with price erosion returning to historical rates however we believe price erosion and market share variability will continue as our competitors engage in aggressive pricing actions targeted to shift customer demand to offset lower demand due to the deterioration in business and economic conditions 

our ability to offset the effect of price erosion through new product introductions at higher average prices is diminished to the extent competitors introduce products into particular markets ahead of our similar competing products this risk is particularly pronounced in markets where we have recently experienced lower market share as is the case in the market for 25inch ata products our ability to offset the effect of price erosion is also diminished during times when product life cycles for particular products are extended allowing competitors more time to enter the market 

the growth of sales to distributors that serve producers of nonbranded products in the personal storage sector may also contribute to increased price erosion these customers generally have limited product qualification programs which increases the number of competing products available to satisfy their demand as a result purchasing decisions for these customers are based largely on price and terms any increase in our average price erosion would have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

additionally a significant portion of our success in the past has been a result of increasing our market share at the expense of our competitors particularly in small form factor enterprise markets market share for our products can be negatively affected by our customers diversifying their sources of supply as our competitors enter the market for particular products as well as by our ability to ramp volume production of new product offerings when our competitors successfully introduce product offerings that are 

competitive with our recently introduced products our customers may quickly diversify their sources of supply any significant decline in our market share in any of our principal market applications would adversely affect our results of operations 

principal competitors—we compete with both independent manufacturers whose primary focus is producing technologically advanced disk drives and captive manufacturers who do not depend solely on sales of disk drives to maintain their profitability 

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience intense competition from a number of domestic and foreign companies including other independent disk drive manufacturers and large captive manufacturers the term independent in this context refers to manufacturers that primarily produce disk drives as a standalone product such as western digital corporation and the term captive in this context refers to manufacturers who themselves or through affiliated entities produce complete computer or other systems that contain disk drives or other electronic data storage products such as fujitsu limited hitachi global storage technologies samsung electronics incorporated and toshiba corporation 

captive manufacturers are formidable competitors because they have the ability to determine pricing for complete systems without regard to the margins on individual components as components other than disk drives generally contribute a greater portion of the operating margin on a complete computer system than do disk drives captive manufacturers do not necessarily need to realize a profit on the disk drives included in a complete computer system and as a result may be willing to sell disk drives to third parties at very low margins captive manufacturers are also formidable competitors because they have more substantial resources than we do samsung and hitachi together with affiliated entities also sell other products to our customers including critical components like flash memory asics and flat panel displays and may be willing to sell their disk drives at a lower margin to advance their overall business strategy one of our captive manufacturer competitors toshiba corporation recently announced that it will buy fujitsu limiteds hard disk drive business in order to increase market share cut costs and improve their ability to compete in the market to the extent we are not successful competing with captive or independent disk drive manufacturers our results of operations will be adversely affected 

in response to customer demand for highquality highvolume and lowcost disk drives manufacturers of disk drives have had to develop large and in some cases global production facilities with highly developed technological capabilities and internal controls the development of these large production facilities combined with industry consolidation can further increase the intensity of competition 

we also face indirect competition from present and potential customers who evaluate from time to time whether to manufacture their own disk drives or other electronic data storage products 

we also experience competition from other companies that produce alternative storage technologies like flash memory where increasing capacity decreasing cost lower power consumption and improvements in performance ruggedness have resulted in competition with our lower capacity smaller form factor disk drives while this competition has traditionally been in the markets for handheld consumer electronics applications these competitors have recently announced solid state drives ssds for notebook and enterprise compute applications some of these companies like samsung also sell disk drives certain customers for both notebook and enterprise compute applications are evaluating and adopting ssds as alternatives to hard drives in certain applications 

volatility of quarterly results—our quarterly results of operations fluctuate sometimes significantly from period to period and may cause our share price to decline 

in the past our quarterly revenue and results of operations have fluctuated sometimes significantly from period to period these fluctuations which we expect to continue may be occasioned by a variety of factors including 

• current uncertainty in global economic conditions may pose a risk to the overall economy as consumers and businesses may defer purchases in response to the global recession negative financial news and the continuing instability of several large financial institutions • adverse changes in the level of economic activity in the united states and other major regions in which we do business as economic activity continued to deteriorate during fiscal year 2009 • competitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices by our competitors targeted to encourage shifting of customer demand • delays or problems in our introduction of new products particularly new disk drives with lower cost structures the inability to achieve high production yields or delays in customer qualification or initial product quality issues • changes in purchasing patterns by our distributor customers • increased costs or adverse changes in availability of supplies of raw materials or components especially in light of recent consolidation among component suppliers building inflationary pressure and the relative volatility of the us dollar as compared to other currencies • the impact of corporate restructuring activities that we have and may continue to engage in • changes in the demand for the computer systems storage subsystems and consumer electronics that contain our disk drives due to seasonality economic conditions and other factors • changes in purchases from period to period by our primary customers particularly as our competitors are able to introduce and produce in volume competing disk drive solutions or alternative storage technology solutions such as flash memory or ssds • shifting trends in customer demand which when combined with overproduction of particular products particularly when the industry is served by multiple suppliers results in supplydemand imbalances • our high proportion of fixed costs including research and development expenses and • announcements of new products services or technological innovations by us or our competitors as a result we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our revenue and results of operations may not be meaningful and that these comparisons may not be an accurate indicator of our future performance our results of operations in one or more future quarters may fail to meet the expectations of investment research analysts or investors which could cause an immediate and significant decline in the trading price of our common shares 

new product offerings—market acceptance of new product introductions cannot be accurately predicted and our results of operations will suffer if there is less demand for our new products than is anticipated 

we are continually developing new products with the goal that we will be able to introduce technologically advanced and lower cost disk drives into the marketplace ahead of our competitors 

the success of our new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors including market acceptance our ability to manage the risks associated with product transitions the effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand and the risk that our new products will have 

quality problems or other defects in the early stages of introduction that were not anticipated in the design of those products accordingly we cannot accurately determine the ultimate effect that our new products will have on our results of operations 

in addition the success of our new product introductions is dependent upon our ability to qualify as a primary source of supply with our oem customers in order for our products to be considered by our customers for qualification we must be among the leaders in timetomarket with those new products once a product is accepted for qualification testing any failure or delay in the qualification process or a requirement that we requalify can result in our losing sales to that customer until new products are introduced the limited number of highvolume oems magnifies the effect of missing a product qualification opportunity these risks are further magnified because we expect competitive pressures to result in declining sales eroding prices and declining gross margins on our current generation products we cannot assure that we will be among the leaders in timetomarket with new products or that we will be able to successfully qualify new products with our customers in the future if we cannot successfully deliver competitive products our future results of operations may be adversely affected 

smaller form factor disk drives—if we do not continue to successfully market smaller form factor disk drives our business may suffer 

the disk drive industry is experiencing significant increases in sales of smaller form factor disk drives for an expanding number of applications in particular notebook computers and consumer electronic devices but also in personal computers and enterprise storage applications our future success will depend on our ability to develop and introduce smaller form factor drives at desired price and capacity points faster than our competitors 

we have experienced competition from other companies that produce alternative storage technologies like solid state or flash memory where increased capacity improving cost lower power consumption and performance ruggedness have resulted in flash memory largely replacing disk drives in handheld applications we believe that the demand for disk drives to store or back up related media content from such handheld devices however continues to grow while this competition has traditionally been limited to the markets for handheld consumer electronics applications these competitors have announced ssds for netbook notebook and enterprise compute applications 

if we do not suitably adapt our product offerings to successfully introduce additional smaller form factor disk drives or alternative storage products based on flash storage technology or if our competitors are successful in achieving customer acceptance of ssd products for netbook notebook and enterprise compute applications then our customers may decrease the amounts of our products that they purchase which would adversely affect our results of operations 

seasonality—because we experience seasonality in the sales of our products our results of operations will generally be adversely impacted during the second half of our fiscal year 

sales of computer systems storage subsystems and consumer electronics tend to be seasonal and therefore we expect to continue to experience seasonality in our business as we respond to variations in our customers demand for disk drives in particular we anticipate that sales of our products will continue to be lower during the second half of our fiscal year in the mobile compute desktop compute and consumer electronics market applications of our business this seasonality is partially attributable to the historical trend in our results derived from our customers increased sales of personal computers laptop computers and consumer electronics during the backtoschool and winter holiday season in the enterprise market our sales are seasonal because of the capital budgeting and purchasing cycles of our end users since our working capital needs peak during periods in which we are increasing production in anticipation of orders that have not yet been received our results of operations will fluctuate seasonally even if the forecasted demand for our products proves accurate furthermore it is difficult for us to evaluate the degree to which 

this seasonality may affect our business in future periods because of the rate and unpredictability of product transitions and new product introductions particularly in the consumer electronics market as well as macroeconomic conditions 

difficulty in predicting quarterly demand—if we fail to predict demand accurately for our products in any quarter we may not be able to recapture the cost of our investments 

the disk drive industry operates on quarterly purchasing cycles with much of the order flow in any given quarter typically coming at the end of that quarter our manufacturing process requires us to make significant productspecific investments in inventory in each quarter for that quarters production since we typically receive the bulk of our orders late in a quarter after we have made our investments there is a risk that our orders will not be sufficient to allow us to recapture the costs of our investment before the products resulting from that investment have become obsolete we cannot assure you that we will be able to accurately predict demand in the future 

another factor that may negatively affect our ability to recapture costs of investments in future quarters is the recent decline in global macroeconomic conditions the decline in economic and political conditions in many of our markets has had and may continue to have an effect on demand for our products and render budgeting and forecasting difficult the difficulty in forecasting demand increases the difficulty in anticipating our inventory requirements which may cause us to overproduce finished goods resulting in inventory writeoffs or underproduce finished goods affecting our ability to meet customer requirements additionally the risk of inventory writeoffs could increase if we were to continue to hold higher inventory levels we cannot be certain that we will be able to recover the costs associated with increased inventory 

other factors that may negatively impact our ability to recapture the cost of investments in any given quarter include 

• the impact of variable demand and an aggressive pricing environment for disk drives • the impact of competitive product announcements and possible excess industry supply both with respect to particular disk drive products and with respect to competing alternative storage technology solutions such as ssds in notebook and enterprise compute applications • our inability to reduce our fixed costs to match sales in any quarter because of our vertical manufacturing strategy which means that we make more capital investments than we would if we were not vertically integrated • dependence on our ability to successfully qualify manufacture and sell in increasing volumes on a costeffective basis and with acceptable quality our disk drive products particularly the new disk drive products with lower cost structures • variations in the cost of components for our products especially during periods when the us dollar is relatively volatile as compared to other currencies • uncertainty in the amount of purchases from our distributor customers who from time to time constitute a large portion of our total sales • our product mix and the related margins of the various products • accelerated reduction in the price of our disk drives due to technological advances andor an oversupply of disk drives in the market a condition that is exacerbated when the industry is served by multiple suppliers and shifting trends in demand which can create supply and demand imbalances • manufacturing delays or interruptions particularly at our manufacturing facilities in china malaysia northern ireland singapore thailand or the united states 23 

• limited access to components that we obtain from a single or a limited number of suppliers • the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the cost of producing our products and the effective price of our products to foreign consumers and • operational issues arising out of the increasingly automated nature of our manufacturing processes dependence on supply of components equipment and raw materials—if we experience shortages or delays in the receipt of critical components equipment or raw materials necessary to manufacture our products we may suffer lower operating margins production delays and other material adverse effects 

the cost quality and availability of components certain equipment and raw materials used to manufacture disk drives and key components like recording media and heads are critical to our success the equipment we use to manufacture our products and components is frequently custom made and comes from a few suppliers and the lead times required to obtain manufacturing equipment can be significant particularly important components for disk drives include readwrite heads aluminum or glass substrates for recording media asics spindle motors printed circuit boards and suspension assemblies we rely on sole suppliers or a limited number of suppliers for some of these components including media aluminum and glass substrates that we do not manufacture recording media and heads asics spindle motors printed circuit boards and suspension assemblies if our vendors for these components are unable to meet our requirements we could experience a shortage in supply which would adversely affect our results of operations 

in addition the recent increases in demand for small form factor mobile products have led to shortages in glass substrates a component used in smaller form factor disk drives to make the recording media for such drives if our vendors for glass substrates are unable to meet our demand or are unable to invest sufficient capital to expand capacity to meet the industrys increasing unit growth in small form factor mobile disk drives we could experience a shortage in the supply of this critical component which could limit our ability to meet our customers demand for small form disk drives 

in the past we have experienced increased costs and production delays when we were unable to obtain the necessary equipment or sufficient quantities of some components andor have been forced to pay higher prices or make volume purchase commitments or advance deposits for some components equipment or raw materials that were in short supply in the industry in general 

consolidation among component manufacturers may result in some component manufacturers exiting the industry or not making sufficient investments in research to develop new components 

if there is a shortage of or delay in supplying us with critical components equipment or raw materials then 

• it is likely that our suppliers would raise their prices and if we could not pass these price increases to our customers our operating margin would decline • we might have to reengineer some products which would likely cause production and shipment delays make the reengineered products more costly and provide us with a lower rate of return on these products • we would likely have to allocate the components we receive to certain of our products and ship less of others which could reduce our revenues and could cause us to lose sales to customers who could purchase more of their required products from manufacturers that either did not experience these shortages or delays or that made different allocations and • we might be late in shipping products causing potential customers to make purchases from our competitors thus causing our revenue and operating margin to decline 24 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain critical components in a timely and economic manner 

importance of timetomarket—our results of operations may depend on our being among the firsttomarket with new product offerings and achieving sufficient production volume with our new products 

to achieve consistent success with our oem customers it is important that we be an early provider of new types of disk drives featuring leading highquality technology and lower per gigabyte storage cost historically our results of operations have substantially depended upon our ability to be among the firsttomarket with new product offerings our market share and results of operations in the future may be adversely affected if we fail to 

• consistently maintain our timetomarket performance with our new products • produce these products in sufficient volume • qualify these products with key customers on a timely basis by meeting our customers performance and quality specifications or • achieve acceptable manufacturing yields quality and costs with these products if the delivery of our products is delayed our oem customers may use our competitors products to meet their production requirements if the delay of our products causes delivery of those oems computer systems into which our products are integrated to be delayed consumers and businesses may purchase comparable products from the oems competitors 

we face the related risk that consumers and businesses may wait to make their purchases if they want to buy a new product that has been shipped or announced but not yet released if this were to occur we may be unable to sell our existing inventory of products that may be less efficient and cost effective compared to new products as a result even if we are among the firsttomarket with a given product subsequent introductions or announcements by our competitors of new products could cause us to lose revenue and not achieve a positive return on our investment in existing products and inventory 

industry demand—poor global economic conditions and changes in demand for computer systems and storage subsystems have caused and may cause in the future a decline in demand for our products 

our disk drives are components in computers computer systems storage subsystems and consumer electronics devices the demand for these products has been volatile during times of poor global economic conditions such as those that currently prevail consumer spending tends to decline and retail demand for personal computers and consumer electronics devices tends to decrease as does enterprise demand for computer systems and storage subsystems moreover unexpected slowdowns in demand for computer systems storage subsystems or consumer electronics devices generally cause sharp declines in demand for disk drive products the decline in consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services and on our financial condition and results of operations 

additional causes of declines in demand for our products in the past have included announcements or introductions of major new operating systems or semiconductor improvements or changes in consumer preferences such as the shift from desktop to notebook computers we believe these announcements and introductions have from time to time caused consumers to defer their purchases and made inventory obsolete whenever an oversupply of disk drives causes participants in our industry to have higher than anticipated inventory levels we experience even more intense price competition from other disk drive manufacturers than usual 

dependence on distributors—we are dependent on sales to distributors and retailers which may increase price erosion and the volatility of our sales 

a substantial portion of our sales has been to distributors of desktop disk drive products certain of our distributors may also market other products that compete with our products product qualification programs in this distribution channel are limited which increases the number of competing products that are available to satisfy demand particularly in times of lengthening product cycles as a result purchasing decisions in this channel are based largely on price terms and product availability sales volumes through this channel are also less predictable and subject to greater volatility than sales to our oem customers in addition the recent deterioration in business and economic conditions may exacerbate price erosion and volatility as distributors lower prices to compensate for lower demand and higher inventory levels our distributors ability to access credit for purposes of funding their operations may also affect purchases of our products by these customers 

if distributors reduce their purchases of our products or prices decline significantly in the distribution channel or if distributors experience financial difficulties or terminate their relationships with us our revenues and results of operations would be adversely affected 

dependence on sales of disk drives in consumer electronics applications—our sales of disk drives for consumer electronics applications which have contributed significant revenues to our results can experience significant volatility due to seasonal and other factors which could materially adversely impact our future results of operations 

sales of disk drives for consumer electronics applications have contributed significant revenues to our results consumer spending on consumer electronics has however and may continue to deteriorate significantly in many countries and regions including the united states due to the poor global economic conditions and increasing levels of unemployment for example factors that could influence the levels of consumer spending on consumer electronic products include volatility in fuel and other energy costs conditions in the residential real estate and mortgage markets labor and healthcare costs access to credit consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior these and other economic factors could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services and on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition the demand for consumer electronics products can be even more volatile and unpredictable than the demand for compute products in some cases our products manufactured for consumer electronics applications are uniquely configured for a single customers application which creates a risk of unwanted and unsellable inventory if the anticipated volumes are not realized this potential for unpredictable volatility is increased by the possibility of competing alternative storage technologies like flash memory meeting the customers cost and capacity metrics resulting in a rapid shift in demand from our products and disk drive technology generally to alternative storage technologies unpredictable fluctuations in demand for our products or rapid shifts in demand from our products to alternative storage technologies in new consumer electronics applications could materially adversely impact our future results of operations 

dependence on sales of disk drives directly to consumers through retail outlets—our sales of disk drives directly to consumers through retail outlets can experience significant volatility due to seasonal and other factors which could materially adversely impact our future results of operations 

we believe that industry demand for storage products in the longterm is increasing due to the proliferation of mediarich digital content in consumer applications and is fuelling increased consumer demand for storage this has led to the expansion of solutions such as external storage products to provide additional storage capacity and to secure data in case of disaster or system failure or to provide independent storage solutions for multiple users in home or small business environments consumer spending on such retail sales of our branded solutions has deteriorated in some markets and may continue 

to do so if the poor global economic conditions continue and levels of unemployment continue to increase for example factors that could influence the levels of consumer spending on such retail sales of our branded solutions include volatility in fuel and other energy costs conditions in the residential real estate and mortgage markets labor and healthcare costs access to credit consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior these and other economic factors could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services and on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition such retail sales of our branded solutions traditionally experience seasonal variability in demand with higher levels of demand in the first half of our fiscal year driven by consumer spending in the backtoschool season from late summer to fall and the traditional holiday shopping season from fall to winter additionally our ability to reach such consumers depends on our maintaining effective working relationships with major retailers and distributors failure to anticipate consumer demand for our branded solutions as well as an inability to maintain effective working relationships with retail and online distributors may adversely impact our future results of operations 

importance of controlling operating costs—if we do not control our operating expenses we will not be able to compete effectively in our industry 

our strategy involves to a substantial degree increasing revenue and product volume while at the same time controlling operating expenses if we do not control our operating expenses our ability to compete in the marketplace may be impaired in the past activities to reduce operating costs have included closures and transfers of facilities significant personnel reductions and efforts to increase automation the reduction of personnel and closure of facilities may adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in required volumes to meet customer demand and may result in other disruptions that affect our products and customer service in addition the transfer of manufacturing capacity of a product to a different facility frequently requires qualification of the new facility by some of our oem customers we cannot assure you that these activities and transfers will be implemented on a costeffective basis without delays or disruption in our production and without adversely affecting our customer relationships and results of operations 

impairment charges—we may be required to record additional impairment charges for goodwill andor other longlived assets 

we are required to assess goodwill annually for impairment or on an interim basis whenever events occur or circumstances change such as an adverse change in business climate or a decline in the overall industry that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount we are also required to test other longlived assets including acquired intangible assets and property equipment and leasehold improvements for recoverability and impairment whenever there are indicators of impairment such as an adverse change in business climate 

in the fiscal quarter ended january 2 2009 we determined that the negative impact of the current macroeconomic environment and the resulting decline in the demand for our products represented an adverse change in our business climate those circumstances required us to undertake an evaluation of our goodwill and longlived assets for impairment based on these analyses we recorded impairment charges of 23 billion for goodwill and 3 million for other longlived assets 

as of july 3 2009 we have approximately 31 million of goodwill and 23 billion of other longlived assets as part of our longterm strategy we may pursue future acquisitions of other companies or assets which could potentially increase our goodwill and other longlived assets further adverse changes in business conditions could materially impact our estimates of future operations and result in additional impairment charges to these assets if our goodwill or other longlived assets were to become further impaired our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

dependence on key customers—we may be adversely affected by the loss of or reduced delayed or cancelled purchases by one or more of our larger customers 

some of our key customers including hewlettpackard company hp dell inc dell emc corporation emc lenovo group limited lenovo and acer inc acer account for a large portion of our disk drive revenue while we have longstanding relationships with many of our customers if any of our key customers were to significantly reduce their purchases from us our results of operations would be adversely affected while sales to major customers may vary from period to period a major customer that permanently discontinues or significantly reduces its relationship with us could be difficult to replace in line with industry practice new customers usually require that we pass a lengthy and rigorous qualification process at the customers cost accordingly it may be difficult or costly for us to attract new major customers additionally mergers acquisitions consolidations or other significant transactions involving our customers generally entail risks to our business if a significant transaction involving any of our key customers results in the loss of or reduction in purchases by these key customers it could have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and prospects 

impact of technological change—increases in the areal density of disk drives may outpace customers demand for storage capacity 

the rate of increase in areal density or storage capacity per square inch on a disk may be greater than the increase in our customers demand for aggregate storage capacity particularly in certain market applications like commercial desktop compute as a result our customers storage capacity needs may be satisfied with lower priced low capacity disk drives these factors could decrease our sales especially when combined with continued price erosion which could adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in electronic data storage products—future changes in the nature of electronic data storage products may reduce demand for traditional disk drive products 

we expect that in the future new personal computing devices and products will be developed some of which such as internet appliances netbooks or mobile phones with advanced capabilities or smartphones may not contain a disk drive while we are investing development resources in designing disk drives for these new applications it is too early to assess the impact of these new applications on future demand for disk drive products products such as netbooks and smartphones some of which use alternative technologies such as flash memory optical storage and other storage technologies are becoming increasingly common and could become a significant source of competition to particular applications of our products which could adversely affect our results of operations 

new product development and technological change—if we do not develop products in time to keep pace with technological changes our results of operations will be adversely affected 

our customers have demanded new generations of disk drive products as advances in computer hardware and software have created the need for improved storage products with features such as increased storage capacity improved performance and reliability and lower cost we and our competitors have developed improved products and we will need to continue to do so in the future such product development requires significant investments in research and development we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully complete the design or introduction of new products in a timely manner that we will be able to manufacture new products in sufficient volumes with acceptable manufacturing yields that we will be able to successfully market these new products or that these products will perform to specifications on a longterm basis in addition the impact of slowing areal density growth may adversely impact our ability to be successful 

when we develop new products with higher capacity and more advanced technology our results of operations may decline because the increased difficulty and complexity associated with producing these 

products increases the likelihood of reliability quality or operability problems if our products suffer increases in failures are of low quality or are not reliable customers may reduce their purchases of our products and our manufacturing rework and scrap costs and service and warranty costs may increase in addition a decline in the reliability of our products may make us less competitive as compared with other disk drive manufacturers or competing technologies 

substantial leverage—our substantial leverage may place us at a competitive disadvantage in our industry 

we are leveraged and have significant debt service obligations we also recently completed a private offering of 430 million of 10 senior secured secondpriority notes due 2014 the 10 notes our significant debt and debt service requirements could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities for example our high level of debt presents the following risks 

• we are required to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements • our substantial leverage increases our vulnerability to economic downturns and adverse competitive and industry conditions and could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that are less leveraged • our debt service obligations could limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry and could limit our ability to pursue other business opportunities borrow more money for operations or capital in the future and implement our business strategies • our level of debt may restrict us from raising additional financing on satisfactory terms to fund working capital capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements and • covenants in our debt instruments limit our ability to pay future dividends or make other restricted payments and investments in addition because a portion of our debt bears interest at floating rates an increase in interest rates has an immediate effect on our interest expense if the extreme volatility in interest rates observed during the fiscal year 2009 continues or if interest rates increase our cash flow and our ability to service our debt may be adversely affected 

in the event that we need to refinance all or a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures we may not be able to obtain terms as favorable as the terms of our existing debt or refinance our existing debt at all if prevailing interest rates or other factors existing at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing then the interest expense relating to the refinanced debt would increase furthermore if any rating agency changes our credit rating or outlook our debt and equity securities could be negatively affected which could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt or raise additional capital 

significant debt service requirements—servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate cash may be affected by factors beyond our control 

our business may not generate cash flow in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay the principal of or interest on our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs including working capital capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements 

our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control we cannot assure you that 

• our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations • we will continue to realize the cost savings revenue growth and operating improvements that result from the execution of our longterm strategic plan or • future sources of funding will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs if we cannot fund our liquidity needs we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements we cannot assure you that any of these remedies could if necessary be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all or that they would permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations our amended credit facility and the indenture governing our 10 notes limit the use of certain proceeds from any disposition of assets that are part of the collateral and as a result we may not be allowed under those documents to use proceeds from such dispositions to satisfy all current debt service obligations in addition if we incur additional debt the risks associated with our substantial leverage including the risk that we will be unable to service our debt or generate enough cash flow to fund our liquidity needs could intensify 

restrictions imposed by debt covenants—restrictions imposed by our amended credit facility and the indenture governing our 10 senior secured secondpriority notes due 2014 may limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in our interest 

our amended credit facility and the indenture governing our 10 notes impose and the terms of any future debt may impose operating and other restrictions on us our amended credit facility and the indenture limit among other things our ability to 

• incur additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock • create liens • pay dividends or make distributions in respect of our capital stock • redeem or repurchase capital stock or debt • make certain investments or other restricted payments • sell assets • issue or sell capital stock of subsidiaries • enter into transactions with affiliates • engage to any material extent in business other than our current business and • effect a consolidation or merger these limitations are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions including exceptions under our amended credit facility that permit us to pay dividends up to 45 million in the aggregate during the period beginning on april 4 2009 and ending on january 1 2010 inclusive and 300 million in the aggregate during any period of four consecutive quarters thereafter 

our amended credit facility also requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial covenants specifically our amended credit facility contains three financial covenants 1 a covenant to maintain minimum cash cash equivalents and marketable securities 2 a fixed charge coverage ratio and 3 a net leverage ratio our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our 

control our recently amended credit agreement governing our credit facility provides for the relaxation of certain financial covenants through the quarter ending on january 1 2010 and based on our current outlook we expect to stay in compliance with these covenants however after january 1 2010 the financial metrics we are required to maintain under these covenants will revert back to their previous levels if our business deteriorates or if business conditions worsen we may need to further renegotiate these covenants obtain waivers andor raise additional funds in order to remain in compliance 

a breach of any of the covenants in our debt agreements including our inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our amended credit facility if a condition of default occurs and we are not able to obtain a waiver from the lenders holding a majority of the commitments under our amended credit facility the administrative agent of the amended credit facility may and at the request of lenders holding a majority of the commitments shall declare all of our outstanding obligations under the amended credit facility together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable and may terminate the lenders commitments thereunder cease making further loans and if we cannot repay our outstanding obligation institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets if our outstanding indebtedness were to be accelerated we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full that debt and any potential future indebtedness which would cause the market price of our common shares to decline significantly we could also be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 

in addition some of the agreements governing our other debt instruments contain crossdefault provisions that may be triggered by a default under our amended credit facility in the event that we default under our amended credit facility there could be an event of default under crossdefault provisions for the applicable debt instrument as a result all outstanding obligations under certain of our debt instruments including our 10 notes may become immediately due and payable if such acceleration were to occur we may not have adequate funds to satisfy all of our outstanding obligations the lenders could exercise their rights as described above and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 

substantially all of our assets are pledged as collateral to secure certain indebtedness—since substantially all of our assets are used to secure portions of our existing debt obligations we may be limited in our ability to incur additional indebtedness or to provide additional credit support and if we fail to meet our payment or other obligations under certain of our existing debt obligations the lenders thereunder could foreclose on and acquire control of substantially all of our assets 

substantially all our assets and the assets of our material subsidiaries organized in the united states the cayman islands the netherlands northern ireland and singapore as well as certain assets located in the united states the cayman islands the netherlands northern ireland and singapore owned by other material subsidiaries and all proceeds therefrom are pledged as security for borrowings under our amended credit facility and our 10 notes as well as obligations under our hedging agreements cash management arrangements and certain metal leasing arrangements since substantially all of our assets are used to secure portions of our existing debt obligations we have a limited amount of collateral that is available for future secured debt or credit support as a result we may be limited in our ability to incur additional indebtedness or to provide additional credit support for our existing indebtedness in addition our failure to comply with the terms of our amended credit facility or the indenture governing our 10 notes would entitle the lenders thereunder to declare all funds borrowed thereunder to be immediately due and payable if we were unable to meet these payment obligations the lenders could foreclose on and acquire control of substantially all our assets that serve as collateral 

volatile public markets—the price of our common shares may be volatile and could decline significantly 

the stock market in general and the market for technology stocks in particular has recently experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of companies if these market or industrybased fluctuations continue the trading price of our common shares could decline 

significantly independent of our actual operating performance and you could lose all or a substantial part of your investment the market price of our common shares could fluctuate significantly in response to several factors including among others 

• general uncertainty in stock market conditions occasioned by global economic conditions negative financial news and the continued instability of several large financial institutions • actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations • announcements of innovations new products or significant price reductions by us or our competitors including those competitors who offer alternative storage technology solutions • our failure to meet the performance estimates of investment research analysts • the timing of announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts or acquisitions • general stock market conditions • the occurrence of major catastrophic events • changes in financial estimates by investment research analysts • changes in the credit ratings of our indebtedness by rating agencies and • the sale of our common shares held by certain equity investors or members of management purchase commitments to certain suppliers—if revenues fall or customer demand decreases significantly we may not meet all of our purchase commitments to certain suppliers 

from time to time we enter into longterm noncancelable purchase commitments with certain suppliers in order to secure certain components for the production of our products or to supplement our internal manufacturing capacity for certain components if our actual revenues in the future are lower than our projections or if customer demand decreases significantly below our projections we may not meet all of our purchase commitments with these suppliers as a result it is possible that we will have to shift output from our internal manufacturing facilities to these suppliers or make penaltytype payments under these contracts 

perpendicular recording technology—products based on perpendicular technology require increased quantities of precious metals and scarce alloys like platinum and ruthenium which increase the risks of higher costs and production delays that could adversely impact our results of operations 

perpendicular recording technology requires recording media with more layers which requires the use of more precious metals and scarce alloys like platinum and ruthenium to create such layers these precious metals and scarce alloys could become increasingly expensive and at times difficult to acquire accordingly we will be exposed to the increased risk that higher costs or reduced availability of these precious metals and scarce alloys could adversely impact our results of operations 

risks associated with future strategic alliances joint ventures or investments—we may not be able to identify suitable strategic alliances acquisitions joint ventures or investment opportunities or successfully acquire and integrate companies that provide complementary products or technologies 

our growth strategy may involve pursuing strategic alliances with making acquisitions of forming joint ventures with or making investments in other companies that are complementary to our business there is substantial competition for attractive strategic alliance acquisition joint venture and investment candidates accordingly we may not be able to identify suitable strategic alliances acquisition joint venture or investment candidates even if we can identify them we cannot assure you that we will be able to partner with acquire or invest in suitable candidates or integrate acquired technologies or operations 

successfully into our existing technologies and operations moreover our ability to finance potential strategic alliances acquisitions joint ventures or investments will be limited by our high degree of leverage the covenants contained in the indentures that govern our outstanding indebtedness the credit agreement that governs our senior secured credit facility and any agreements governing any other debt we may incur 

if we are successful in forming strategic alliances or acquiring forming joint ventures or making investments in other companies any of these transactions may have an adverse effect on our results of operations particularly while the operations of an acquired business are being integrated it is also likely that integration of acquired companies would lead to the loss of key employees from those companies or the loss of customers of those companies in addition the integration of any acquired companies would require substantial attention from our senior management which may limit the amount of time available to be devoted to our daytoday operations or to the execution of our strategy growth by strategic alliance acquisition joint venture or investment involves an even higher degree of risk to the extent we combine new product offerings and enter new markets in which we have limited experience and no assurance can be given that acquisitions of entities with new or alternative business models will be successfully integrated or achieve their stated objectives 

furthermore the expansion of our business involves the risk that we might not manage our growth effectively that we would incur additional debt to finance these acquisitions or investments that we may have impairment of goodwill or acquired intangible assets associated with these acquisitions and that we would incur substantial charges relating to the writeoff of inprocess research and development similar to that which we incurred in connection with several of our prior acquisitions each of these items could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we could issue additional common shares in connection with future strategic alliances acquisitions joint ventures or investments issuing shares in connection with such transactions would have the effect of diluting your ownership percentage of the common shares and could cause the price of our common shares to decline 

risk of intellectual property litigation—our products may infringe the intellectual property rights of others which may cause us to incur unexpected costs or prevent us from selling our products 

we cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of others we may not be aware of currently filed patent applications that relate to our products or technology if patents are later issued on these applications we may be liable for infringement we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims including claims of alleged infringement of the patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties by us or our customers in connection with their use of our products 

we are currently subject to lawsuits involving intellectual property claims which could cause us to incur significant additional costs or prevent us from selling our products and which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition actions brought in the united states by convolve inc and the massachusetts institute of technology qimonda ag and siemens ag which seagate won at trial and is now on appeal and an action brought in northern ireland by siemens ag 

intellectual property litigation is expensive and timeconsuming regardless of the merits of any claim and could divert our managements attention from operating our business in addition intellectual property lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties due to the complexity of the technical issues involved and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in defending ourselves against intellectual property claims patent litigation has increased due to the current uncertainty of the law and the increasing competition and overlap of product functionality in the field if we were to discover that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of others we would need to obtain licenses from these parties or substantially reengineer our products in order to avoid infringement we might not be able to obtain the 

necessary licenses on acceptable terms or at all or be able to reengineer our products successfully moreover if we are sued for patent infringement and lose the suit we could be required to pay substantial damages andor be enjoined from using or selling the infringing products or technology any of the foregoing could cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling our products which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition see part ii item 8 note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form 10k for a description of pending intellectual property proceedings 

dependence on key personnel—the loss of some key executive officers and employees could negatively impact our business prospects 

our future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued service of key members of management as well as marketing sales and product development personnel the loss of one or more of our key personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we believe our future success will also depend in large part upon our ability to attract retain and further motivate highly skilled management marketing sales and product development personnel we have experienced intense competition for personnel and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our key employees or that we will be successful in attracting assimilating and retaining personnel in the future 

system failures—system failures caused by events beyond our control could adversely affect computer equipment and electronic data on which our operations depend 

our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer equipment and the electronic data stored in our databases from damage by among other things earthquake fire natural disaster power loss telecommunications failures unauthorized intrusion and other catastrophic events as our operations become more automated and increasingly interdependent our exposure to the risks posed by these types of events will increase while we continue to improve our disaster recovery processes system failures and other interruptions in our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

economic risks associated with international operations—our international operations subject us to risks related to currency exchange fluctuations longer payment cycles for sales in foreign countries seasonality and disruptions in foreign markets tariffs and duties price controls potential adverse tax consequences increased costs our customers credit and access to capital and healthrelated risks 

we have significant operations in foreign countries including manufacturing facilities sales personnel and customer support operations we have manufacturing facilities in china malaysia northern ireland singapore and thailand in addition to those in the united states a substantial portion of our desktop disk drive assembly occurs in our facility in china 

our international operations are subject to economic risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries including the following 

• disruptions in foreign markets disruptions in financial markets and the deterioration of the underlying economic conditions in the past in some countries including those in asia have had an impact on our sales to customers located in or whose enduser customers are located in these countries • fluctuations in currency exchange rates prices for our products are denominated predominately in us dollars even when sold to customers that are located outside the united states currency instability in asia and other geographic markets may make our products more expensive than products sold by other manufacturers that are priced in the local currency moreover many of the costs associated with our operations located outside the united states are denominated in local 34 

currencies as a consequence the increased strength of local currencies against the us dollar in countries where we have foreign operations would result in higher effective operating costs and potentially reduced earnings from time to time fluctuations in foreign exchange rates have negatively affected our operations and profitability and there can be no assurance that these fluctuations will not adversely affect our operations and profitability in the future 

• longer payment cycles our customers outside of the united states are often allowed longer time periods for payment than our us customers this increases the risk of nonpayment due to the possibility that the financial condition of particular customers may worsen during the course of the payment period • seasonality seasonal reductions in the business activities of our customers during the summer months particularly in europe typically result in lower earnings during those periods • tariffs duties limitations on trade and price controls our international operations are affected by limitations on imports currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations price controls and other restraints on trade in addition the governments of many countries including china malaysia northern ireland singapore and thailand in which we have significant operating assets have exercised and continue to exercise significant influence over many aspects of their domestic economies and international trade • potential adverse tax consequences our international operations create a risk of potential adverse tax consequences including imposition of withholding or other taxes on payments by subsidiaries • increased costs the shipping and transportation costs associated with our international operations are typically higher than those associated with our us operations resulting in decreased operating margins in some foreign countries • credit and access to capital risks our international customers could have reduced access to working capital due to higher interest rates reduced bank lending resulting from contractions in the money supply or the deterioration in the customers or its banks financial condition or the inability to access other financing • global health outbreaks the occurrence of a pandemic disease caused by a virus such as h1n1 or the swine flu virus may adversely impact our operations and some of our key customers such diseases could also potentially disrupt the timeliness and reliability of the distribution network we rely on political risks associated with international operations—our international operations subject us to risks related to political unrest and terrorism 

we have manufacturing facilities in parts of the world that periodically experience political unrest with thailand being a recent example this could disrupt our ability to manufacture important components as well as cause interruptions andor delays in our ability to ship components to other locations for continued manufacture and assembly any such delays or interruptions could result in delays in our ability to fill orders and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition us and international responses to the ongoing hostilities in afghanistan and iraq and the risk of terrorist attacks or hostilities elsewhere in the world could exacerbate these risks 

legal and operational risks associated with international operations—our international operations subject us to risks related to staffing and management legal and regulatory requirements and the protection of intellectual property 

operating outside of the united states creates difficulties associated with staffing and managing our international manufacturing facilities complying with local legal and regulatory requirements and 

protecting our intellectual property we cannot assure you that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with applicable customs currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which we may be subject we also cannot assure you that these laws will not be modified 

sox 404 compliance—while we believe that we currently have adequate internal control procedures in place we are still exposed to future risks of noncompliance and will continue to incur costs associated with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 

annually we complete an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as required by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 although our assessment testing and evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of july 3 2009 our internal control over financial reporting was effective we cannot predict the outcome of our testing in future periods if our internal controls are ineffective in future periods our financial results or the market price of our shares could be adversely affected we will incur additional expenses and commitment of managements time in connection with further evaluations 

suspension of paying quarterly dividends—our policy of not paying dividends could result in a persistently low market valuation of our common shares 

on april 13 2009 we announced that we had adopted a policy of no longer paying a quarterly dividend to our common shareholders to enhance liquidity our policy of not paying a quarterly dividend could result in a persistently low market valuation of our common shares 

our ability to pay quarterly dividends in the future will be subject to among other things general business conditions within the disk drive industry our financial results the impact of paying dividends on our credit ratings and legal and contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends by our subsidiaries to us or by us to our common shareholders including restrictions imposed by our amended credit facility specifically under the terms and conditions of our recently amended credit agreement governing our credit facility we are restricted from paying dividends in excess of 45 million in the aggregate during the period beginning on april 4 2009 and ending on january 1 2010 inclusive and in excess of 300 million in the aggregate during any period of four consecutive quarters thereafter in addition payment of dividends to holders of our common shares in certain future quarters may result in upward adjustments to the conversion rate of the 2375 convertible senior notes due august 2012 

potential governmental action—governmental action against companies located in offshore jurisdictions may lead to a reduction in the demand for our common shares 

recent us federal and state legislation has been proposed and additional legislation may be proposed in the future which if enacted could have an adverse tax impact on either seagate or its shareholders 

securities litigation—significant fluctuations in the market price of our common shares could result in securities class action claims against us 

significant price and value fluctuations have occurred with respect to the publicly traded securities of disk drive companies and technology companies generally the price of our common shares is likely to be volatile in the future in the past following periods of decline in the market price of a companys securities class action lawsuits have often been pursued against that company if similar litigation were pursued against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources which could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

current global credit and financial market conditions—current global credit and financial market conditions could negatively impact the value of our current portfolio of cash equivalents shortterm investments or auction rate securities and our ability to meet our financing objectives 

our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase our shortterm investments consist primarily of readily marketable debt securities with remaining maturities of more than 90 days at the time of purchase our investment policy has as its principal objectives the preservation of principal and maintenance of liquidity we mitigate default risk by investing in highquality investment grade securities limiting the time to maturity and by monitoring the counterparties and underlying obligors closely 

as of july 3 2009 we held auction rate securities with a par value of 21 million all of which are collateralized by student loans guaranteed by the federal family education loan program in february 2009 we sold auction rate securities with a par value of 10 million for 8 million recognizing a 2 million loss on the transaction in addition in february 2009 the ratings of two of the three remaining auction rate securities held by us having an aggregate par value of 21 million were downgraded as of july 3 2009 the estimated fair value of the remaining auction rate securities was 18 million we believe that the impairments of these securities totaling 3 million as of july 3 2009 are temporary given our ability and intent to hold these securities until liquidity returns to this market or until maturity of the securities 

while as of the date of this filing we are not aware of any other material downgrades losses or other significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or shortterm investments or auction rate securities since july 3 2009 no assurance can be given that further deterioration in conditions of the global credit and financial markets would not negatively impact our current portfolio of cash equivalents shortterm investments or auction rate securities or our ability to meet our financing objectives 

environmental regulations—failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the sale and manufacturing of products in certain states and countries may subject us to environmental and other regulations including in some instances the responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling for example the european union has enacted the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment rohs directive which prohibits the use of certain substances in electronic equipment and the waste electrical and electronic equipment weee directive which obligates parties that place electrical and electronic equipment onto the market in the eu to put a clearly identifiable mark on the equipment register with and report to eu member countries regarding distribution of the equipment and provide a mechanism to takeback and properly dispose of the equipment similar legislation may be enacted in other locations where we manufacture or sell our products although we do not anticipate any material adverse effects based on the nature of our operations and the focus of such legislation we will need to ensure that we comply with these laws and regulations as they are enacted and that our suppliers also comply with these laws and regulations if we fail to timely comply with the legislation our customers may refuse to purchase our products which would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition if we were found to be in violation of these laws or noncompliance with these initiatives or standards of conduct we could be subject to governmental fines liability to our customers and damage to our reputation which would also have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

our material manufacturing product development and marketing and administrative facilities at july 3 2009 are as follows 



1 land leases for these facilities expire at varying dates through 2067 as of july 3 2009 we owned or leased a total of approximately 114 million square feet of space worldwide we occupied approximately 65 million square feet for the purpose of manufacturing 13 million square feet for product development 13 million square feet for marketing and administrative purposes and subleased 07 million included in the 114 million square feet of owned or leased space is a total of 16 million square feet that is currently unoccupied primarily as a result of site closures at our facilities in limavady milpitas and pittsburgh we believe that our existing properties are in good operating condition and are suitable and adequate for the operations for which they are used as of july 3 2009 all of our material manufacturing facilities are operating at normal utilization levels and none of our manufacturing facilities are experiencing significant underutilization 

on august 4 2009 we announced that we would close our ang mo kio amk facility in singapore by the end of calendar year 2010 our hard drive manufacturing operations will be relocated to other existing facilities and our asia international headquarters ihq will remain in singapore we do not expect the closure to meaningfully change production capacity

dividends 

on april 13 2009 we announced that we adopted a policy of no longer paying a quarterly dividend to our common shareholders to enhance liquidity the suspension of paying quarterly dividends could cause the market price of our common shares to decline significantly and our failure or inability to resume paying dividends at historical levels could result in a persistently low market valuation of our common shares 

our ability to pay quarterly dividends in the future will be subject to among other things general business conditions within the disk drive industry our financial results the impact of paying dividends on our credit ratings and legal and contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends by our subsidiaries to us or by us to our common shareholders including restrictions imposed by our amended credit facility and our 10 notes specifically under the terms and conditions of our recently amended credit agreement governing our credit facility we are restricted from paying dividends in excess of 45 million in the aggregate during the period beginning on april 4 2009 and ending on january 1 2010 inclusive and in excess of 300 million in the aggregate during any period of four consecutive quarters thereafter until maturity of the credit agreement in addition the indenture to our 10 senior secured secondpriority notes due may 2014 have covenants that will be effective after the maturity of the credit agreement in addition any payment of dividends to holders of our common shares in certain future quarters may result in upward adjustments to the conversion rate of the 2375 convertible senior notes due august 2012 

since the closing of our initial public offering in december 2002 up to our policy change on april 13 2009 we have paid dividends pursuant to our quarterly dividend policy then in effect totaling approximately 952 million in the aggregate the following are dividends paid in the last two fiscal years 



for us federal tax purposes we had cumulative earnings and profits in excess of distributions for our taxable year ended july 3 2009 as a result distributions on our common shares to us shareholders during this period were treated as dividend income for us federal income tax purposes nonus shareholders should consult with a tax advisor to determine appropriate tax treatment 

repurchases of our equity securities

we are the worlds leading provider of hard disk drives based on revenue we design manufacture market and sell hard disk drives we produce a broad range of disk drive products addressing enterprise applications where our products are used in enterprise servers mainframes and workstations desktop applications where our products are used in desktop computers mobile computing applications where our products are used in notebook computers and consumer electronics applications where our products are used in a wide variety of devices such as digital video recorders dvrs and other consumer electronic devices that require storage we also sell our branded storage solutions under both the seagate and maxtor brands in addition to manufacturing and selling disk drives we provide data storage services for small to mediumsized businesses including online backup data protection and recovery solutions 

business overview 

our industry is characterized by several trends that have a material impact on our strategic planning financial condition and results of operations 

demand for disk drives 

the disk drive industry is sensitive to global macroeconomic conditions and has been impacted by the downturn in economic activity as a result we believe the total available market tam for disk drives in aggregate declined approximately 4 in fiscal year 2009 over the prior fiscal year compared to an increase of 18 and 14 in the tam in fiscal year 2008 and fiscal year 2007 respectively notwithstanding current economic conditions we believe that growth in digital content will continue to require increasingly higher storage capacity in order to store aggregate host distribute manage back up and use such content we believe this growth in digital content will result in increased demand for disk drive products 

historically the electronic data storage industry has introduced alternative technologies that directly compete with hard disk drives solid state disk drives ssds using nand flash memory are a potential alternative to disk drives in certain applications such as consumer handheld devices and portable external storage we believe that in the foreseeable future the traditional compute markets that require high volume storage solutions as well as the data intensive noncompute markets will continue to be best served by hard disk drives based on the industrys ability to deliver reliable and cost effective mass storage devices 

disk drives for desktop computing the desktop computing market consists of disk drives used in traditional desktop and business critical applications we believe that the global macroeconomic conditions coupled with the continuing shift towards notebook computing have contributed to a 13 decline in demand for disk drives for desktop computing as compared to the prior fiscal year additionally we believe the demand for disk drives for desktop computing may be adversely impacted as consumers increasingly choose notebooks for their computing needs we believe that current growth opportunities for disk drives in traditional desktop computing applications lie primarily in developing markets where price remains a primary consideration 

disk drives for mobile computing the mobile compute market consists primarily of disk drives used in notebook systems notebook systems are increasingly becoming the preference over desktop computers for both consumers and enterprises as the need for mobility increases wireless adoption continues to advance and price and performance continue to improve consequently the mobile compute market exhibited a 16 growth as compared to the prior fiscal year 

ssds could become more competitive in the future in mobile compute applications which require minimal storage capacity such as netbooks which are smaller less powerful less expensive forms of mobile computers and are slowly becoming a lowcost alternative to notebooks we estimate that netbooks will comprise as much as 10 – 15 of the mobile market for the next few years and that 80 of these devices will have hard disk drives installed initially 

disk drives for enterprise storage we define enterprise storage as disk drives used in mission critical applications which is defined by the use of high performance high capacity disk drives in applications that are vital to the operation of enterprises we expect the market for mission critical enterprise storage solutions to be driven by enterprises continuing to move network traffic to dedicated storage area networks in addition as enterprises move away from the use of serverattached storage to networkattached storage and consolidate data centers to increase speed and reliability within a smaller space reduce network complexity and increase energy savings this will lead to an increased demand for more energy efficient smaller form factor disk drives these solutions are comprised principally of high performance enterprise class disk drives with sophisticated firmware and communications technologies we believe that the enterprise storage tam declined 18 as compared to the prior fiscal year mainly due to the downturn in the economy and the consolidation in the financial services industry traditionally a significant portion of the market for enterprise disk drives we also believe that the global macroeconomic conditions have changed enterprise spending behaviors evidenced by increased storage utilization rates in data centers and deferred purchases of information technology equipment 

ssd storage applications have been introduced as a potential alternative to redundant system startup or boot disk drives and applications where rapid processing is required for high volume transaction data tier 0 the timing of significant adoption of ssds in these applications is currently unknown as enterprises weigh the cost benefits of mission critical enterprise disk drives relative to the perceived performance benefits of ssds we anticipate that tier 0 is likely to benefit the most from the adoption of ssds we estimate the current penetration of ssds to be less than 1 based on units 

disk drives for consumer electronics disk drives in the consumer electronics ce markets are primarily used in gaming and highcapacity video solutions such as dvrs these applications require more storage capability than can be provided in a costeffective manner through alternative technologies such as flash memory which is used in lower capacity ce applications we believe that the global macroeconomic conditions have contributed to the 11 decline in the ce tam as compared to the prior fiscal year notwithstanding the current contraction in consumer spending we believe the demand for disk drives in ce will be driven by increased amounts of high definition content requiring larger amounts of storage capacity 

disk drives for branded solutions we define branded solutions as external disk drives sold in the retail channel disk drives used in branded solutions are for purposes such as personal backup portable data storage and to augment their current desktop or notebook disk drive capacities notwithstanding the current contraction in consumer spending we believe the proliferation of mediarich digital content will continue to create increasing consumer demand for external branded storage solutions our branded solutions disk drives are accounted for within our mobile and desktop compute markets 

product life cycles and changing technology 

our industry has been characterized by significant advances in technology which have contributed to rapid product life cycles as a result success in our industry has been dependent to a large extent on the ability to be the firsttomarket with new products allowing those disk drive manufacturers who introduce new products first to sell those products at a premium until comparable products are introduced also because our industry is characterized by continuous price erosion the existence of rapid product life cycles has necessitated the need to quickly achieve product cost effectiveness changing technology also necessitates the need for ongoing investments in research and development which may be difficult to recover due to rapid product life cycles and economic declines further there is a continued need to successfully execute product transitions and new product introductions as factors such as quality reliability and manufacturing yields become of increasing competitive importance 

seasonality 

the disk drive industry traditionally experiences seasonal variability in demand with higher levels of demand in the second half of the calendar year this seasonality is driven by consumer spending in the backtoschool season from late summer to fall and the traditional holiday shopping season from fall to winter in addition corporate demand is typically higher during the second half of the calendar year in fiscal year 2009 due to the disruptions from the macroeconomic conditions the industry did not exhibit the increase in demand from late summer to fall and the traditional holiday shopping season from fall to winter until the macroeconomic environment improves we may not experience traditional seasonal demand patterns 

price erosion 

our industry has been characterized by continuous price declines for disk drive products with comparable capacity performance and feature sets likeforlike products price declines for likeforlike products price erosion are more pronounced during periods of 

• economic contraction or industry consolidation in which competitors may use discounted pricing to attempt to maintain or gain market share • few new product introductions when multiple competitors have comparable or alternative product offerings • temporary imbalances between industry supply and demand and • seasonally weaker demand which may cause excess supply disk drive manufacturers typically attempt to offset price erosion with an improved mix of disk drive products characterized by higher capacity better performance and additional feature sets andor product cost reductions to remain competitive we believe it will be necessary to continue to reduce prices as well as introduce new product offerings that utilize advanced technologies ahead of our competitors in order to take advantage of potentially higher initial profit margins and reduced cost structure on these new products 

we experienced near doubledigit price erosion during each of the first two quarters of fiscal year 2009 due to a supply and demand imbalance resulting from a sharp decline in the demand for disk drives as a result of the macroeconomic downturn conversely we experienced more benign price erosion in the june 2009 quarter as the supply and demand rebalanced 

disk drive industry consolidation 

due to the significant challenges posed by the need to continually innovate and improve manufacturing efficiency and the continued demands on capital and research and development 

investments required to do so the disk drive industry has undergone significant consolidation as disk drive manufacturers and component manufacturers merged with other companies or exited the industry the trend toward consolidation is more pronounced during times of macroeconomic contraction for example toshiba recently announced that it intends to acquire fujitsus hard disk drive business the increasing technological challenges associated levels of investment and competitive necessity of largescale operations may also drive future industry consolidation additionally we may in the future face indirect competition from customers who from time to time evaluate whether to offer electronic data storage products that may compete with our products 

suppliers of components and capital equipment 

due to industry consolidation which may be accelerated by the current macroeconomic conditions there are a limited number of independent suppliers of components such as recording heads and media available to disk drive manufacturers vertically integrated disk drive manufacturers who manufacture their own components are less dependent on external component suppliers than less vertically integrated disk drive manufacturers 

generally we believe that there is more than adequate supply of components to meet currently identified industry demand however we believe that the supply of glass substrates a component in mobile disk drives may be below adequate levels to support demand for mobile drives this supply constraint may be particularly pronounced if global macroeconomic conditions improve in the near term or if the shift in demand from desktop to mobile accelerates 

drive manufacturers have adjusted their capital spending plans in reaction to the reduction in demand as a result capital equipment manufacturers may be increasingly financially constrained and therefore may be less able to supply equipment when needed 

recording heads and media 

we maintain a highly integrated approach to our business by designing and manufacturing a significant portion of the components we view as critical to our products such as recording heads and media however a vertically integrated model tends to have less flexibility when there is a constraint in demand and exposes us to higher unit costs in a down cycle as a result of the global macroeconomic conditions our manufacturing operations experienced a sharp reduction in utilization levels in portions of fiscal year 2009 

the extent of our use of externally sourced recording heads media and aluminum substrates varies based on product mix technology and our internal capacity levels we purchase from third parties all of our glass substrates which are used to manufacture our disk drives for mobile and small form factor ce products 

commodity and other manufacturing costs 

the production of disk drives requires precious metals scarce alloys and industrial commodities that are subject to fluctuations in prices and the supply of which has at times been constrained in order to mitigate susceptibility to these conditions we may maintain increased inventory of precious metals scarce alloys and industrial commodities we believe that currently there is adequate supply of these precious metals scarce alloys and industrial commodities additionally volatility in fuel costs may increase our costs related to commodities manufacturing and freight therefore we may increase our use of ocean shipments to help offset any increase in freight costs 

industry supply balance 

from time to time the industry has experienced periods of imbalances between supply and demand in the december 2008 quarter the economic downturn created a sharp imbalance as a result the disk drive industry including seagate adjusted production to realign to the lower demand the industry as well as seagate exited the june 2009 quarter with what we believe to be approximately four weeks of distribution channel inventory which is at the low end of historical levels 

fiscal year 2009 summary 

our operating results for fiscal year 2009 were significantly impacted by the decline in the global macroeconomic environment revenues for the fiscal year 2009 were 98 billion and gross margins were 14 which represented a 23 decrease in revenues and a compression of our gross margins by 1100 basis points when compared to the prior fiscal year 

during the december 2008 quarter we observed a sharp deterioration in the general business environment in all of our major markets and we determined that a significant adverse change in our business climate had occurred consequently we recorded impairment charges of approximately 23 billion for goodwill additionally in the december 2008 quarter as part of our tax provision we recorded a 271 million unfavorable adjustment to the valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets 

in january 2009 we made substantial changes to our management team and began to implement organizational changes intended to improve decision making resource allocation and overall corporate performance we also implemented actions directed at strengthening the balance sheet and returning to profitability by improving our product competitiveness realigning our cost structure to current economic conditions and refinancing our debt 

our fiscal year 2009 results were also impacted by the residual effects of our prior fiscal years new product execution issues in certain markets we experienced delays in transitioning to market competitive and more cost efficient products which resulted in our losing timetomarket leadership in these markets we believe we have made significant progress in addressing our product timetomarket execution by the end of the fiscal year 2009 the transition to more market competitive product offerings which are also more cost effective contributed to a significant recovery in our gross margin in the june 2009 quarter as compared to the immediately preceding quarter 

in addition we implemented cost reduction activities that included completing the previously announced closures of our milpitas media manufacturing facility and our pittsburgh research facility reducing global workforce by approximately 5500 employees including over 25 of our corporate officers and salary reductions for substantially all professional employees 

we also improved our liquidity position and capital structure by amending our credit facility to relax certain financial covenants issuing 10 notes in the aggregate principal amount of 430 million and improving working capital management 

results of operations 

the following table summarizes information from our consolidated statements of operations by dollars and as a percentage of revenue 



  



the following table summarizes information regarding volume shipments average selling prices asps and revenues by channel and geography 



fiscal year 2009 compared to fiscal year 2008 

revenue 



revenue in fiscal year 2009 decreased approximately 23 or 29 billion from fiscal year 2008 primarily due to declining global macroeconomic conditions these conditions resulted in a 10 decrease in the number of disk drives shipped and a 13 reduction in our asp from 68 to 59 per unit the decrease in our asp as compared to the prior fiscal year resulted from an unfavorable product mix as higherpriced enterprise drives comprised a smaller percentage of the units shipped and a near doubledigit price erosion during each of the first two quarters of fiscal year 2009 the near doubledigit price erosion we experienced was due to timetomarket delays in certain markets and a supply and demand imbalance resulting from a sharp decline in the tam in the december 2008 quarter 

we maintain various sales programs such as pointofsale rebates sales price adjustments and price protection aimed at increasing customer demand we exercise judgment in formulating the underlying estimates related to distributor and retail inventory levels sales program participation and customer claims submittals in determining the provision for such programs sales programs recorded as contra revenue were approximately 12 and 9 of our gross revenue for fiscal years 2009 and 2008 respectively 

desktop we shipped 933 million units during fiscal year 2009 a decrease of 16 from the prior fiscal year due mainly to a 13 decline in the tam we believe we have maintained revenue leadership in this market the decrease in both our shipments and the tam was primarily driven by lower consumer and enterprise spending as a result of the macroeconomic downturn and the continued shift in demand from desktop to notebook computers 

mobile we believe the overall mobile compute market grew approximately 16 from fiscal year 2008 with seagate shipping 376 million units in fiscal year 2009 an increase of 41 over fiscal year 2008 the increase in unit shipments was driven by more competitive product offerings as well as the continuing shift from desktop towards notebook computers by both consumers and enterprises 

enterprise during fiscal year 2009 we have maintained our market leadership position in the enterprise market shipping 165 million units a decrease of 19 as compared to the prior fiscal year of 203 million units the overall enterprise market decreased by 18 due to the macroeconomic contraction and the resulting consolidation in the financial services industry 

consumer electronics in fiscal year 2009 we shipped a total of 164 million units in the ce market a decrease of 33 from fiscal year 2008 our decision not to participate in the economically unattractive gaming market was the primary reason for the decline in units shipped as compared to the prior fiscal year in addition reduced consumer spending resulting from the macroeconomic conditions also contributed to this decrease 

gross margin 



for fiscal year 2009 gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased 1100 basis points primarily due to price erosion lower capacity utilization particularly in the december 2008 and the march 2009 quarters and the delay in transitioning to more marketcompetitive and costefficient products in certain markets due to the residual effects of prior fiscal year execution issues in the december 2008 quarter the supply and demand imbalance resulted in a very competitive pricing environment and significant price erosion especially in the 35inch and 25inch ata markets 

operating expenses 



product development expense the decrease in product development expense for fiscal year 2009 was primarily due to 82 million of variable performancebased compensation expense in fiscal year 2008 while none was recognized in fiscal year 2009 restructuring and other cost reduction efforts contributed to a further 35 million reduction in product development expenses as compared to the prior fiscal year these cost reduction measures included the closure of the pittsburgh facility headcount reductions and wage decreases that took place in the second half of the fiscal year in addition other employee benefits decreased by 20 million due to changes in deferred compensation plan liabilities and a 13 million research grant was received in the current fiscal year these decreases were partially offset by a 23 million increase in payroll expense due to annual wage increases and a 53week fiscal year in 2009 compared to 52 weeks in fiscal year 2008 20 million in operating expenses resulting from increased product 

development and licensing activities and 26 million of accelerated depreciation expense related to the closure of our pittsburgh facility 

marketing and administrative expense the decrease in marketing and administrative expense for fiscal year 2009 was primarily due to 53 million of variable performancebased compensation expense in fiscal year 2008 while none was recognized in fiscal year 2009 in the second half of the fiscal year 2009 restructuring and other cost reduction efforts contributed to further reductions of 25 million in wages 29 million for reduced use of consultants and outside services and 15 million as a result of reduced travel additionally other employee benefits decreased by 11 million due to changes in deferred compensation plan liabilities these decreases were partially offset by a 14 million increase in payroll expense due to annual wage increases and a 53week fiscal year in 2009 compared to 52 weeks in fiscal year 2008 

amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles was relatively flat when compared to the prior fiscal year 

restructuring and other net during fiscal year 2009 we recorded restructuring and other charges of 210 million comprised mainly of charges related to the restructuring plans announced in january and may 2009 both intended to realign our cost structure with the current macroeconomic business environment these charges consisted of 173 million of employee termination benefits 31 million related to lease obligations associated with the site closures and 6 million of other exit costs as of the dates we committed to these restructuring plans we estimated annual savings upon completion of 130 million and 125 million from the january and may 2009 restructuring plans respectively and 30 million 42 million and 34 million from the pittsburgh milpitas and limavady site closures respectively 

impairment of goodwill and other longlived assets during the december 2008 quarter we determined that a significant adverse change to our business climate had occurred which required that we evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill and other longlived assets principally intangible assets and property equipment and leasehold improvements for impairment we made this determination as evidence of a sustained and sharp deterioration in the general business environment and specifically all of our major markets was building rapidly through the quarter several of our customers and other technology companies in the supply chain of our customers as well as our competitors reduced their financial outlook andor otherwise disclosed that they were experiencing very challenging market conditions with little visibility of a rebound in addition prior to the start of the december quarter the tam was estimated to be approximately 156 million units at about eight weeks into the quarter the outlook for the tam had decreased to be approximately 135 million units after the close of the quarter preliminary industry data indicated actual shipments for the december quarter were approximately 123 million units in response to these adverse business indicators and the rapidly declining revenue trends experienced during our fiscal second quarter we reduced our nearterm and longterm financial projections consequently we performed an analysis of goodwill for impairment and of the recoverability and impairment of other longlived assets in accordance with the guidance in financial accounting standards board fasb statement sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 142 and sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets sfas no 144 respectively based on these analyses we recorded impairment charges of 23 billion for goodwill and 3 million for other longlived assets see critical accounting policies herein for further details 

other income expense net 



the change in net other expense was primarily due to a 40 million decrease in interest income as a result of lower yields on cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments and a 38 million decline in the value of the deferred compensation plan assets the corresponding gain or loss on deferred compensation plan liabilities is primarily reported in operating expenses 

income taxes 



we recorded a provision for income taxes of 311 million for fiscal year 2009 compared to a provision for income taxes of 67 million for fiscal year 2008 we are a foreign holding company incorporated in the cayman islands with foreign and us subsidiaries that operate in multiple taxing jurisdictions as a result our worldwide operating income is either subject to varying rates of tax or is exempt from tax due to tax holidays or tax incentive programs we operate under in china malaysia singapore switzerland and thailand these tax holidays or incentives are scheduled to expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2020 

our provision for income taxes for fiscal year 2009 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying a notional us 35 rate to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i nondeductible goodwill impairments ii an increase in our valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets iii foreign losses with no tax benefit iv the tax benefit related to the aforementioned tax holidays and tax incentive programs and v tax expense related to intercompany transactions our provision for income taxes recorded for the fiscal year ended june 27 2008 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying a notional us 35 rate to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i the tax benefit related to the aforementioned tax holidays and tax incentive programs ii a decrease in our valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets and iii tax expense related to intercompany transactions 

based on our foreign ownership structure and subject to i potential future increases in our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and ii limitations imposed by internal revenue code section 382 irc section 382 on usage of certain tax attributes further described below we anticipate that our effective tax rate in future periods will generally be less than the us federal statutory rate dividend distributions received from our us subsidiaries may be subject to us withholding taxes when and if distributed deferred tax liabilities have not been recorded on unremitted earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries as these earnings will not be subject to tax in the cayman islands or us federal income tax if remitted to our foreign parent holding company 

in fiscal year 2009 the deferred tax asset valuation allowance was 1313 million the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets increased by approximately 880 million in fiscal year 2009 the increase in valuation allowance resulted primarily from the liquidation of our wholly owned subsidiary maxtor effective june 1 2009 and represents the net effects of the extinguishment of all deferred tax assets related to historical carryover tax attributes of maxtor and the increase in deferred tax assets related to losses incurred in connection with the liquidation transaction as of june 27 2008 the deferred tax asset valuation allowance was 433 million approximately 22 million of this amount relates to deferred tax assets acquired in the maxtor acquisition for which the related benefit would have been credited to goodwill if realized the net increase in the valuation allowance in fiscal year 2008 was 34 million 

at july 3 2009 we had net deferred tax assets of 469 million the realization of 416 million of these deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on our ability to generate sufficient us and certain foreign taxable income in future periods although realization is not assured we believe that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable 

however may increase or decrease when we reevaluate the underlying basis for our estimates of future us and certain foreign taxable income 

during fiscal year 2009 several enacted us tax law changes were taken into account in computing our income tax provision as follows on july 30 2008 the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 was enacted under this law we can elect to accelerate a portion of our unused amt and research tax credits in lieu of the 50percent bonus depreciation enacted in february 2008 on february 17 2009 the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 arra was enacted to extend the acceleration of amt and research credits in lieu of bonus depreciation based on qualified capital additions through the end of calendar year 2009 we have concluded that we qualify for and recorded income tax benefits of approximately 17 million related to these accelerated credits on october 3 2008 the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 was signed into law under this law the research credit was retroactively extended through december 31 2009 from december 31 2007 this extension had no immediate impact on our tax provision due to valuation allowances that were recorded for the us deferred tax assets related to these additional credits 

on january 3 2005 we underwent a change in ownership under irc section 382 due to the sale of common shares to the public by our then largest shareholder new sac the annual limitation for this change is 448 million as of july 3 2009 there were 441 million of us net operating loss carryforwards and 96 million of us tax credit carryforwards subject to irc section 382 limitation associated with the january 3 2005 change 

effective at the beginning of fiscal year 2008 we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no fin 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 48 fin 48 contains a twostep approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes sfas no 109 the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

as a result of the implementation of fin 48 we increased our liability for net unrecognized tax benefits at the date of adoption we accounted for the increase primarily as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle that resulted in a decrease to retained earnings of 3 million and an increase to goodwill of 25 million the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits as of the date of adoption was 385 million excluding interest and penalties 

as of july 3 2009 and june 27 2008 we had approximately 118 million and 374 million respectively in unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties the unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would impact the effective tax rate were 118 million and 68 million as of july 3 2009 and june 27 2008 respectively subject to certain future valuation allowances reversals as a result of the adoption of sfas no 141 revised 2007 business combinations sfas no 141r in fiscal year 2010 the amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of july 3 2009 that would impact the effective tax rate was approximately 118 million 

it is our policy to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for taxes on the consolidated statements of operations as of june 27 2008 we accrued approximately 22 million for the payment of interest and penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits the accrual decreased by 6 million to approximately 16 million as of july 3 2009 

during fiscal year 2009 our unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties decreased by approximately 256 million primarily due to i reductions associated with audit activity of 6 million ii reductions associated with the expiration of certain statutes of limitation of 23 million iii reductions associated with the maxtor liquidation transactions of 232 million iv increases in current year 

unrecognized tax benefits of 13 million and v reductions from foreign exchange gains of 8 million approximately 21 million of reduction in unrecognized tax benefits during the period was recorded as a reduction to goodwill 

during the 12 months beginning july 4 2009 we expect to reduce our unrecognized tax benefits by approximately 8 million as a result of the expiration of certain statutes of limitation we do not believe it is reasonably possible that other unrecognized tax benefits will materially change in the next 12 months however the resolution andor timing of closure on open audits are highly uncertain as to when these events occur 

we file us federal us state and foreign tax returns the internal revenue service irs is currently examining fiscal years 2005 through 2007 for state and foreign tax returns we are generally no longer subject to tax examinations for years prior to fiscal year 2001 the statute of limitation for us federal returns is open for fiscal year 2005 and forward 

fiscal year 2008 compared to fiscal year 2007 

revenue 



revenue growth in fiscal year 2008 reflected a 15 growth in the number of disk drives shipped we believe unit growth was driven by continued growth in digital content the resulting increase in demand for storage and customer acceptance of our new products industry disk drive demand across all markets grew by 18 from fiscal year 2007 with our share of the desktop and enterprise markets increasing by 5 and 6 respectively while our share of the mobile compute and consumer electronic markets declined by 6 and 10 respectively the increase in the number of units shipped and an improved mix of products shipped was partially offset by price erosion which was relatively benign during the first half of the fiscal year as a result of favorable industry conditions including wellbalanced disk drive supply and demand while being more pronounced during the second half of fiscal year 2008 as is consistent with historical seasonal patterns 

our overall asp for our products was 68 for fiscal year 2008 down from 71 in fiscal year 2007 as an improved mix of products shipped was more than offset by price erosion 

unit shipments for our products in fiscal year 2008 were as follows 

• enterprise —203 million up from 167 million units in fiscal year 2007 • mobile —267 million up from 194 million units in fiscal year 2007 • desktop —1110 million up from 978 million units in fiscal year 2007 • consumer —246 million down from 253 million units in fiscal year 2007 we maintain various sales programs such as pointofsale rebates sales price adjustments and price protection aimed at increasing customer demand we exercise judgment in formulating the underlying estimates related to distributor and retail inventory levels sales program participation and customer claims submittals in determining the provision for such programs sales programs recorded as contra revenue were approximately 9 of our gross revenue for both fiscal years 2008 and 2007 

cost of revenue 



for fiscal year 2008 cost of revenue increased due to a higher number of units shipped and a higher mix of products with higher average capacities feature sets and performance partially offset by a 10 decline in the average cost per unit the average cost per unit reduction was impacted by the more efficient utilization of our manufacturing capacity resulting from increased demand and the completed integration of maxtor transitions to more cost effective products and the elimination of lower margin maxtor designed products the lower cost per unit combined with increased number of units shipped and improved mix of higher margin products resulted in gross margin improvement which was partially offset by price erosion 

product development expense 



product development expense for fiscal year 2008 included 82 million in variable performancebased compensation compared to none in fiscal year 2007 product development expenses associated with developing alternative technologies and storage services increased by 40 million while depreciation and other research and development costs increased by approximately 29 million these increases were partially offset by a decrease of 27 million in costs associated with the maxtor acquisition 

marketing and administrative expense 



marketing and administrative expenses increased primarily due to increases of 53 million in variable performancebased compensation compared to none in fiscal year 2007 29 million in additional payroll expense resulting from increased headcount and salary increases 38 million increase in expenses related to our data storage services and 32 million in incremental legal expenses these increases were partially offset by a charge of approximately 40 million in fiscal year 2007 for the provision of doubtful accounts receivable related to esys technologies pte ltd and its related affiliate entities esys and a charge of 35 million for costs associated with the maxtor acquisition in fiscal year 2007 

amortization of intangibles 



the increase in the amortization of intangibles was due primarily to the acquisition of evault 

restructuring and other 



during fiscal year 2008 we recorded restructuring and other charges of 88 million comprised mainly of restructuring charges related to the closures of our limavady northern ireland and our milpitas california operations the restructuring charges associated with the limavady facility were primarily related to employee termination costs of approximately 29 million and approximately 18 million related to grant repayments we recorded approximately 19 million in restructuring charges associated with employee termination costs related to the closure of our media manufacturing facility in milpitas california the remaining restructuring and other charges were primarily comprised of employee termination costs as a result of plans to continue the alignment of our global workforce with existing and anticipated business requirements around the world 

net other income expense 



the change in net other expense was primarily due to the positive impacts of approximately 21 million in gains from asset sales and a 15 million decrease in interest expense due to costs related to the early redemption in fiscal year 2007 of our previously outstanding 8 senior notes due 2009 partially offset by a 16 million decrease in interest income due primarily to lower yields and the recognition of a 4 million loss related to deferred compensation plan assets compared to a gain of 19 million in the prior fiscal year the corresponding gain or loss on deferred compensation plan liabilities is offset against compensation expenses in cost of revenue and operating expenses 

income taxes 



we recorded a provision for income taxes of 67 million for fiscal year 2008 compared to a benefit from income taxes of 352 million for fiscal year 2007 we were a foreign holding company incorporated in the cayman islands with foreign and us subsidiaries that operate in multiple taxing jurisdictions as a result our worldwide operating income was either subject to varying rates of tax or was exempt from tax due to tax holidays or tax incentive programs we operated under in china malaysia singapore switzerland and thailand these tax holidays or incentives were scheduled to expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2020 

our provision for income taxes for fiscal year ended 2008 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying a notional us 35 rate to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i the tax benefit related to the aforementioned tax holidays and tax incentive programs ii a decrease in our valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets and iii tax expense related to intercompany transactions our provision for income taxes recorded for fiscal year 2007 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying a notional us 35 rate to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i a decrease in our valuation allowance for certain 

deferred tax assets and ii the tax benefit related to the aforementioned tax holidays and tax incentive programs 

based on our foreign ownership structure and subject to i potential future increases in our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and ii limitations imposed by internal revenue code section 382 irc section 382 on usage of certain tax attributes further described below we anticipate that our effective tax rate in future periods will generally be less than the us federal statutory rate dividend distributions received from our us subsidiaries may be subject to us withholding taxes when and if distributed deferred tax liabilities were not recorded on unremitted earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries as these earnings were not subject to tax in the cayman islands or us federal income tax if remitted to our foreign parent holding company 

as of june 27 2008 the deferred tax asset valuation allowance was 433 million approximately 22 million of this amount relates to deferred tax assets acquired in the maxtor acquisition for which the related benefit would have been credited to goodwill if realized the valuation allowance increased by 34 million in fiscal year 2008 and decreased by 580 million in fiscal year 2007 the fiscal year 2007 valuation allowance release was largely due to the completion during 2007 of the restructuring of our intercompany arrangements which enables us to forecast future us taxable income with greater certainty and us taxable income from the intercompany sale of certain maxtor assets 

as of june 27 2008 we had net deferred tax assets of 890 million the realization of 808 million of these deferred tax assets was primarily dependent on our ability to generate sufficient us and certain foreign taxable income in future periods although realization was not assured we believed that it was more likely than not that these deferred tax assets would be realized the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable however may increase or decrease when we reevaluate the underlying basis for our estimates of future us and certain foreign taxable income 

at june 27 2008 we had approximately 374 million in total unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties the total unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would impact the effective tax rate were 75 million and 63 million as of june 27 2008 and june 29 2007 respectively 

our policy to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for taxes on the consolidated statements of operations did not change as a result of implementing the provisions of fin 48 as of the date of adoption of fin 48 we accrued approximately 19 million for the payment of interest and penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits this accrual increased by 3 million to approximately 22 million as of june 27 2008 

during the 12 months ending june 27 2008 we recognized a previously unrecognized tax benefit of approximately 13 million related to the recognition of foreign uncertain tax benefits as a result of new information obtained during the year we also recognized a previously unrecognized tax benefit of approximately 9 million for foreign uncertain tax benefits resulting in a reduction of the maxtor goodwill as a result of the expiration of certain foreign statutes of limitation for preacquisition periods 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheet and cash flows contractual obligations and other commitments on our liquidity and capital resources 

cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and restricted cash and investments 



the increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily a result of cash provided by operating activities of 823 million and 350 million from the drawdown of our credit facility these increases were partially offset by capital expenditures of 633 million and dividend payments of 132 million 

our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase our shortterm investments consist primarily of readily marketable debt securities with remaining maturities of more than 90 days at the time of purchase as stated in our investment policy we are averse to principal loss and seek to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk we mitigate default risk by maintaining portfolio investments in diversified highquality investment grade securities with limited time to maturity we monitor our investment portfolio and position our portfolio to respond appropriately to a reduction in credit rating of any investment issuer guarantor or depository we intend to maintain a highly liquid portfolio by investing only in those marketable securities that we believe have active secondary or resale markets we believe our cash equivalents and shortterm investments are liquid and accessible we operate in some countries that may have restrictive regulations over the movement of cash andor foreign exchange across their borders these restrictions have not impeded our ability to conduct business in those countries nor do we expect them to in the next 12 months we are not aware of any downgrades losses or other significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or shortterm investments and accordingly do not believe the fair value of our shortterm investments has significantly changed from the values reported as of july 3 2009 

restricted cash consists of 380 million of proceeds from the issuance of our 10 senior secured secondpriority notes due may 2014 the 10 notes held in escrow for repayment or repurchase of debt 85 million of cash held in trust for payment of our deferred compensation plan liabilities and 43 million in cash collateral held at banks for various performance obligations 

the following table summarizes results of statement of cash flows for the periods indicated 



cash provided by operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2009 was approximately 823 million and includes the effects of a net loss adjusted for noncash items including depreciation amortization stockbased 

compensation impairment of goodwill and other longlived assets and the income tax provision related to a change in our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and 

• a decrease of 372 million in accounts receivable due to a decrease in revenue improved sales linearity and a shift in channel mix • a decrease of 358 million in inventories due to improved inventory and build schedule management and supply chain improvements and • a decrease of 296 million in accrued employee compensation primarily due to no variable performancebased compensation expense in fiscal year 2009 cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2008 was approximately 25 billion and includes the effects of our net income adjusted for noncash items including depreciation amortization and stockbased compensation and 

• an increase of 351 million in accounts payable primarily as a result of outsourcing the manufacture of certain subassemblies to third parties • an increase of 238 million in vendor nontrade receivables primarily as a result of outsourcing the manufacture of certain subassemblies to third parties see note 2 to the notes to consolidated financial statements • an increase of 151 million in inventories principally raw materials and finished goods and • an increase of 288 million in accrued expenses and employee compensation cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2007 was approximately 943 million and includes the effects of our net income adjusted for noncash items including depreciation amortization stockbased compensation and tax benefits related to a change in our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and 

• a decrease of 391 million in accounts payable • a decrease of 357 million in accrued expenses and employee compensation a majority of which was due to the fact that we did not accrue variable performancebased compensation expense in fiscal year 2007 • the payment of accrued exit costs and retention bonuses related to the maxtor acquisition and • a reduction of 106 million in inventories cash used in investing activities 

in fiscal year 2009 we made 633 million of capital investments the investments in property equipment and leasehold improvements primarily comprised of 

• 91 million for manufacturing facilities and equipment related to our subassembly and disk drive final assembly and test facilities in the far east • 168 million for upgrading and expansion of our recording media operations in malaysia and singapore • 273 million for manufacturing facilities and equipment for our recording head operations in the united states the far east and northern ireland • 48 million for facilities and equipment for alternative technologies in the united states and • 53 million for research and development equipment information technology infrastructure and other facilities and equipment 61 

for fiscal year 2010 we expect approximately 450 million of capital investments to primarily fund necessary investments in core technologies we will continue to evaluate capital investment requirements as the demand environment evolves 

during fiscal year 2008 we used 991 million for net cash investing activities which was primarily attributable to expenditures for property equipment and leasehold improvements of approximately 930 million and 74 million for the acquisition of metalincs the approximately 930 million we invested in property equipment and leasehold improvements was primarily comprised of

during fiscal year 2009 cash proceeds from financing activities were primarily attributable to 399 million in net proceeds from the issuance of our 10 senior secured secondpriority notes due may 2014 notes and 350 million drawn on our credit facility cash proceeds from financing activities were offset by 132 million in dividends paid to our shareholders and 55 million including 19 million proceeds from the issuance of our 10 notes paid to repurchase and retire our debt the remaining proceeds of 380 million from the issuance of our 10 notes are held in escrow for the repayment or repurchase of our debt 

on april 13 2009 we announced that we had adopted a policy of not paying a quarterly dividend 

net cash used in financing activities of approximately 15 billion for fiscal year 2008 was primarily attributable to the repurchases of our common shares totaling 15 billion additionally we paid approximately 216 million in dividends to our shareholders repaid 34 million of our longterm debt and received approximately 178 million in cash from employee stock option exercises and employee stock purchases 

net cash used in financing activities of 463 million for fiscal year 2007 was primarily attributable to approximately 15 billion used for the repurchases of our common shares 416 million used in the redemption of our 8 notes and 212 million of dividends paid to our shareholders largely offset by approximately 15 billion received from the issuance of longterm debt and 219 million cash provided by employee stock option exercises and employee stock purchases 

liquidity sources cash requirements and commitments 

our primary sources of liquidity as of july 3 2009 consisted of 1 approximately 15 billion in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments 2 cash we expect to generate from operations and 3 a 350 million credit facility which is committed until 2011 but is currently fully drawn we also have restricted cash and investments that include 380 million held in escrow available for the retirement of debt and 85 million available for the payment of employee deferred compensation liabilities 

our liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital research and development and capital expenditure needs and to service our debt our ability to fund these requirements and comply with the financial covenants under our debt agreements will depend on our future operations performance and cash flow and is subject to prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and financial business and other factors some of which are beyond our control we believe that our sources of cash will be sufficient to fund our operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months 

the carrying value of debt as of july 3 2009 and june 27 2008 was 2727 million and 2030 million respectively the table below presents the principal amounts of our outstanding debt in order of maturity 



on april 3 2009 we amended the credit agreement governing our credit facility in order to relax certain financial covenants under the credit agreement the amendment also reduced the facility size from 500 million to 350 million the facility size may be further reduced from 350 million by cash proceeds from certain transactions over specified amounts including certain asset sales and debt and equity issuances which would require us to concurrently reduce our borrowings under the credit facility by such amounts to comply with the reduction in commitments the amendment also increased the interest rate margin applicable on all funded loans under the credit facility to a rate of libor plus 350 basis points 

the 350 million outstanding under the credit facility prior to the amendment remains outstanding under the amended credit facility which continues to mature in september 2011 the obligations under 

the credit facility will continue to be guaranteed by us and will be additionally guaranteed by certain of our material subsidiaries and secured by a lien on substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets 

the credit facility has various limitations on certain transactions that may occur including limitations on asset sales liens incurrence of additional debt issuance of preferred stock redemption and repurchases of debt or stock and payment of dividends 

the amended credit facility also contains three financial covenants 

• minimum liquidity prior to january 1 2010 we must maintain a minimum amount of liquidity in the form of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 600 million including any cash drawn under the credit facility after january 1 2010 we must maintain a minimum amount of liquidity in the form of cash cash equivalents and short term investments of 500 million excluding any cash drawn under the credit facility • fixed charge coverage ratio we must maintain a fixed charge ratio of at least 150 • net leverage ratio we must not exceed a net leverage ratio of 180x for the quarter ended july 3 2009 265x for the quarter ended october 2 2009 180x for the quarter ended january 1 2010 and 150x for any subsequent quarter by holding proceeds of our 10 notes in escrow until no later than november 1 2009 the notes are considered refinancing of existing debt as opposed to incremental debt for the purpose of calculating our net leverage ratio as of july 3 2009 we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our credit facility based on our current outlook we expect to be in compliance with these covenants over the next 12 months 

on may 1 2009 our subsidiary seagate technology international completed the sale of 430 million aggregate principal amount of 10 senior secured secondpriority notes due may 2014 the 10 notes in a private placement exempt from the registration requirements of the securities act of 1933 as amended the obligations under the 10 notes are unconditionally guaranteed by us and certain of our material subsidiaries and are secured by a secondpriority lien on substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets the indenture of the 10 notes contains covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries subject to certain exceptions to incur additional debt or issue certain preferred stock create liens pay dividends redeem or repurchase debt or stock sell certain assets issue or sell capital stock of certain subsidiaries and enter into certain transactions with our stockholders or affiliates the net proceeds from the offering of the notes were approximately 399 million which we intend to use for general corporate purposes including the repayment or repurchase of all or some of the 300 million aggregate principal amount of our floating rate senior notes due october 1 2009 and other indebtedness 

we require substantial amounts of cash to fund scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness future capital expenditures and any increased working capital requirements included in the current portion of longterm debt on our consolidated balance sheet as of july 3 2009 are 300 million floating rate senior notes due october 1 2009 and 116 million 68 convertible senior notes due april 30 2010 

the 2375 convertible senior notes due august 2012 the 2375 notes of which 326 million were outstanding as of july 3 2009 contain a cash conversion feature that will require us to deliver to the holders upon any conversion of these notes cash in an amount equal to the lesser of a the principal amount of the notes converted and b the asconverted value of the notes we will also be required to deliver an additional amount equal to the difference between the asconverted value of the notes and the principal amount in either cash or stock at our election to the extent holders of the notes choose to convert their notes seagate may require additional amounts of cash to meet this obligation as of july 3 2009 the 2375 notes did not meet the conditions for conversion 

we expect to pay cash restructuring charges aggregating approximately 70 million in the next 12 months primarily related to the restructuring plans announced in january and may 2009 additionally in the next 12 months we expect to pay an estimated 10 million in cash restructuring charges related to the recent announcement of the closure of our ang mo kio facility in singapore 

during fiscal year 2009 we did not repurchase any of our common shares as of july 3 2009 we had authorization to repurchase approximately 20 billion our common shares remaining under the february 2008 stock repurchase plan which expires february 2010 see part ii item 5 market for registrants common shares related shareholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities—repurchases of our equity securities 

we continue to evaluate various financing options to manage the retirement and replacement of existing debt and associated obligations including the issuance of new debt securities exchanging existing debt securities for other debt securities and retiring debt pursuant to privately negotiated transactions open market purchases or otherwise in addition we may selectively pursue strategic alliances acquisitions and investments any material future acquisitions alliances or investments will likely require additional capital 

contractual obligations and commitments 

our contractual cash obligations and commitments as of july 3 2009 have been summarized in the table below 



1 included in debt for fiscal year 2013 is the principal amount of 326 million related to our 2375 notes which is payable upon the conversion of the 2375 notes the 2375 notes are currently nonconvertible as our shares traded below 110 of the conversion price for at least 20 consecutive trading days of the last 30 trading days of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 as a result the 2375 notes are classified as longterm debt on our consolidated balance sheet at july 3 2009 also includes a shortterm borrowing of 350 million on the corporate credit facility which is due within the year although the facility is committed until fiscal 2012 2 includes total future minimum rent expense under noncancelable leases for both occupied and vacated facilities rent expense is shown net of sublease income 3 purchase obligations are defined as contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services which are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms 65 

as of july 3 2009 we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits and an accrual for the payment of related interest totaling 69 million none of which is expected to be paid within one year we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlement with a taxing authority will occur 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of july 3 2009 we did not have any material offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of regulation sk 

critical accounting policies 

the methods estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements the sec has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are highly uncertain at the time of estimation based on this definition our most critical policies include establishment of sales program accruals establishment of warranty accruals accounting for income taxes and the valuation of intangibles and goodwill below we discuss these policies further as well as the estimates and judgments involved we also have other key accounting policies and accounting estimates relating to uncollectible customer accounts valuation of inventory valuation of sharebased payments and acquisition related restructuring we believe that these other accounting policies and accounting estimates either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective or it is less likely that they would have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period 

establishment of sales program accruals we establish certain distributor and oem sales programs aimed at increasing customer demand for the distribution channel these programs typically involve rebates related to a distributors level of sales order size advertising or point of sale activity and price protection adjustments for oem sales rebates are typically based on an oem customers volume of purchases from seagate or other agreed upon rebate programs we provide for these obligations at the time that revenue is recorded based on estimated requirements we estimate these contrarevenue rebates and adjustments based on various factors including price reductions during the period reported estimated future price erosion customer orders distributor sellthrough and inventory levels program participation customer claim submittals and sales returns our estimates reflect contractual arrangements but also our judgment relating to variables such as customer claim rates and attainment of program goals and inventory and sellthrough levels reported by our distribution customers 

while we believe we have sufficient experience and knowledge of the market and customer buying patterns to reasonably estimate such rebates and adjustments actual market conditions or customer behavior could differ from our expectations as a result actual payments under these programs which may spread over several months after the related sale may vary from the amount accrued accordingly revenues and margins in the period in which the adjustment occurs may be affected for example if the pricing environment is more competitive than we anticipated accruals for forward price protection rebates may be inadequate in addition during periods in which our distributors inventories of our products are at higher than historical levels our contrarevenue estimates are subject to a greater degree of subjectivity and the potential for actual results to vary is accordingly higher currently our distributors inventories are at the low end of the historical range 

significant actual variations in any of the factors upon which we base our contrarevenue estimates could have a material effect on our operating results since fiscal year 2007 total sales programs have ranged from 9 to 12 of gross revenues due to the competitive pricing environment in our industry sales programs as a percentage of gross revenue may increase from the current range if such rebates and incentives trend upwards revenues and margins will be reduced adjustments to revenues due to under or 

over accruals for sales programs related to revenues reported in prior quarterly periods have averaged 05 of quarterly gross revenue for fiscal years 2007 through 2009 

establishment of warranty accruals we estimate probable product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized we generally warrant our products for a period of one to five years our warranty provision considers estimated product failure rates and trends including the timing of product returns during the warranty periods estimated repair or replacement costs and estimated costs for customer compensatory claims related to product quality issues if any we use a statistical model to help with our estimates and we exercise considerable judgment in determining the underlying estimates should actual experience in any future period differ significantly from our estimates or should the rate of future product technological advancements fail to keep pace with the past our future results of operations could be materially affected our judgment is subject to a greater degree of subjectivity with respect to newly introduced products and legacy maxtor designed products because of limited experience with those products upon which to base our warranty estimates 

the actual results with regard to warranty expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations if the actual rate of unit failure the cost to repair a unit or the actual cost required to satisfy customer compensatory claims are greater than that which we have used in estimating the warranty accrual since we typically outsource our warranty repairs our repair cost is subject to periodic negotiations with vendors and may vary from our estimates we also exercise judgment in estimating our ability to sell certain repaired disk drives to the extent such sales fall below our forecast warranty cost will be adversely impacted 

our warranty cost has ranged from approximately 2 to 25 of revenue over the last three years we review our warranty accrual quarterly for products shipped in prior periods and which are still under warranty any changes in the estimates underlying the accrual may result in adjustments that will impact the current period gross margins and income since fiscal year 2007 changes in estimates of prior warranty accruals have approximated 05 or less of revenue changes in anticipated failure rates of specific products and significant changes in repair or replacement costs have historically been the major reasons for significant changes in prior estimates 

income taxes we account for income taxes pursuant to sfas no 109 and related pronouncements in applying sfas no 109 we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits recognition of income and deductions and calculation of specific tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions the calculation of tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the internal revenue service or other tax jurisdiction if estimates of these tax liabilities are greater or less than actual results an additional tax benefit or provision will result the deferred tax assets we record each period depend primarily on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions each period we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and if necessary we adjust the valuation allowance so that net deferred tax assets are recorded only to the extent we conclude it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized if our outlook for future taxable income changes significantly our assessment of the need for a valuation allowance may also change 

as a result of adverse changes in the outlook for our future us taxable income we completed a reassessment of our valuation allowance against us deferred tax assets in the december 2008 quarter we increased the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 

impairment of goodwill and other longlived assets we account for goodwill in accordance with sfas no 142 as required by sfas no 142 we test goodwill of our reporting units annually during our 

fourth quarter or whenever events occur or circumstances change such as an adverse change in business climate or a decline in the overall industry that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount we test other longlived assets including property equipment and leasehold improvements and other intangible assets subject to amortization for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 144 

testing goodwill for impairment requires a twostep approach under sfas no 142 in determining the fair value of our reporting units in step one of our sfas no 142 impairment analysis we use one or both of these commonly accepted valuation methodologies 1 the income approach which is based on the present value of discounted cash flows and terminal value projected for the reporting unit and 2 the market approach which estimates fair value based on appropriate valuation multiples of revenue or earnings derived from comparable companies adjusted by an estimated control premium the estimated control premium is based on reviewing observable transactions involving controlling interests in comparable companies the discount rate that we use in the income approach of valuation represents the weighted average cost of capital that we believe is reflective of the relevant risk associated with the projected cash flows we may use a weighted average of the fair values determined separately using the income and market approaches if we determine that this will provide a more appropriate estimated fair value of the reporting units 

to validate the reasonableness of the reporting unit fair values we reconcile the aggregate fair values of the reporting units determined in step one as described above to the enterprise market capitalization to derive the implied control premium we compare the implied control premium to premiums paid in observable recent transactions of comparable companies to determine if the fair values of the reporting units estimated in step one are reasonable 

in accordance with the guidance in sfas no 142 we have determined that we have two reporting units to which goodwill is assignable the hard disk drive reporting unit and the services reporting unit each of these reporting units constitutes a business and is the lowest level for which discrete financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by management the acquired businesses underlying our goodwill are specific to either the hard disk drive or the services reporting units and the goodwill amounts are assigned as such the services reporting unit represents approximately 1 of our revenues and total assets 

if step one of the sfas no 142 analysis demonstrates that the fair value of either reporting unit is below the carrying value we will proceed to step two of sfas no 142 if step two is necessary we will estimate the fair values of all identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit using the income market or replacement cost approaches as appropriate the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair values of the identified assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill if the fair value of goodwill is lower than the carrying value of the goodwill an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value to fair value 

in accordance with sfas no 144 we test other longlived assets including property equipment and leasehold improvements and other intangible assets subject to amortization for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value s of those assets of those assets may not be recoverable we assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using the same approaches indicated above for sfas no 142 step two and compare it to its carrying value the excess of the carrying value over the fair value is allocated pro rata to derive the adjusted carrying value of each asset in the asset group the adjusted carrying value of each asset in the asset group is not reduced below its fair value 

the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill or other longlived assets is subjective and requires us to make significant judgments at many points during the analysis in estimating the fair value of the reporting units for the goodwill impairment analysis we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of a reporting unit from a market participant perspective during a period of reduced market visibility and increased uncertainty such as the current environment the difficulty of estimating future cash flows is increased this also applies to the estimation of cash flows expected to be generated from an asset or asset group tested for recoverability under sfas no 144 we exercise significant judgment in determining among other things the appropriate discount rate to be used in discounting the projected cash flows and terminal value in the income approach of valuation the appropriate comparables for arriving at valuation multiples and the appropriate control premiums to apply in the market approach of valuation remaining economic lives of certain assets or obsolescence adjustments in applying the replacement cost approach 

in performing the reconciliation of aggregate fair values of reporting units to our enterprise market capitalization we exercise judgment in determining whether a single stock price at the valuation date or an average of the stock prices over a reasonable range of dates around the valuation date is appropriate given the recent volatility in the capital markets we decided that for the january 2 interim review it was appropriate to use the average market capitalization over a range of 15 days extending before and after the valuation date 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 1 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our financial statements 

item 7a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 

we have exposure to market risks due to the volatility of interest rates foreign currency exchange rates equity and bond markets a portion of these risks are hedged but fluctuations could impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows additionally we have exposure to downgrades in the credit ratings of our counterparties as well as exposure related to our credit rating changes 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our credit facility at july 3 2009 we had no marketable securities that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for a period greater than 12 months and determined that no investments were otherthantemporarily impaired we currently do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 

we have exposure to counterparty credit downgrades in the form of credit risk related to our accounts receivable balances our foreign currency forward exchange contracts and our fixed income portfolio we monitor and limit our credit exposure for both our accounts receivable balances and our foreign currency forward exchange contracts by performing ongoing credit evaluations we also manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with any one counterparty and we maintain limits on maximum tenor of contracts based on the credit rating of the financial institutions additionally the investment portfolio is diversified and structured to minimize credit risk as of july 3 2009 we had counterparty credit exposure of 14 million comprised of the marktomarket valuation related to our foreign currency forward exchange contracts in a gain position changes in our corporate issuer credit ratings have minimal impact on our financial results but downgrades may negatively impact our future transaction costs and our ability to execute transactions with various counterparties 

we have exposure to equity market risks due to changes in the fair value of the notional investments selected by our employees as part of our nonqualified deferred compensation nqdc plan in the quarter ended july 3 2009 we entered into a total return swap trs in order to manage the equity market risks associated with the nqdc plan liabilities we pay a floating rate based on libor plus a 

spread on the notional amount of the trs the trs is designed to substantially offset changes in the nqdc plan liability due to changes in the value of the investment options made by employees the contract term of the trs is one year and is settled on a monthly basis therefore limiting counterparty performance risk the terms of the trs required us to pledge initial collateral of 18 million to the counterparty for the term of the contract additional collateral may be posted contingent on the counterpartys exposure to the market value of the trs as of july 3 2009 we had pledged the initial 18 million to the counterparty and recorded the cash pledged as restricted cash 

during fiscal year 2009 we sold auction rate securities with a par value of 10 million as of july 3 2009 we continued to hold auction rate securities with a par value of approximately 21 million all of which are collateralized by student loans guaranteed by the federal family education loan program beginning in the march 2008 quarter these securities have continuously failed to settle at auction as of july 3 2009 the estimated fair value of these auction rate securities was 18 million we believe that the impairments totaling 3 million are temporary given our ability and intent to hold these securities until liquidity returns to this market or until maturity of these securities as such the impairment was recorded in other comprehensive income loss and these securities were classified as longterm investments 

we have both fixed and variable rate debt obligations we enter into debt obligations to support general corporate purposes including capital expenditures and working capital needs we currently do not use interest rate derivatives to hedge interest rate exposure on our outstanding debt 

the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio and debt obligations as of july 3 2009 all shortterm investments mature in three years or less longterm debt due in fiscal year 2013 includes the principal amount of 326 million related to our 2375 notes which may be payable earlier if converted effective october 4 2008 the 2375 notes became nonconvertible and were reclassified to longterm debt as of july 3 2009 the 2375 notes remained nonconvertible as our shares traded below 110 of the conversion price for at least 20 consecutive trading days of the last 30 trading days of the quarter in addition the payments of dividends to holders of our common shares have in certain quarters resulted in upward adjustments to the conversion rate of the 2375 notes

foreign currency exchange risk we monitor our foreign currency exposures regularly to ensure the effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions we recognize all of our derivative financial 

instruments principally foreign currency forward exchange contracts on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities and these derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value 

we may enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposure related to certain foreign currency commitments foreign currency denominated balance sheet positions and anticipated foreign currency denominated expenditures our policy prohibits us from entering into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes during the fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 we did not enter into any hedges of net investments in foreign operations 

we transact business in various foreign countries our primary foreign currency cash flows are in countries where we have a manufacturing presence we have established a foreign currency hedging program to protect against the increase in value of foreign currency cash flows resulting from operating and capital expenditures over the next year we hedge portions of our forecasted expenses denominated in foreign currencies with forward exchange contracts when the us dollar weakens significantly against the foreign currencies the increase in the value of the future foreign currency expenditure is offset by gains in the value of the forward contracts designated as hedges conversely as the us dollar strengthens the decrease in value of the future foreign currency cash flows is offset by losses in the value of the forward contracts these foreign currency forward exchange contracts carried at fair value may have maturities of up to 12 months 

for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges we initially record the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative in other comprehensive income loss and the ineffective portion is reported in earnings amounts in other comprehensive income loss are reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings 

we also hedge a portion of our foreign currency denominated balance sheet positions with foreign currency forward exchange contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings will be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates the changes in fair value of these hedges are recognized in earnings in the same period as the gains and losses from the remeasurement of the assets and liabilities these foreign currency forward exchange contracts are not designated as hedging instruments under sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 

we evaluate hedging effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively and record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in other income expense on the statement of operations we did not have any net gains losses recognized in other income expense for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness during fiscal year 2009 nor did we discontinue any material cash flow hedges for a forecasted transaction in fiscal year 2009

storage services  an emerging area within the electronic data storage industry is services and solutions related to the backup archiving recovery and discovery of electronic data 

  

demand for electronic data storage 

  

the electronic data storage industry has traditionally been focused on compute applications for the enterprise market we believe that technological advances in storage technology and a proliferation of noncompute applications in the consumer electronics market such as digital video recorders dvrs gaming devices digital music players and digital cameras is increasingly driving the broad global proliferation of digital content through the 

  

   

   

   

   

   

we believe that growth in digital content is being driven by mediarich content such as high definition video digital photos movies and music an increase in user generated content such as online video sharing blogging and podcasting the digitization of content previously stored in analog format such as paper filing systems the duplication of content in multiple locations including consumers’ replication of digital photos video and other media as a result of these factors the nature and amount of content being created requires increasingly higher storage capacity in order to store manage distribute utilize and back up such content this in turn has resulted in the rapid growth in demand for electronic data storage applications and solutions 

  

we believe that demand for electronic data storage in the enterprise and traditional compute markets continues to grow as increasing legal and regulatory requirements and changes in the nature and amount of data being stored has necessitated additional storage additionally the proliferation of digital content in the consumer space has resulted in additional demand for storage by enterprises including those that host aggregate distribute or share such content 

  

demand for disc drives 

  

while the disc drive industry has traditionally been focused on applications for the enterprise and compute markets we believe advances in disc drive capacity cost per gigabyte power and ruggedness have enabled growth in demand for digital content these technological advances as well as a proliferation of noncompute applications in the consumer electronics market has increased the demand for disc drives used in consumer electronics applications or has indirectly driven the demand for additional disc drives to store host or back up related media content created by such applications 

  

disc drives are presently the most common storage solution in enterprise desktop mobile and higher capacity consumer electronics applications we are particularly focused on the following areas of growing demand for disc drives 

  

disc drives for mobile computing the mobile computing market is growing faster than the market for desktop computers as price and performance continue to improve notebook systems are increasingly becoming the preference for both consumers and enterprises as the need for mobility increases and wireless adoption continues to advance we estimate that in fiscal year 2008 industry disc drive shipments for mobile compute applications grew approximately 45 from fiscal year 2007 

  

the disc drive industry has recently seen the introduction of alternative technologies that directly compete with mobile disc drives for example certain manufacturers have introduced ssds using flash memory technology which is an alternative to disc drives in certain applications due to the high capital requirements and capacity required to manufacture flash memory we believe the perceived benefits of ssds are not currently realized at an attractive cost relative to hard disc drives particularly in higher capacity applications we believe that the market for these alternative technologies is still developing and because of the current high cost per gigabyte of these storage solutions we do not expect these solutions to have a significant nearterm impact on the overall market for disc drives for mobile computing 

  

disc drives for enterprise storage the need to address the expansion in data storage management requirements has spurred the evolution of new storage and data management technologies for both mission critical and business critical enterprise storage 

  

mission critical enterprise storage is defined by the use of high performance high capacity disc drives for use in applications which are vital to the operation of enterprises we expect the market for mission critical enterprise storage solutions to grow driven by many enterprises continuing to move network traffic to dedicated storage area networks sans in addition many enterprises are moving away from the use of serverattached storage to networkattached storage nas both of these solutions are comprised principally of high performance high capacity disc drives with sophisticated software and communications technologies in addition many enterprises are also consolidating data centers aiming to increase speed and reliability within a smaller space reducing network complexity and increasing energy savings which has led to an increased demand for more energy efficient small form factor disc drives ssd storage applications have been introduced as a potential alternative to redundant system startup or boot disc drives in addition enterprises are considering the use of ssds in applications where rapid processing is required for high volume transaction data the timing of the adoption of ssds in these applications is currently unknown as enterprises weigh the cost benefits of mission critical enterprise disc drives relative to the perceived performance benefits of ssds 

  

business critical enterprise storage is an emerging and growing application in enterprise storage whereby enterprises are using higher capacity disc drives to store less frequently accessed less timecritical but capacityintensive data because of recent decreases in cost per gigabyte business critical electronic data which historically has been stored on tape or other backup and archival technologies are now being stored on these high capacity disc drives in the longterm however we believe that this trend towards business critical systems that utilize high capacity enterprise class serial advanced technology architecture sata and serial attached small computer system interface sas will in addition to expanding the overall enterprise market likely shift some demand from disc drives used in traditional mission critical enterprise storage 

  

disc drives for branded solutions  we believe that the proliferation of mediarich digital content has increased consumer demand for storage to augment their current desktop or notebook disc drive capacities consumers are also using external branded storage solutions to backup and secure data in case of disaster or system failure 

  

disc drives for desktop computing we believe growth in disc drives for desktop computing has recently moderated in part due to the growth in demand for notebook computers particularly in developed countries we believe that current growth in demand for disc drives in desktop computing is focused on developing markets where price remains a primary consideration demand for inexpensive high capacity external storage has also driven growth of 35inch desktop disc drives 

  

disc drives for consumer electronics disc drives in the consumer electronics markets are primarily used in highcapacity solutions such as dvrs that require more storage capability than can be provided in a costeffective manner through alternative technologies such as flash memory which is used in lower capacity consumer electronics applications we believe the demand for disc drives in consumer electronics will become more pronounced with the increased amount of high definition content that requires larger amounts of storage capacity although solid state or flash memory has largely replaced disc drives in handheld applications we believe that the demand for disc drives to store hold or back up related media content from such handheld devices continues to grow 

  

success in the disc drive industry depends on technology and manufacturing leadership high levels of capital and research and development investments and large scale operations 

  

the design and manufacturing of disc drives depends on highly advanced technology and manufacturing techniques especially in the areas of readwrite heads and recording media thereby requiring high levels of capital and significant research and development investments disc drive manufacturers are distinguished by their level of vertical integration which is the degree to which they control the technology used in their products and by whether they are captive producing disc drives for their own computer systems or independent producing disc drives as a standalone product integrated manufacturers are companies that design and produce the critical technologies including readwrite heads and recording media used in their disc drives an integrated approach enables them to lower manufacturing costs and to improve the functionality of components so that they work together efficiently in contrast manufacturers that are not integrated purchase most of their components from thirdparty suppliers upon whom they depend for key elements of their technological innovation and differentiation this can limit their ability to coordinate technology roadmaps and optimize the component design process for manufacturing efficiency and product reliability while making them reliant on the technology investment decisions of their suppliers independent manufacturers can enjoy a competitive advantage over captive manufacturers in working with oems because they do not compete with oems for computer system sales we believe the competitive dynamics of the disc drive industry favor integrated independent manufacturers with the scale to make substantial technology investments and apply them across a broad product portfolio and set of customers 

  

due to the significant challenges posed by the need to continually innovate and improve manufacturing efficiency and because of the increasing amounts of capital and research and development investments required the disc drive industry has undergone significant consolidation as disc drive manufacturers and component manufacturers merged with other companies or exited the industry through such combinations disc drive manufacturers have also become increasingly vertically integrated while recent combinations have limited the opportunity for additional industry consolidation the increasing technological challenges associated levels of investment and competitive necessity of largescale operations may still drive future industry consolidation 

  

disc drive technology 

  

overview 

  

all of our disc drive products incorporate certain components including a head disc assembly and a printed circuit board which are sealed inside a rigid base and top cover containing these components in a contamination controlled environment 

  

the head disc assembly consists of one or more discs attached to a spindle assembly powered by a spindle motor that rotates the discs at a high constant speed around a hub the discs or recording media are the components on which data is stored and from which it is retrieved each disc typically consists of a substrate of finely machined aluminum or glass with a layer of a thinfilm magnetic material readwrite heads mounted on an arm assembly similar in concept to that of a record player fly extremely close to each disc surface and record data on and retrieve it from concentric tracks in the magnetic layers of the rotating discs the readwrite heads are mounted vertically on an eshaped assembly the eblock and the recording media are mounted inside a metal casing called the base casing 

  

the printed circuit board contains standard and custom application specific integrated circuits asics and ancillary electronic control chips asics move data to and from the readwrite head and the internal controller or interface which communicates with the host computer the asics and control chips form an electronic circuitry that delivers instructions to a head positioning mechanism called an actuator to guide the heads to the selected track of a disc where the data is recorded or retrieved disc drive manufacturers typically use one or more of several industry standard interfaces such as advanced technology architecture ata sata which provides higher data transfer rates than the previous ata standard small computer system interface scsi sas and fibre channel 

  

disc drive performance 

  

disc drive performance is commonly differentiated by six key characteristics 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

areal density 

  

areal density is a measure of storage capacity per square inch on the recording surface of a disc current areal densities are sufficient to meet the requirements of most applications today the capacity of a disc drive is determined by the number of discs it contains as well as the areal density of these discs we expect the longterm demand for increased disc drive capacities will continue to grow proportionately with the shift in storage applications from predominantly compute applications to more mediarich content in particular audio video and photo storage data continue to increase in size with high definition video content an example of data requiring many multiples of the storage capacity of standard video we believe that demand will further intensify by the proliferation of these forms of content we have pursued and expect to continue to pursue a number of technologies to increase areal densities across the entire range of our products to increase disc drive capacities allowing us to use fewer discs per disc drive and potentially reduce product costs overtime 

  

manufacturing 

  

we pursue a vertically integrated business strategy based on the ownership of critical component technologies allowing us to maintain control over our product roadmap and component cost quality and availability we believe that because of our vertical design and manufacturing strategy we are well suited to 

  

meet the challenges posed by the close interdependence of components for disc drives our manufacturing efficiency and flexibility are critical elements of our integrated business strategy we continuously seek to improve our manufacturing efficiency and cost by 

  

   

   

   

   

   

manufacturing our disc drives is a complex process that begins with the production of individual components and ends with a fully assembled unit we design fabricate andor assemble a number of the most important components found in our disc drives including readwrite heads and recording media our design and manufacturing operations are based on technology platforms that are used to produce various disc drive products that serve multiple disc drive applications and markets as an example our 35inch sata disc drive with perpendicular recording technology platform is sold to customers for use in desktop enterprise and consumer electronics applications our main technology platforms are primarily focused around areal density of media and readwrite head technologies our integrated platform technologies and manufacturing allow our set of disc drive products to be used in a wide range of electronic data storage applications and in a wide range of industries 

  

readwrite heads the function of the readwrite head is to scan across the disc as it spins magnetically recording or reading information the tolerances of recording heads are extremely demanding and require stateoftheart equipment and processes our readwrite heads are manufactured with thinfilm and photolithographic processes similar to those used to produce semiconductor integrated circuits though challenges in magnetic film properties and topographical structures are unique to the disc drive industry beginning with six and eightinch round ceramic wafers we process more than 30000 head elements at one time each of these head elements goes through more than 500 steps all in clean room environments we have upgraded our fabrication facilities in capital equipment and systems to deliver the required complexity and precision needed to complete our product transition to perpendicular recording technology which we achieved during fiscal year 2008 additional capital investments will be driven primarily by volume we perform all primary stages of design and manufacture of readwrite heads at our facilities we currently manufacture all of our readwrite heads we are currently evaluating third party readwrite head for use in future products 

  

recording heads and media the percentage of our requirements for recording media that we produce internally varies from quarter to quarter our longterm strategy is to externally purchase approximately 10 of total recording media requirements in july 2008 we announced the proposed closure of our recording media manufacturing facility in milpitas california the closure is part of our ongoing focus on costefficiencies in all areas of our business we plan to cease production at the milpitas manufacturing facility in october 2008 we are continuing to expand our recording media production facilities in singapore we expect meaningful output from our new media facility in singapore beginning the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 and we believe we will have adequate internal and external supply plans in place to support our requirements similar to our longterm strategy on recording media supply our future plans include the evaluation and external purchase of approximately 10 of recording heads requirements 

  

we purchase all of our glass substrates from third parties mainly in japan which are used to manufacture our disc drives for mobile and small form factor consumer electronics products historically we purchase approximately 70 of our aluminum substrates for recording media production from third parties in december 2007 we announced the proposed closure of our substrate manufacturing facility in limavady northern ireland 

  

the proposed closure is part of our ongoing focus on costefficiencies in all areas of our business we plan to cease production at our limavady facility during the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 we are in the process of adding an aluminum substrate manufacturing facility in johor malaysia which will allow us to be more cost competitive and position us for future expansion and reduce our external substrate purchases to approximately 50 we expect meaningful output from our johor facility in during the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 

  

commodity and other manufacturing costs the production of disc drives requires precious metals scarce alloys and industrial commodities that are subject to fluctuations in prices and the supply of which has at times been constrained recent increases in the price of many commodities have resulted in higher material costs for our products additionally adverse economic conditions such as rising fuel costs may further increase our costs related to commodities manufacturing and freight should we not be able to pass these increased costs onto our customers our gross margins may be impacted 

  

in order to mitigate susceptibility to these conditions we may maintain increased inventory of precious metals scarce alloys and industrial commodities in addition we have increased our use of ocean shipments to help offset the increase in freight costs 

  

printed circuit boards printed circuit boards are the boards that contain the electronic circuitry and asics that provide the electronic controls of the disc drive and on which the headdisc assembly is mounted during fiscal year 2008 we completed the outsourcing of the manufacture and assembly of the printed circuit boards used in our disc drives to third parties 

  

spindle motors we participate in the design of many of our spindle motors and purchase them principally from outside vendors in asia whom we have licensed to use our intellectual property and technology 

  

asics we participate in the design of many of the asics used in our disc drives for motor and actuator control such as interface controllers readwrite channels and preamplifiers we do not manufacture any asics but rather buy them from thirdparty suppliers 

  

disc drive assembly following the production of the individual components of the disc drive the first step in the manufacture of a disc drive itself is the assembly of the actuator arm readwrite heads discs and spindle motor in a housing to form the headdisc assembly the production of the headdisc assembly involves largely automated processes printed circuit boards are then mated to the headdisc assembly and the completed unit is tested prior to packaging and shipment disc drive assembly and test operations occur primarily at facilities located in china singapore and thailand we perform subassembly and component manufacturing operations at our facilities in china malaysia northern ireland singapore thailand and in the united states in california and minnesota in addition third parties manufacture and assemble components for us in various asian countries including china japan korea malaysia the philippines singapore taiwan thailand and vietnam in europe and the united states

customers 

  

we sell our disc drive products primarily to major oems and distributors oem customers either themselves or through their contract manufacturers incorporate our disc drives into computer systems and storage systems for resale distributors typically sell our disc drives to small oems dealers system integrators and other resellers shipments to oems were approximately 67 64 and 72 of our disc drive revenue in fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively shipments to distributors were approximately 26 30 and 25 of our disc drive revenue in fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the only customer exceeding 10 of our disc drive revenue for fiscal years 2006 through 2008 was hp dell exceeded 10 of our disc drive revenue in fiscal years 2008 and 2006 sales to hp accounted for approximately 16 16 and 17 of our disc drive revenue in fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively sales to dell as a percentage of our disc drive revenue were 11 9 and 11 in fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively no other customer accounted for 10 or more of our disc drive revenue in fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 retail sales of our branded storage products in fiscal year 2008 as a percentage of our disc drive revenue increased to 7 from 6 and 3 in fiscal years 2007 and 2006 respectively see “item 1a risk factors—risks related to our business—dependence on key customers—we may be adversely affected by the loss of or reduced delayed or cancelled purchases by one or more of our larger customers” 

  

oem customers typically enter into master purchase agreements with us these agreements provide for pricing volume discounts order lead times product support obligations and other terms and conditions the term of these agreements is usually 12 to 36 months although our product support obligations generally extend substantially beyond this period these master agreements typically do not commit the customer to buy any minimum quantity of products or create exclusive relationships deliveries are scheduled only after receipt of purchase orders in addition with limited leadtime customers may cancel or defer most purchase orders without significant penalty anticipated orders from many of our customers have in the past failed to materialize or oem delivery schedules have been deferred or altered as a result of changes in their business needs 

  

our distributors generally enter into nonexclusive agreements for the resale of our products they typically furnish us with a nonbinding indication of their nearterm requirements and product deliveries are generally scheduled accordingly the agreements and related sales programs typically provide the distributors with limited right of return and price protection rights in addition we offer sales programs to distributors on a quarterly and periodic basis to promote the sale of selected products in the sales channel 

  

we have increased our sales of branded storage products to retail customers in the last two years further expanding our retail customer base our branded storage product is sold to retailers either by us directly or by our distributors retail sales made by us or our distributors typically require greater marketing support sales incentives and price protection periods 

  

we also regularly enter into agreements with our customers which obligate us to provide a limited indemnity against losses resulting from intellectual property claims these agreements are customary in our industry and typically require us to indemnify our customers against certain damages and costs incurred as a result of third party intellectual property claims arising as a result of their use of our products 

  

sales marketing and customer service 

  

our marketing organization works to increase demand for our disc drive products through strategic collaboration with key oem customers and distribution partners to align our respective product roadmaps and to 

  

build our brand and endcustomer relationships as customers and markets increasingly demand a broad variety of products with different performance and cost attributes we have marketing groups focused on the strategic needs of our increasingly diverse customer base we believe this enables us to serve both our core markets and better identify develop and serve emerging markets 

  

our sales organization focuses on deepening our relationship with our customers the worldwide sales group focuses on geographic coverage of oems and distributors throughout most of the world the worldwide sales group is organized by customer type and regionally among americas japan asiapacific excluding japan and europe africa and the middle east in addition we have a sales operation group which focuses on aligning our production levels with customers’ product requirements our sales force works directly with our marketing organization to coordinate our oem and distribution channel relationships we maintain sales offices throughout the united states and in australia china france germany japan singapore taiwan and the united kingdom 

  

with the acquisition of maxtor we acquired the right to the use the maxtor and other related brand names we believe the maxtor brand is a valuable asset and we intend to continue to offer the maxtor brand of products to consumers globally to broaden our reach into and coverage of these channels as well as optimize the impact of our marketing investments 

  

our customer service organization maintains a global network of service points to process warranty returns and manage outsourced repair vendors we generally warrant our products for periods ranging from three to five years 

  

foreign sales are subject to foreign exchange controls and other restrictions including in the case of some countries approval by the office of export administration of the us department of commerce and other us governmental agencies 

  

competition 

  

the markets that we compete in are intensely competitive with disc drive manufacturers not only competing for a limited number of major disc drive customers but also increasingly competing with other companies in the electronic data storage industry that provide alternative storage solutions such as flash memory tape optical and ssds some of the principal factors used by customers to differentiate among electronic data storage solutions manufacturers are storage capacity price per unit and price per gigabyte storageretrieval access times data transfer rates product quality and reliability supply continuity form factor warranty and brand 

  

we believe that our disc drive products are competitive with respect to each of these factors in the markets that we currently address we summarize below our principal disc drive competitors other competitors the effect of competition on price erosion for our products and product life cycles and technology 

  

principal disc drive competitors we have experienced and expect to continue to experience intense competition from a number of domestic and foreign companies some of which have greater financial and other resources than we have these competitors include independent disc drive manufacturers such as western digital as well as large captive manufacturers such as fujitsu samsung hitachi and toshiba because they produce complete computer systems and other noncompute consumer electronics and mobile devices these “captive manufacturers” can derive a greater portion of their operating margins from other components which reduces their need to realize a profit on the disc drives included in their computer systems and allows them to sell disc drives to third parties at very low margins many captive manufacturers are also formidable competitors because they have more substantial resources and greater access to their internal customers than we do in addition toshiba and samsung each are increasingly integrating other storage technologies such as flash memory hybrid disc drives and ssds into its product offerings not only may they be willing to sell their disc drives at a lower margin to advance their overall business strategy their portfolio allows them to be indifferent to which technology prevails over the other they can offer a broad range of storage media and solutions and focus on those with lowest costs and greatest sales in connection with our branded storage products in addition to 

  

competing with our disc drive competitors we also compete with companies such as lacie sa that purchase disc drives for use in their branded storage products from us and our competitors 

  

other competitors we also are experiencing competition from companies that provide alternative storage technologies such as flash memory which have substantially replaced disc drives in lower capacity handheld devices principal competitors include samsung toshiba micron sandisk and intel 

  

price erosion our industry has been characterized by continuous price erosion for disc drive products with comparable capacity performance and feature sets ie “likeforlike products” price erosion for likeforlike products “price erosion” is more pronounced during periods of 

  

   

   

   

   

disc drive manufacturers typically attempt to offset price erosion with an improved mix of disc drive products characterized by higher capacity better performance and additional feature sets andor product cost reductions 

  

we expect price erosion in our industry will continue for the foreseeable future to remain competitive we believe it will be necessary to continue to reduce prices as well as introduce new product offerings that utilize advanced technologies ahead of our competitors in order to take advantage of potentially higher initial profit margins and reduced cost structure on these new products 

  

product life cycles and changing technology our industry has been characterized by significant advances in technology which have contributed to rapid product life cycles as a result success in our industry has been dependent to a large extent on the ability to be the firsttomarket with new products allowing those disc drive manufacturers who introduce new products first to sell those products at a premium until comparable products are introduced also because our industry is characterized by continuous price erosion the existence of rapid product life cycles has necessitated the need to quickly achieve product cost effectiveness changing technology also necessitates the need for ongoing investments in research and development which may be difficult to recover due to rapid product life cycles further there is a continued need to successfully execute product transitions and new product introductions as factors such as quality reliability and manufacturing yields become of increasing competitive importance we believe that our future success will depend upon our ability to rapidly develop manufacture and market products of high quality and reliability on a costeffective basis introduction of any technology that delivers storage at an attractive price or has other features not offered by disc drives may be disruptive to the disc drive industry 

  

seasonality 

  

the disc drive industry traditionally experiences seasonal variability in demand with higher levels of demand in the second half of the calendar year this seasonality is driven by consumer spending in the backtoschool season from late summer to fall and the traditional holiday shopping season from fall to winter in addition corporate demand is typically higher during the second half of the calendar year when it budget calendars provide for more spending 

  

research and development 

  

we are committed to developing new component technologies products and alternative storage technologies including solid state technology our research and development focus is designed to bring new products to market in high volume with quality attributes that our customers expect before our competitors part of our product development strategy is to leverage a common platform and subsystem within product families to serve different market needs this platform strategy allows for more efficient resource utilization reduces 

  

exposure to changes in demand and allows for achievement of lower costs through purchasing economies our advanced technology integration effort focuses disc drive and component research on recording subsystems including readwrite heads and recording media marketspecific product technology as well as technology focused towards new business opportunities the primary purpose of our advanced technology integration effort is to ensure timely availability of mature component technologies to our product development teams as well as allowing us to leverage and coordinate those technologies in the design centers across our products in order to take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace during fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 we had product development expenses of approximately 1 billion 904 million and 805 million respectively which represented 8 8 and 9 of our consolidated revenue respectively 

  

patents and licenses 

  

as of june 27 2008 we had approximately 4015 us patents and 723 patents issued in various foreign jurisdictions as well as approximately 1188 us and 579 foreign patent applications pending the number of patents and patent applications will vary at any given time as part of our ongoing patent portfolio management activity due to the rapid technological change that characterizes the electronic data storage industry we believe that the improvement of existing products reliance upon trade secret law protection of unpatented proprietary knowhow and development of new products are generally more important than patent protection in establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage nevertheless we believe that patents are valuable to our business and intend to continue our efforts to protect and obtain patents where available in connection with our research and development program 

  

the electronic data storage industry is characterized by significant litigation relating to patent and other intellectual property rights because of rapid technological development in the electronic data storage industry some of our products have been and in the future could be alleged to infringe existing patents of third parties from time to time we receive claims that our products infringe patents of third parties although we have been able to resolve some of those claims or potential claims by obtaining licenses or rights under the patents in question without a material adverse affect on us other claims have resulted in adverse decisions or settlements in addition other claims are pending which if resolved unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations for more information on these claims see “item 3 legal proceedings” the costs of engaging in intellectual property litigation in the past have been and may be substantial irrespective of the merits of the claim or the outcome we have patent licenses with a number of companies additionally as part of our normal intellectual property practices we may be engaged in negotiations with other major electronic data storage companies and component manufacturers with respect to licenses 

  

backlog 

  

in view of our customers’ rights to cancel or defer orders with little or no penalty we believe backlog in the disc drive industry is of limited indicative value in estimating future performance and results 

  

employees 

  

at june 27 2008 we employed approximately 54000 employees temporary employees and contractors worldwide of which approximately 42000 employees were located in our asian operations we believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees at all levels we believe that our employee relations are good 

  

environmental matters 

  

our operations are subject to us and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites some of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution and these permits are subject to modification renewal and revocation by issuing authorities 

  

we have established environmental systems and continually update our environmental policies and standard operating procedures for our operations worldwide we believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws regulations and permits we budget for operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental laws if additional or more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future we could incur additional operating costs and capital expenditures 

  

some environmental laws such as the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended the “superfund” law and its state equivalents can impose liability for the cost of cleanup of contaminated sites upon any of the current or former site owners or operators or upon parties who sent waste to these sites regardless of whether the owner or operator owned the site at the time of the release of hazardous substances or the lawfulness of the original disposal activity we were identified as a potentially responsible party at several superfund sites at each of these sites we have an assigned portion of the financial liability based on the type and amount of hazardous substances disposed of by each party at the site and the number of financially viable parties we have fulfilled our responsibilities at some of these sites and remain involved in only a few at this time 

  

while our ultimate costs in connection with these sites is difficult to predict with complete accuracy based on our current estimates of cleanup costs and our expected allocation of these costs we do not expect costs in connection with these superfund sites and contaminated sites to be material 

  

we may be subject to various state federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment including those restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products for example the european union “eu” enacted the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment “rohs” which prohibits the use of certain substances including lead in certain products including disc drives put on the market after july 1 2006 as well as the waste electrical and electronic equipment “weee” directive which makes producers of electrical goods including disc drives financially responsible for specified collection recycling treatment and disposal of past and future covered products similar legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions including in the united states canada mexico china and japan 

  

if we or our suppliers fail to comply with the substance restrictions recycle requirements or other environmental requirements as they are enacted worldwide it could have a materially adverse effect on our business

 item 1a   risk factors tableend   

risks related to our business 

  

competition—our industry is highly competitive and our products have experienced and will continue to experience significant price erosion and market share variability 

  

even during periods when demand is strong the disc drive industry is intensely competitive and vendors typically experience substantial price erosion over the life of a product our competitors have historically offered existing products at lower prices as part of a strategy to gain or retain market share and customers and we expect these practices to continue we will need to continually reduce our prices to retain our market share which could adversely affect our results of operations 

  

we believe this basic industry condition of continuing price erosion and market share variability will continue as our competitors engage in aggressive pricing actions targeted to encourage shifting of customer demand the pricing environment in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2008 was substantially as we had initially expected and we expect continuous price erosion for fiscal year 2009 as our competitors continue these efforts 

  

our ability to offset the effect of price erosion through new product introductions at higher average prices is diminished to the extent competitors introduce products into particular markets ahead of our similar competing products our ability to offset the effect of price erosion is also diminished during times when product life cycles for particular products are extended allowing competitors more time to enter the market the growth of sales to distributors that serve producers of nonbranded products in the personal storage sector may also contribute to increased price erosion these customers generally have limited product qualification programs which increases the number of competing products available to satisfy their demand as a result purchasing decisions for these customers are based largely on price and terms any increase in our average price erosion would have an adverse effect on our result of operations 

  

additionally a significant portion of our success in the past has been a result of increasing our market share at the expense of our competitors particularly in the notebook and small form factor enterprise markets market share for our products can be negatively affected by our customers’ diversifying their sources of supply as our competitors enter the market for particular products as well as by our ability to ramp volume production of new product offerings when our competitors successfully introduce product offerings which are competitive with our recently introduced products our customers may quickly diversify their sources of supply any significant decline in our market share in any of our principal market applications would adversely affect our results of operations 

  

principal competitors—we compete with both independent manufacturers whose primary focus is producing technologically advanced disc drives and captive manufacturers who do not depend solely on sales of disc drives to maintain their profitability 

  

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience intense competition from a number of domestic and foreign companies including other independent disc drive manufacturers and large captive manufacturers such as 

  

   

the term “independent” in this context refers to manufacturers that primarily produce disc drives as a standalone product and the term “captive” refers to disc drive manufacturers who themselves or through affiliated 

  

entities produce complete computer or other systems that contain disc drives or other electronic data storage products captive manufacturers are formidable competitors because they have the ability to determine pricing for complete systems without regard to the margins on individual components because components other than disc drives generally contribute a greater portion of the operating margin on a complete computer system than do disc drives captive manufacturers do not necessarily need to realize a profit on the disc drives included in a complete computer system and as a result may be willing to sell disc drives to third parties at very low margins in addition captive manufacturers are also formidable competitors because they have more substantial resources than we do samsung and hitachi together with affiliated entities also sell other products to our customers including critical components like flash memory asics and flat panel displays and may be willing to sell their disc drives at a lower margin to advance their overall business strategy this may improve their ability to compete with us to the extent we are not successful competing with captive or independent disc drive manufacturers our results of operations will be adversely affected 

  

in response to customer demand for highquality highvolume and lowcost disc drives manufacturers of disc drives have had to develop large in some cases global production facilities with highly developed technological capabilities and internal controls the development of large production facilities and industry consolidation can contribute to the intensification of competition 

  

we face indirect competition from present and potential customers who evaluate from time to time whether to manufacture their own disc drives or other electronic data storage products 

  

we have also experienced competition from other companies that produce alternative storage technologies like flash memory where increased capacity improving cost lower power consumption and performance ruggedness have resulted in competition with our lower capacity smaller form factor disc drives in handheld applications while this competition has traditionally been in the markets for handheld consumer electronics applications these competitors have recently announced solid state drives “ssds” for notebook and enterprise compute applications some of these companies like samsung also sell disc drives certain customers for both enterprise and notebook compute applications have indicated an interest in investigating ssds as alternatives to hard drives in certain applications 

  

volatility of quarterly results—our quarterly operating results fluctuate sometimes significantly from period to period and this may cause our share prices to decline 

  

in the past our quarterly revenue and operating results have fluctuated sometimes significantly from period to period these fluctuations which we expect to continue may be occasioned by a variety of factors including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

as a result we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful and that these comparisons may not be an accurate indicator of our future performance our operating results in one or more future quarters may fail to meet the expectations of investment research analysts or investors which could cause an immediate and significant decline in the trading price of our common shares 

  

new product offerings—market acceptance of new product introductions cannot be accurately predicted and our results of operations will suffer if there is less demand for our new products than is anticipated 

  

we are continually developing new products with the goal that we will be able to introduce technologically advanced and lower cost disc drives into the marketplace ahead of our competitors 

  

the success of our new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors including market acceptance our ability to manage the risks associated with product transitions the effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand and the risk that our new products will have quality problems or other defects in the early stages of introduction that were not anticipated in the design of those products accordingly we cannot accurately determine the ultimate effect that our new products will have on our results of operations 

  

in addition the success of our new product introductions is dependent upon our ability to qualify as a primary source of supply with our oem customers in order for our products to be considered by our customers for qualification we must be among the leaders in timetomarket with those new products once a product is accepted for qualification testing any failure or delay in the qualification process or a requirement that we requalify can result in our losing sales to that customer until new products are introduced the limited number of highvolume oems magnifies the effect of missing a product qualification opportunity these risks are further magnified because we expect competitive pressures to result in declining sales and declining gross margins on our current generation products we cannot assure you that we will be among the leaders in timetomarket with new products or that we will be able to successfully qualify new products with our customers in the future if we cannot successfully deliver competitive products then our future results of operations may be adversely affected 

  

smaller form factor disc drives—if we do not continue to successfully market smaller form factor disc drives our business may suffer 

  

the disc drive industry is experiencing significant increases in sales of smaller form factor disc drives for an expanding number of applications in particular notebook computers and consumer electronics devices but also including personal computers and enterprise storage applications much of our recent revenue growth is derived from the sale of small form factor drives for notebook and enterprise applications our continued success will depend on our ability to develop and introduce such small form factor drives at desired price and capacity points faster than our competitors 

  

we have experienced competition from other companies that produce alternative storage technologies like solid state or flash memory where increased capacity improving cost lower power consumption and 

  

performance ruggedness have resulted in flash memory largely replacing disc drives in handheld applications we believe that the demand for disc drives to store or back up related media content from such handheld devices however continues to grow while this competition has traditionally been limited to the markets for handheld consumer electronics applications these competitors have announced ssds for notebook and enterprise compute applications 

  

if we do not suitably adapt our product offerings to successfully introduce additional smaller form factor disc drives or alternative storage products based on flash storage technology or if our competitors are successful in achieving customer acceptance of ssd products for notebook and enterprise compute applications then our customers may decrease the amounts of our products that they purchase which would adversely affect our results of operations 

  

seasonality—because we experience seasonality in the sales of our products our results of operations will generally be adversely impacted during the second half of our fiscal year 

  

sales of computer systems storage subsystems and consumer electronics tend to be seasonal and therefore we expect to continue to experience seasonality in our business as we respond to variations in our customers’ demand for disc drives in particular we anticipate that sales of our products will continue to be lower during the second half of our fiscal year in the mobile compute desktop compute and consumer electronics sectors of our business this seasonality is partially attributable to our customers’ increased sales of personal computers and consumer electronics during the winter holiday season in the enterprise sector of our business our sales are seasonal because of the capital budgeting and purchasing cycles of our end users since our working capital needs peak during periods in which we are increasing production in anticipation of orders that have not yet been received our operating results will fluctuate seasonally even if the forecasted demand for our products proves accurate furthermore it is difficult for us to evaluate the degree to which this seasonality may affect our business in future periods because of the rate and unpredictability of product transitions and new product introductions particularly in the consumer electronics market 

  

difficulty in predicting quarterly demand—if we fail to predict demand accurately for our products in any quarter we may not be able to recapture the cost of our investments 

  

the disc drive industry operates on quarterly purchasing cycles with much of the order flow in any given quarter coming at the end of that quarter our manufacturing process requires us to make significant productspecific investments in inventory in each quarter for that quarter’s production since we typically receive the bulk of our orders late in a quarter after we have made our investments there is a risk that our orders will not be sufficient to allow us to recapture the costs of our investment before the products resulting from that investment have become obsolete we cannot assure you that we will be able to accurately predict demand in the future 

  

another factor that may negatively affect our ability to recapture costs of investments in future quarters is the current uncertain condition of the domestic and global economy the current uncertainty in economic and political conditions in many of our markets may have an affect on demand for our products and render budgeting and forecasting difficult the difficulty in forecasting demand increases the difficulty in anticipating our inventory requirements which may cause us to overproduce finished goods resulting in inventory writeoffs or underproduce finished goods affecting our ability to meet customer requirements additionally the risk of inventory writeoffs could increase if we were to continue to hold higher inventory levels we cannot be certain that we will be able to recover the costs associated with increased inventory 

  

other factors that may negatively impact our ability to recapture the cost of investments in any given quarter include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

importance of timetomarket—our operating results may depend on our being among the firsttomarket and achieving sufficient production volume with our new products 

  

to achieve consistent success with our oem customers it is important that we be an early provider of new types of disc drives featuring leading highquality technology and lower per gigabyte storage cost historically our operating results have substantially depended upon our ability to be among the firsttomarket with new product offerings our market share and operating results in the future may be adversely affected if we fail to 

  

   

   

   

   

if delivery of our products is delayed our oem customers may use our competitors’ products to meet their production requirements if the delay of our products causes delivery of those oems’ computer systems into which our products are integrated to be delayed consumers and businesses may purchase comparable products from the oems’ competitors 

  

moreover we face the related risk that consumers and businesses may wait to make their purchases if they want to buy a new product that has been shipped or announced but not yet released if this were to occur we may be unable to sell our existing inventory of products that may be less efficient and cost effective compared to new products as a result even if we are among the firsttomarket with a given product subsequent introductions or announcements by our competitors of new products could cause us to lose revenue and not achieve a positive return on our investment in existing products and inventory 

  

dependence on sales of disc drives in consumer electronics applications—our sales of disc drives for consumer electronics applications which have contributed significant revenues to our results can experience significant volatility due to seasonal and other factors which could materially adversely impact our future results of operations 

  

our sales of disc drives for consumer electronics applications have contributed significant revenues to our results for the past several years the growth rate in consumer electronics products has recently begun to moderate and show more seasonal demand variability the demand for consumer electronics products can be even more volatile and unpredictable than the demand for compute products particularly as it is difficult to predict the cycles in which for example new gaming products are launched and consumer uptake of those products in some cases our products manufactured for consumer electronics applications are uniquely configured for a single customer’s application which creates a risk of exposure if the anticipated volumes are not realized this potential for unpredictable volatility is increased by the possibility of competing alternative storage technologies like flash memory meeting the customers’ cost and capacity metrics resulting in a rapid shift in demand from our products and disc drive technology generally to alternative storage technologies unpredictable fluctuations in demand for our products or rapid shifts in demand from our products to alternative storage technologies in new consumer electronics applications could materially adversely impact our future results of operations 

  

dependence on sales of disc drives directly to consumers through retail outlets—our sales of disc drives directly to consumers through retail outlets can experience significant volatility due to seasonal and other factors which could materially adversely impact our future results of operations 

  

we believe that industry demand for storage products is increasing due to the proliferation of mediarich digital content in consumer applications and is fuelling increased consumer demand for storage this has led to the expansion of solutions such as external storage products to provide additional storage capacity and to secure data in case of disaster or system failure or to provide independent storage solutions for multiple users in home or small business environments the current uncertainty in the domestic and global economy may negatively affect demand for such products further such retail sales of our branded solutions traditionally experiences seasonal variability in demand with higher levels of demand in the second half of the calendar year driven by consumer spending in the backtoschool season from late summer to fall and the traditional holiday shopping season from fall to winter additionally our ability to reach such consumers depends on our maintaining effective working relationships with major retail and online distributors failure to anticipate consumer demand for our branded solutions as well as an inability to maintain effective working relationships with retail and online distributors may adversely impact our future results of operations 

  

dependence on supply of components equipment and raw materials—if we experience shortages or delays in the receipt of critical components equipment or raw materials necessary to manufacture our products we may suffer lower operating margins production delays and other material adverse effects 

  

the cost quality and availability of components certain equipment and raw materials used to manufacture disc drives and key components like recording media and heads are critical to our success the equipment we use to manufacture our products and components is frequently custom made and comes from a few suppliers and the lead times required to obtain manufacturing equipment can be significant particularly important components for disc drives include readwrite heads aluminum or glass substrates for recording media asics spindle motors printed circuit boards and suspension assemblies we rely on sole suppliers or a limited number of suppliers for some of these components including media aluminum and glass substrates that we do not manufacture recording media and heads asics spindle motors printed circuit boards and suspension assemblies if our vendors for these components are unable to meet our requirements we could experience a shortage in supply which would adversely affect our results of operations 

  

in the past we have experienced increased costs and production delays when we were unable to obtain the necessary equipment or sufficient quantities of some components andor have been forced to pay higher prices or 

  

make volume purchase commitments or advance deposits for some components equipment or raw materials that were in short supply in the industry in general 

  

consolidation among component manufacturers may result in some component manufacturers exiting the industry or not making sufficient investments in research to develop new components 

  

if there is a shortage of or delay in supplying us with critical components equipment or raw materials then 

  

   

   

   

   

we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain critical components in a timely and economic manner or at all 

  

perpendicular recording technology—products based on perpendicular technology require increased quantities of precious metals and scarce alloys like platinum and ruthenium which increases risk of higher costs and production delays that could adversely impact our operating results 

  

perpendicular recording technology also requires recording media with more layers and the use of more precious metals and scarce alloys like platinum and ruthenium to create such layers these precious metals and scarce alloys have recently become increasingly expensive and at times difficult to acquire accordingly we will be exposed to increased risks that higher costs or reduced availability of these precious metals and scarce alloys could adversely impact our operating results 

  

importance of controlling operating costs—if we do not control our operating expenses we will not be able to compete effectively in our industry 

  

our strategy involves to a substantial degree increasing revenue and product volume while at the same time controlling operating expenses in the past these activities have included closures and transfers of facilities significant personnel reductions and efforts to increase automation moreover the reduction of personnel and closure of facilities may adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in required volumes to meet customer demand and may result in other disruptions that affect our products and customer service in addition the transfer of manufacturing capacity of a product to a different facility frequently requires qualification of the new facility by some of our oem customers we cannot assure you that these activities and transfers will be implemented on a costeffective basis without delays or disruption in our production and without adversely affecting our customer relationships and results of operations 

  

industry demand—changes in demand for computer systems and storage subsystems have caused and may cause in the future a decline in demand for our products 

  

our disc drives are components in computers computer systems storage subsystems and consumer electronics devices the demand for these products has been volatile in a weak economy consumer spending 

  

tends to decline and retail demand for personal computers and consumer electronics devices tends to decrease as does enterprise demand for computer systems and storage subsystems unexpected slowdowns in demand for computer systems storage subsystems or consumer electronic devices generally cause sharp declines in demand for disc drive products 

  

additional causes of declines in demand for our products in the past have included announcements or introductions of major new operating systems or semiconductor improvements or changes in consumer preferences such as the shift from desktop to notebook computers we believe these announcements and introductions have from time to time caused consumers to defer their purchases and made inventory obsolete whenever an oversupply of disc drives causes participants in our industry to have higher than anticipated inventory levels we experience even more intense price competition from other disc drive manufacturers than usual 

  

dependence on distributors—we are dependent on sales to distributors and retailers which may increase price erosion and the volatility of our sales 

  

in addition to our own sales force a substantial portion of our sales has been to distributors of desktop disc drive products certain of our distributors may also market other products that compete with our products product qualification programs in this distribution channel are limited which increases the number of competing products that are available to satisfy demand particularly in times of lengthening product cycles as a result purchasing decisions in this channel are based largely on price terms and product availability sales volumes through this channel are also less predictable and subject to greater volatility than sales to our oem customers 

  

to the extent that distributors reduce their purchases of our products or prices decline significantly in the distribution channel and to the extent that our distributor relationships are terminated our revenues and results of operations would be adversely affected 

  

accounting charges related to acquisition of maxtor and other recently acquired companies—we expect the acquisition of maxtor and other recently acquired companies will continue to result in additional accounting charges which may continue to have an adverse effect on our fiscal year 2009 operating results 

  

we expect that as a result of the acquisition of maxtor and other recently acquired companies our fiscal year 2009 results of operations will continue to be adversely affected by noncash accounting charges the most significant of which relates to the amortization of acquired intangible assets 

  

dependence on key customers—we may be adversely affected by the loss of or reduced delayed or cancelled purchases by one or more of our larger customers 

  

some of our key customers including hewlettpackard dell emc mitac and bell microproducts account for a large portion of our disc drive revenue we have longstanding relationships with many of our customers however if any of our key customers were to significantly reduce their purchases from us our results of operations would be adversely affected while sales to major customers may vary from period to period a major customer that permanently discontinues or significantly reduces its relationship with us could be difficult to replace in line with industry practice new customers usually require that we pass a lengthy and rigorous qualification process at the customer’s cost accordingly it may be difficult or costly for us to attract new major customers additionally mergers acquisitions consolidations or other significant transactions involving our customers generally entail risks to our business if a significant transaction involving any of our key customers results in the loss of or reduction in purchases by these key customers it could have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and prospects 

  

impact of technological change—increases in the areal density of disc drives may outpace customers’ demand for storage capacity 

  

the rate of increase in areal density or storage capacity per square inch on a disc may be greater than the increase in our customers’ demand for aggregate storage capacity particularly in certain market applications like commercial desktop compute as a result our customers’ storage capacity needs may be satisfied with lower priced low capacity disc drives these factors could decrease our sales especially when combined with continued price erosion which could adversely affect our results of operations 

  

changes in electronic data storage products—future changes in the nature of electronic data storage products may reduce demand for traditional disc drive products 

  

we expect that in the future new personal computing devices and products will be developed some of which such as internet appliances may not contain a disc drive while we are investing development resources in designing disc drives for new applications it is too early to assess the impact of these new applications on future demand for disc drive products products using alternative technologies such as flash memory optical storage and other storage technologies could become a significant source of competition to particular applications of our products which could adversely affect our results of operations 

  

new product development and technological change—if we do not develop products in time to keep pace with technological changes our operating results will be adversely affected 

  

our customers have demanded new generations of disc drive products as advances in computer hardware and software have created the need for improved storage products with features such as increased storage capacity improved performance and reliability and lower cost we and our competitors have developed improved products and we will need to continue to do so in the future such product development requires significant investments in research and development we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully complete the design or introduction of new products in a timely manner that we will be able to manufacture new products in sufficient volumes with acceptable manufacturing yields that we will be able to successfully market these new products or that these products will perform to specifications on a longterm basis in addition the impact of slowing areal density growth may adversely impact our ability to be successful 

  

when we develop new products with higher capacity and more advanced technology our operating results may decline because the increased difficulty and complexity associated with producing these products increases the likelihood of reliability quality or operability problems if our products suffer increases in failures are of low quality or are not reliable customers may reduce their purchases of our products and our manufacturing rework and scrap costs and service and warranty costs may increase in addition a decline in the reliability of our products may make us less competitive as compared with other disc drive manufacturers or competing technologies 

  

risks associated with future strategic alliances joint ventures or investments—we may not be able to identify suitable strategic alliances acquisitions joint ventures or investment opportunities or successfully acquire and integrate companies that provide complementary products or technologies 

  

our growth strategy may involve pursuing strategic alliances with and making acquisitions of forming joint ventures with or investments in other companies that are complementary to our business there is substantial competition for attractive strategic alliance acquisition joint venture and investment candidates we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition joint venture investment or strategic partnership candidates even if we were able to identify them we cannot assure you that we will be able to partner with acquire or invest in suitable candidates or integrate acquired technologies or operations successfully into our existing technologies and operations our ability to finance potential strategic alliances acquisitions joint ventures or investments will be limited by our high degree of leverage the covenants contained in the indentures that govern our outstanding indebtedness the credit agreement that governs our senior secured credit facilities and any agreements governing any other debt we may incur 

  

if we are successful in forming strategic alliances or acquiring forming joint ventures or making investments in other companies any of these transactions may have an adverse effect on our operating results particularly while the operations of an acquired business are being integrated it is also likely that integration of acquired companies would lead to the loss of key employees from those companies or the loss of customers of those companies in addition the integration of any acquired companies would require substantial attention from our senior management which may limit the amount of time available to be devoted to our daytoday operations or to the execution of our strategy growth by strategic alliance acquisition joint venture or investment involves an even higher degree of risk to the extent we combine new product offerings and enter new markets in which we have limited experience and no assurance can be given that acquisitions of entities with new or alternative business models will be successfully integrated or achieve their stated objectives 

  

furthermore the expansion of our business involves the risk that we might not manage our growth effectively that we would incur additional debt to finance these acquisitions or investments that we may have impairment of goodwill or acquired intangible assets associated with these acquisitions and that we would incur substantial charges relating to the writeoff of inprocess research and development similar to that which we incurred in connection with several of our prior acquisitions each of these items could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 

  

in addition we could issue additional common shares in connection with future strategic alliances acquisitions joint ventures or investments issuing shares in connection with such transactions would have the effect of diluting your ownership percentage of the common shares and could cause the price of our common shares to decline 

  

risk of intellectual property litigation—our products may infringe the intellectual property rights of others which may cause us to incur unexpected costs or prevent us from selling our products 

  

we cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of others historically patent applications in the united states and some foreign countries have not been publicly disclosed until the patent is issued and we may not be aware of currently filed patent applications that relate to our products or technology if patents are later issued on these applications we may be liable for infringement we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims including claims of alleged infringement of the patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties by us or our customers in connection with their use of our products 

  

we are currently subject to lawsuits involving intellectual property claims which could cause us to incur significant additional costs or prevent us from selling our products and which could adversely effect our results of operations and financial condition actions brought in the united states by convolve inc and the massachusetts institute of technology siemens ag and stormedia texas llc 

  

intellectual property litigation is expensive and timeconsuming regardless of the merits of any claim and could divert our management’s attention from operating our business in addition intellectual property lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties due to the complexity of the technical issues involved and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in defending ourselves against intellectual property claims moreover patent litigation has increased due to the current uncertainty of the law and the increasing competition and overlap of product functionality in the field if we were to discover that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of others we would need to obtain licenses from these parties or substantially reengineer our products in order to avoid infringement we might not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms or at all or be able to reengineer our products successfully moreover if we are sued for patent infringement and lose the suit we could be required to pay substantial damages andor be enjoined from using or selling the infringing products or technology any of the foregoing could cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling our products which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition see see part ii “item 8 note 9 legal environmental and other contingencies – intellectual property litigation” for a description of pending intellectual property proceedings 

  

dependence on key personnel—the loss of some key executive officers and employees could negatively impact our business prospects 

  

our future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued service of key members of management as well as marketing sales and product development personnel the loss of one or more of our key personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition we believe our future success will also depend in large part upon our ability to attract retain and further motivate highly skilled management marketing sales and product development personnel we have experienced intense competition for personnel and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our key employees or that we will be successful in attracting assimilating and retaining personnel in the future 

  

substantial leverage—our substantial leverage may place us at a competitive disadvantage in our industry 

  

we are leveraged and have significant debt service obligations our significant debt and debt service requirements could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities for example our high level of debt presents the following risks 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

significant debt service requirements—servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate cash may be affected by factors beyond our control 

  

our business may not generate cash flow in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay the principal of or interest on our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs including working capital capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements 

  

our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control we cannot assure you that 

  

   

   

   

if we cannot fund our liquidity needs we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances selling assets restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital we cannot assure you that any of these remedies could if necessary be affected on commercially reasonable terms or at all in addition our existing debt instruments permit us to incur a significant amount of additional debt if we incur additional debt above the levels now in effect the risks associated with our substantial leverage including the risk that we will be unable to service our debt or generate enough cash flow to fund our liquidity needs could intensify 

  

restrictions imposed by debt covenants—restrictions imposed by our existing credit facility may limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in our interest 

  

our existing credit facility imposes and the terms of any future debt may impose operating and other restrictions on us our existing credit facility may also limit among other things our ability to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

these covenants are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions including exceptions that permit us to make significant dividends 

  

our credit facility also requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control 

  

a breach of any of the covenants described above or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our credit facility if a default occurs the administrative agent of the credit facility may elect to declare all of our outstanding obligations under the credit facility together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable if our outstanding indebtedness were to be accelerated we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full that debt and any potential future indebtedness which would cause the market price of our common shares to decline significantly 

  

system failures—system failures caused by events beyond our control could adversely affect computer equipment and electronic data on which our operations depend 

  

our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer equipment and the electronic data stored in our databases from damage by among other things earthquake fire natural disaster power loss telecommunications failures unauthorized intrusion and other catastrophic events as our operations become more automated and increasingly interdependent our exposure to the risks posed by these types of events will increase while we continue to improve our disaster recovery processes system failures and other interruptions in our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

economic risks associated with international operations—our international operations subject us to risks related to currency exchange fluctuations longer payment cycles for sales in foreign countries seasonality and disruptions in foreign markets tariffs and duties price controls potential adverse tax consequences increased costs our customers’ credit and access to capital and healthrelated risks 

  

we have significant operations in foreign countries including manufacturing facilities sales personnel and customer support operations we have manufacturing facilities in china malaysia northern ireland singapore and thailand in addition to those in the united states a substantial portion of our desktop disc drive assembly occurs in our facility in china 

  

our international operations are subject to economic risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries including the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

political risks associated with international operations—our international operations subject us to risks related to political unrest and terrorism 

  

we have manufacturing facilities in parts of the world that periodically experience political unrest with thailand being a recent example this could disrupt our ability to manufacture important components as well as cause interruptions andor delays in our ability to ship components to other locations for continued manufacture and assembly any such delays or interruptions could result in delays in our ability to fill orders and have an adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition us and international responses to the ongoing hostilities in afghanistan and iraq and the risk of terrorist attacks or hostilities elsewhere in the world could exacerbate these risks 

  

legal and operational risks associated with international operations—our international operations subject us to risks related to staffing and management legal and regulatory requirements and the protection of intellectual property 

  

operating outside of the united states creates difficulties associated with staffing and managing our international manufacturing facilities complying with local legal and regulatory requirements and protecting our intellectual property we cannot assure you that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with applicable customs currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which we may be subject we also cannot assure you that these laws will not be modified 

  

sox 404 compliance—while we believe that we currently have adequate internal control procedures in place we are still exposed to future risks of noncompliance and will continue to incur costs associated with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 

  

we have completed the evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting as required by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 although our assessment testing and evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of june 27 2008 our internal controls over financial reporting were effective we cannot predict the outcome of our testing in future periods if our internal controls are ineffective in future periods our financial results or the market price of our shares could be adversely affected we will incur additional expenses and commitment of management’s time in connection with further evaluations 

  

volatile public markets—the price of our common shares may be volatile and could decline significantly 

  

the stock market in general and the market for technology stocks in particular has recently experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of companies if these market or industrybased fluctuations continue the trading price of our common shares could decline significantly independent of our actual operating performance and you could lose all or a substantial part of your investment the market price of our common shares could fluctuate significantly in response to several factors including among others 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

failure to pay quarterly dividends—our failure to pay quarterly dividends to our common shareholders could cause the market price of our common shares to decline significantly 

  

on july 15 2008 we declared a quarterly dividend of 012 per share that will be paid on or before august 15 2008 to our common shareholders of record as of august 1 2008 

  

our ability to pay quarterly dividends will be subject to among other things general business conditions within the disc drive industry our financial results the impact of paying dividends on our credit ratings and legal and contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends by our subsidiaries to us or by us to our common shareholders including restrictions imposed by the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility any reduction or discontinuation of quarterly dividends could cause the market price of our common shares to decline significantly our payment of dividends to holders of our common shares may in certain future quarters result in upward adjustments to the conversion rate of the 2375 convertible senior notes due august 2012 moreover in the event our payment of quarterly dividends is reduced or discontinued our failure or inability to resume paying dividends at historical levels could result in a persistently low market valuation of our common shares 

  

potential governmental action—governmental action against companies located in offshore jurisdictions may lead to a reduction in the demand for our common shares 

  

recent federal and state legislation has been proposed and additional legislation may be proposed in the future which if enacted could have an adverse tax impact on either seagate or its shareholders for example the eligibility for favorable tax treatment of taxable distributions paid to us shareholders of seagate as qualified dividends could be eliminated 

  

securities litigation—significant fluctuations in the market price of our common shares could result in securities class action claims against us 

  

significant price and value fluctuations have occurred with respect to the publicly traded securities of disc drive companies and technology companies generally the price of our common shares is likely to be volatile in the future in the past following periods of decline in the market price of a company’s securities class action lawsuits have often been pursued against that company if similar litigation were pursued against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

current global credit and financial market conditions—current global credit and financial market conditions could negatively impact the value of our current portfolio of cash equivalents shortterm investments or auction rate securities and our ability to meet our financing objectives 

  

our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase our shortterm investments consist primarily of readily marketable debt securities with remaining maturities of more than 90 days at the time of purchase 

  

the recent negative conditions in the global credit markets have prevented some investors including us from liquidating auction rate securities because the amount of securities submitted for sale at auction has exceeded the amount of purchase orders for such securities during the quarter ended june 27 2008 all 31 million of our auction rate securities continued to fail at auction as a result we recorded a temporary unrealized loss of 3 million to other comprehensive income we will continue to analyze our auction rate securities each reporting period for impairment as we may be required to record an impairment charge if in the future we determine that there is a decline in the fair value which is other than temporary 

  

while as of the date of this filing we are not aware of any other downgrades losses failed auctions or other significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or shortterm investments since june 27 2008 

  

no assurance can be given that further deterioration in conditions of the global credit and financial markets would not negatively impact our current portfolio of cash equivalents shortterm investments or auction rate securities or our ability to meet our financing objectives

dividends 

  

we are currently paying our shareholders a quarterly dividend of no more than 012 per share up to 048 per share annually so long as the aggregate amount of the dividend does not exceed 50 of our cumulative consolidated net income plus 100 of net cash proceeds received from the issuance of capital all of which are measured from the period beginning june 30 2001 and ending the most recent fiscal quarter in which financial statements are internally available 

  

we are restricted in our ability to pay dividends by the covenants contained in our revolving credit facility our declaration of dividends is also subject to cayman islands law and the discretion of our board of directors under the terms of the seagate technology shareholders agreement which was amended on september 2 2004 at least seven members of our board of directors must approve the payment of dividends in excess of 15 of our net income in the prior fiscal year provided that such consent is not required to declare and pay our regular quarterly dividend of up to 012 per share in deciding whether or not to declare quarterly dividends our directors will take into account such factors as general business conditions within the disc drive industry our financial results our capital requirements contractual and legal restrictions on the payment of dividends by our subsidiaries to us or by us to our shareholders the impact of paying dividends on our credit ratings and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant 

  

since the closing of our initial public offering in december 2002 we have paid dividends pursuant to our quarterly dividend policy totaling approximately 820 million in the aggregate the following are dividends paid in the last two fiscal years 

  

   

because we had current earnings and profits in excess of distributions for our taxable year ended june 27 2008 distributions on our common shares to us shareholders during this period were treated as dividend income for us federal income tax purposes we anticipate that we will have earnings and profits in excess of distributions in fiscal year 2009 therefore distributions to us shareholders in fiscal year 2009 are anticipated to be treated as dividend income for us federal income tax purposes nonus shareholders should consult with a tax advisor to determine appropriate tax treatment 

  

repurchases of our equity securities 

  

during fiscal year 2008 we repurchased approximately 65 million common shares through open market repurchases at an average price of 2289 for a total of approximately 15 billion of this amount we repurchased approximately 974 million under the 25 billion august 2006 stock repurchase plan and approximately 500 million under a new plan announced on february 4 2008 to repurchase up to an additional 25 billion of our outstanding common shares over 24 months 

  

as of june 27 2008 we had no amounts remaining under the august 2006 stock repurchase plan and had approximately 20 billion remaining under the february 2008 stock repurchase plan share repurchases during fiscal year 2008 were as follows

our company 

  

we are the world’s leading provider of hard disc drives based on revenue and units shipped we design manufacture market and sell hard disc drives hard disc drives commonly referred to as disc drives or hard drives are devices that store digitally encoded data on rapidly rotating platters or discs with magnetic surfaces the performance attributes of disc drives including their cost effectiveness and high storage capacities has resulted in disc drives being used as the primary medium for storing electronic data in systems ranging from desktop and notebook computers and consumer electronics devices to data centers delivering electronic data over corporate networks and the internet 

  

we produce a broad range of disc drive products addressing enterprise applications where our products are used in enterprise servers mainframes and workstations desktop applications where our products are used in desktop computers mobile computing applications where our products are used in notebook computers and consumer electronics applications where our products are used in a wide variety of devices such as digital video recorders dvrs gaming devices and other consumer electronic devices that require storage we also sell our branded storage solutions under both the seagate and maxtor brands in addition to manufacturing and selling disc drives we provide data storage services for small to mediumsized businesses including online backup data protection and recovery solutions 

  

we sell our disc drives primarily to major original equipment manufacturers oems and we also market to distributors and retailers under our globally recognized brand names we have longstanding relationships with 

  

many of our oem customers including hewlettpackard dell emc ibm and lenovo we also have key relationships with major distributors who sell our disc drive products to small oems dealers system integrators and retailers throughout most of the world substantially all of our revenue is denominated in us dollars 

  

the following table summarizes our disc drive revenue from sales to oems distributors and retailers 

  

   

the only customer exceeding 10 of our disc drive revenue for fiscal years 2006 through 2008 was hewlettpackard dell exceeded 10 of our disc drive revenue in fiscal years 2008 and 2006 

  

industry overview 

  

our industry is characterized by several trends that have a material impact on our strategic planning financial condition and results of operations 

  

disc drive industry consolidation 

  

due to the significant challenges posed by the need to continually innovate and improve manufacturing efficiency and because of the increasing amounts of capital and research and development investments required the disc drive industry has undergone significant consolidation as disc drive manufacturers and component manufacturers merged with other companies or exited the industry through such combinations disc drive manufacturers have also become increasingly vertically integrated while recent combinations have limited the opportunity for additional industry consolidation the increasing technological challenges associated levels of investment and competitive necessity of largescale operations may still drive future industry consolidation additionally we may in the future face indirect competition from present and potential customers who from time to time evaluate whether to offer electronic data storage products that may compete with our products 

  

price erosion 

  

our industry has been characterized by continuous price erosion for disc drive products with comparable capacity performance and feature sets ie “likeforlike products” price erosion for likeforlike products “price erosion” is more pronounced during periods of 

  

   

   

   

   

disc drive manufacturers typically attempt to offset price erosion with an improved mix of disc drive products characterized by higher capacity better performance and additional feature sets andor product cost reductions 

  

we expect price erosion in our industry will continue for the foreseeable future to remain competitive we believe it will be necessary to continue to reduce prices as well as introduce new product offerings that utilize advanced technologies ahead of our competitors in order to take advantage of potentially higher initial profit margins and reduced cost structure on these new products 

  

disc drive industry demand trends 

  

we believe that the disc drive industry is experiencing the following demand trends 

  

we believe that technological advances in storage technology and a proliferation of noncompute applications is increasingly driving the broad global proliferation of digital content through the creation sharing aggregation distribution consumption and protection of all types of digital content we believe that growth in digital content is being driven by increases in mediarich as well as user generated content the digitization of content previously stored in analog format and the duplication of content in multiple locations as a result of these factors the nature and amount of content being created requires increasingly higher storage capacity in order to store manage distribute back up and use such content 

  

we believe that demand for electronic data storage in the enterprise and traditional compute markets continues to grow as increasing legal and regulatory requirements and changes in the nature and amount of data being stored has necessitated additional storage additionally the proliferation of digital content in the consumer space has resulted in additional demand for storage by enterprises including those that host aggregate distribute or share such content 

  

   

the disc drive industry has recently seen the introduction of alternative technologies that directly compete with mobile disc drives for example certain manufacturers have introduced solid state drives ssds using flash memory technology which is an alternative to disc drives in certain applications due to the high capital requirements and capacity required to manufacture flash memory we believe the perceived benefits of ssds are not currently realized at an attractive cost relative to hard disc drives particularly in higher capacity applications we believe that the market for these alternative technologies is still developing and because of the current high cost per gigabyte of these storage solutions we do not expect these solutions to have a significant nearterm impact on the overall market for disc drives for mobile computing 

  

   

mission critical enterprise storage is defined by the use of high performance high capacity disc drives for use in applications which are vital to the operation of enterprises we expect the market for mission critical enterprise storage solutions to grow driven by many enterprises continuing to move network traffic to dedicated storage area networks sans in addition many enterprises are moving away from the use of serverattached storage to networkattached storage nas both of these solutions are comprised principally of high performance high capacity disc drives with sophisticated software and communications technologies in addition many enterprises are also consolidating data centers aiming to increase speed and reliability within a smaller space reducing network complexity and increasing energy savings which has led to an increased demand for more energy efficient small form factor disc drives ssd storage applications have been introduced as a potential alternative to redundant system 

  

startup or boot disc drives in addition enterprises are considering the use of ssds in applications where rapid processing is required for high volume transaction data the timing of the adoption of ssds in these applications is currently unknown as enterprises weigh the cost benefits of mission critical enterprise disc drives relative to the perceived performance benefits of ssds 

  

business critical enterprise storage is an emerging and growing application in enterprise storage whereby enterprises are using higher capacity disc drives to store less frequently accessed less timecritical but capacityintensive data because of recent decreases in cost per gigabyte business critical electronic data which historically has been stored on tape or other backup and archival technologies are now being stored on these high capacity disc drives in the longterm however we believe that this trend towards business critical systems that utilize high capacity enterprise class serial advanced technology architecture sata and serial attached small computer system interface sas will in addition to expanding the overall enterprise market likely shift some demand from disc drives used in traditional mission critical enterprise storage 

  

   

   

   

we believe that for some of the fastest growing applications described above the demand is focused on higher capacity disc drive products 

  

product life cycles and changing technology 

  

our industry has been characterized by significant advances in technology which have contributed to rapid product life cycles as a result success in our industry has been dependent to a large extent on the ability to be the firsttomarket with new products allowing those disc drive manufacturers who introduce new products first to sell those products at a premium until comparable products are introduced also because our industry is characterized by continuous price erosion the existence of rapid product life cycles has necessitated the need to quickly achieve product cost effectiveness changing technology also necessitates the need for ongoing investments in research and development which may be difficult to recover due to rapid product life cycles further there is a continued need to successfully execute product transitions and new product introductions as factors such as quality reliability and manufacturing yields become of increasing competitive importance 

  

seasonality 

  

the disc drive industry traditionally experiences seasonal variability in demand with higher levels of demand in the second half of the calendar year this seasonality is driven by consumer spending in the backtoschool season from late summer to fall and the traditional holiday shopping season from fall to winter in 

  

addition corporate demand is typically higher during the second half of the calendar year when it budget calendars provide for more spending we expect the disc drive industry to experience normal seasonal patterns of increased demand for the september 2008 quarter 

  

recording heads and media 

  

due to industry consolidation there are limited number of independent suppliers of recording heads and media available to disc drive manufacturers as a result vertically integrated disc drive manufacturers who manufacture their own recording heads and media are less dependent on external supply of recording heads and media than less vertically integrated disc drive manufacturers while we believe that there is adequate supply to meet currently identified industry demand these consolidations may limit the supply of recording heads and media from independent suppliers in the longterm 

  

commodity and other manufacturing costs 

  

the production of disc drives requires precious metals scarce alloys and industrial commodities that are subject to fluctuations in prices and the supply of which has at times been constrained recent increases in the price of many commodities have resulted in higher costs of materials used in the manufacture of disc drive products additionally adverse economic conditions such as rising fuel costs may further increase commodity manufacturing and freight costs should the disc drive industry not be able to pass these costs onto customers gross margins may be impacted 

  

industry supply balance 

  

historically the industry has from time to time experienced periods of imbalances between supply and demand to the extent that the disc drive industry builds capacity and products based on expectations of demand that do not materialize there may be an oversupply of products that could lead to increased price erosion conversely during periods where demand exceeds supply price erosion is generally more benign the industry excluding seagate exited the june 2008 quarter with what we believe to be approximately five weeks of distribution inventory in the desktop channel which is consistent with historical seasonal patterns 

  

seagate overview 

  

we are the world’s leading provider of hard disc drives based on revenue and units shipped our products address the enterprise desktop mobile computing and ce and branded solutions storage markets the seagate 35inch and 25inch disc drive units used in our branded storage products are reported in the desktop and mobile market information respectively we maintain a highly integrated approach to our business by designing and manufacturing a significant portion of the components we view as critical to our products such as readwrite heads and recording media we believe that our control of these key technologies combined with our platform design and manufacturing will enable us to achieve product performance timetomarket leadership and manufacturing flexibility which will allow us to respond to customers and market opportunities our technology ownership combined with our integrated design and manufacturing approach has allowed us to effectively leverage our leadership in traditional computing to enter new markets with only incremental product development and manufacturing costs 

  

maxtor acquisition 

  

during fiscal year 2007 we completed our integration of maxtor including customer and product transitions where we replaced maxtor designed disc drive products with seagate designed disc drive products our fiscal year 2007 included maxtor’s operating losses largely recognized during the first half of fiscal year 2007 as we transitioned maxtor products to seagate products and acquisition and integration related charges recognized over the entire fiscal year we expect to continue to incur charges the most significant of which are expected to be the amortization of acquired intangible assets 

  

operating performance 

  

   

   

   

   

   

other factors affecting income —in fiscal year 2008 our operating results included an expense of 262 million related to variable performancebased compensation as compared to none in fiscal year 2007 during fiscal year 2008 we recorded restructuring costs of approximately 50 million related to the closure of our limavady northern ireland operations and approximately 19 million related to the closure of our milpitas california operations 

  

seasonality 

  

historically we have exhibited seasonally lower unit demand during the second half of each fiscal year however there were some recent quarters in fiscal year 2006 in which these seasonal trends were moderated we saw a return to traditional seasonality in fiscal year 2007 and fiscal year 2008 for the september 2008 quarter we expect to see demand in the desktop mobile and ce markets to be seasonally higher than the june 2008 quarter while we expect demand in the enterprise market to be flat to slightly up compared to the june 2008 quarter 

  

recording heads and media 

  

the percentage of our requirements for recording media that we produce internally varies from quarter to quarter our longterm strategy is to externally purchase approximately 10 of total recording media requirements in july 2008 we announced the proposed closure of our recording media manufacturing facility in milpitas california the closure is part of our ongoing focus on costefficiencies in all areas of our business we plan to cease production at the milpitas manufacturing facility in october 2008 we are continuing to expand our recording media production facilities in singapore we expect meaningful output from our new media facility in singapore beginning the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 and we believe we will have adequate internal and external supply plans in place to support our requirements similar to our longterm strategy on recording media supply our future plans include the evaluation and external purchase of up to 10 of recording heads requirements 

  

we purchase all of our glass substrates from third parties mainly in japan which are used to manufacture our disc drives for mobile and small form factor ce products historically we purchase approximately 70 of our aluminum substrates for recording media production from third parties in december 2007 we announced the proposed closure of our substrate manufacturing facility in limavady northern ireland the proposed closure is part of our ongoing focus on costefficiencies in all areas of our business we plan to cease production at our limavady facility during the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 we are in the process of adding an aluminum substrate manufacturing facility in johor malaysia which will allow us to be more cost competitive and position us for future expansion and reduce our external substrate purchases to approximately 50 we expect meaningful output from our johor facility in during the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 

  

commodity and other manufacturing costs 

  

the production of disc drives requires precious metals scarce alloys and industrial commodities that are subject to fluctuations in prices and the supply of which has at times been constrained recent increases in the price of many commodities have resulted in higher material costs for our products additionally adverse economic conditions such as rising fuel costs may further increase our costs related to commodities manufacturing and freight should we not be able to pass these increased costs onto our customers our gross margins may be impacted 

  

in order to mitigate susceptibility to these conditions we may maintain increased inventory of precious metals scarce alloys and industrial commodities in addition we have increased our use of ocean shipments to help offset the increase in freight costs 

  

capital investments 

  

in fiscal year 2008 we made 930 million of capital investments 293 million of which we incurred in the june 2008 quarter for fiscal year 2009 we expect approximately 1 billion in capital investment will be required to ensure continued alignment of our manufacturing capacity with customer demand and to finish our planned recording media and substrate capacity expansions in asia while we continue to improve our use of capital equipment 

  

results of operations 

  

we list in the tables below the historical consolidated statements of operations in dollars and as a percentage of revenue for the fiscal years indicated 

  

   

   

fiscal year 2008 compared to fiscal year 2007 

  

revenue 

  

   

revenue growth in fiscal year 2008 reflected a 15 growth in the number of disc drives shipped we believe unit growth was driven by continued growth in digital content the resulting increase in demand for storage and customer acceptance of our new products industry disc drive demand across all markets grew by 

  

18 from fiscal year 2007 with our share of the desktop and enterprise markets increasing by 5 and 6 respectively while our share of the mobile compute and consumer electronic markets declined by 6 and 10 respectively the increase in the number of units shipped and an improved mix of products shipped was partially offset by price erosion which was relatively benign during the first half of the fiscal year as a result of favorable industry conditions including wellbalanced disc drive supply and demand while being more pronounced during the second half of fiscal year 2008 as is consistent with historical seasonal patterns 

  

our overall average sales price per unit asp for our products was 68 for fiscal year 2008 down from 71 in fiscal year 2007 as an improved mix of products shipped was more than offset by price erosion 

  

unit shipments for our products in fiscal year 2008 were as follows 

  

   

   

   

   

we maintain various sales programs such as pointofsale rebates sales price adjustments and price protection aimed at increasing customer demand we exercise judgment in formulating the underlying estimates related to distributor and retail inventory levels sales program participation and customer claims submittals in determining the provision for such programs sales programs recorded as contra revenue were approximately 9 of our gross revenue for both fiscal years 2008 and 2007 

  

cost of revenue 

  

   

for fiscal year 2008 cost of revenue increased due to a higher number of units shipped and a higher mix of products with higher average capacities feature sets and performance partially offset by a 10 decline in the average cost per unit the average cost per unit reduction was impacted by the more efficient utilization of our manufacturing capacity resulting from increased demand and the completed integration of maxtor transitions to more cost effective products and the elimination of lower margin maxtor designed products the lower cost per unit combined with increased number of units shipped and improved mix of higher margin products resulted in gross margin improvement which was partially offset by price erosion 

  

product development expense 

  

   

product development expense for fiscal year 2008 included 82 million in variable performancebased compensation compared to none in fiscal year 2007 product development expenses associated with developing alternative technologies and storage services increased by 40 million while depreciation and other research and development costs increased by approximately 29 million these increases were partially offset by a decrease of 27 million in costs associated with the maxtor acquisition 

  

marketing and administrative expense 

  

   

marketing and administrative expenses increased primarily due to increases of 53 million in variable performancebased compensation compared to none in fiscal year 2007 29 million in additional payroll expense resulting from increased headcount and salary increases 38 million increase in expenses related to our data storage services and 32 million in incremental legal expenses these increases were partially offset by a charge of approximately 40 million in fiscal year 2007 for the provision of doubtful accounts receivable related to esys technologies pte ltd and its related affiliate entities “esys” and a charge of 35 million for costs associated with the maxtor acquisition in fiscal year 2007 

  

amortization of intangibles 

  

   

the increase in the amortization of intangibles was due primarily to the acquisition of evault 

  

restructuring and other 

  

   

during fiscal year 2008 we recorded restructuring and other charges of 88 million comprised mainly of restructuring charges related to the planned closures of our limavady northern ireland and our milpitas california operations 

  

the restructuring charges associated with the limavady facility were primarily related to employee termination costs of approximately 29 million and approximately 18 million related to expected grant repayments we plan to cease production at our limavady facility during the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 and expect all activities related to this closure to be complete by the second half of fiscal year 2009 we expect additional restructuring charges of approximately 10 million to be recorded primarily over the next two quarters resulting in aggregate restructuring charges of approximately 60 million to 65 million 

  

we recorded approximately 19 million in restructuring charges associated with employee termination costs related to the planned closure of our media manufacturing facility in milpitas california we plan to cease production at our milpitas facility during the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 and expect all activities related to this closure to be complete by the second half of fiscal year 2009 we expect additional restructuring charges of approximately 17 million to be recorded primarily over the next two quarters resulting in an aggregate restructuring charge of approximately 36 million in addition as a result of the planned closure of the milpitas facility the company expects approximately 38 million relating to accelerated asset depreciation to be recorded to cost of revenue in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 

  

the remaining restructuring and other charges were primarily comprised of employee termination costs as a result of plans to continue the alignment of our global workforce with existing and anticipated business requirements around the world we expect these restructuring activities to be completed by the end of our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 

  

net other income expense 

  

   

the change in net other expense was primarily due to the positive impacts of approximately 21 million in gains from asset sales and a 15 million decrease in interest expense due to costs related to the early redemption in fiscal year 2007 of our previously outstanding 8 senior notes due 2009 partially offset by a 16 million decrease in interest income due primarily to lower yields and the recognition of a 4 million loss related to deferred compensation plan assets compared to a gain of 19 million in the prior fiscal year the corresponding gain or loss on deferred compensation plan liabilities is offset against compensation expenses in cost of revenue and operating expenses 

  

income taxes 

  

   

we recorded a provision for income taxes of 67 million for the fiscal year ended june 27 2008 compared to a benefit from income taxes of 352 million for the fiscal year ended june 29 2007 we are a foreign holding company incorporated in the cayman islands with foreign and us subsidiaries that operate in multiple taxing jurisdictions as a result our worldwide operating income is either subject to varying rates of tax or is exempt from tax due to tax holidays or tax incentive programs we operate under in china malaysia singapore switzerland and thailand these tax holidays or incentives are scheduled to expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2020 

  

our provision for income taxes recorded for the fiscal year ended june 27 2008 differs from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying a notional us 35 rate to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i the tax benefit related to the aforementioned tax holidays and tax incentive programs ii a decrease in our valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets and iii tax expense related to intercompany transactions our provision for income taxes recorded for the fiscal year ended june 29 2007 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying a notional us 35 rate to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i a decrease in our valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets and ii the tax benefit related to the aforementioned tax holidays and tax incentive programs 

  

based on our foreign ownership structure and subject to i potential future increases in our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and ii limitations imposed by internal revenue code section 382 “irc section 382” on usage of certain tax attributes further described below we anticipate that our effective tax rate in future periods will generally be less than the us federal statutory rate dividend distributions received from our us subsidiaries may be subject to us withholding taxes when and if distributed deferred tax liabilities have not been recorded on unremitted earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries as these earnings will not be subject to tax in the cayman islands or us federal income tax if remitted to our foreign parent holding company 

  

as of june 27 2008 the deferred tax asset valuation allowance recorded was 433 million approximately 22 million of this amount relates to deferred tax assets acquired in the maxtor acquisition for which the related benefit will be credited directly to goodwill when and if realized the net increase in the valuation allowance in 

  

fiscal year 2008 was 34 million in fiscal years 2007 and 2006 the valuation allowance decreased by 580 million and increased by 327 million respectively the fiscal year 2007 valuation allowance release was largely due to the completion during 2007 of the restructuring of the company’s intercompany arrangements which enables the company to forecast future us taxable income with greater certainty and us taxable income from the intercompany sale of certain maxtor assets 

  

as of june 27 2008 we recorded net deferred tax assets of 890 million the realization of 808 million of these deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on our ability to generate sufficient us and certain foreign taxable income in future periods although realization is not assured we believe that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable however may increase or decrease when we reevaluate the underlying basis for our estimates of future us and certain foreign taxable income 

  

as a result of the maxtor acquisition maxtor underwent a change in ownership within the meaning of irc section 382 on may 19 2006 in general irc section 382 places annual limitations on the use of certain tax attributes such as net operating losses and tax credit carryovers in existence at the ownership change date as of june 27 2008  13 billion and 337 million of us federal and state net operating losses respectively and 36 million of tax credit carryovers acquired from maxtor are generally subject to an annual limitation of approximately 110 million certain amounts may be accelerated into the first five years following the acquisition pursuant to irc section 382 and published notices 

  

on january 3 2005 we underwent a change in ownership under irc section 382 due to the sale of common shares to the public by our then largest shareholder new sac based on an independent valuation as of january 3 2005 the annual limitation for this change is 448 million as of june 27 2008 there were 453 million of us net operating loss carryforwards and 110 million of us tax credit carryforwards subject to irc section 382 limitation associated with the january 3 2005 change to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets associated with tax attributes subject to this irc section 382 limitation will not be realized a valuation allowance has been provided 

  

effective at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal year 2008 we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 48 fin 48 contains a twostep approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with fasb statement sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes sfas no 109 the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

  

as a result of the implementation of fin 48 we increased our liability for net unrecognized tax benefits at the date of adoption we accounted for the increase primarily as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle that resulted in a decrease to retained earnings of 3 million and an increase to goodwill of 25 million the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits as of the date of adoption was 385 million excluding interest and penalties at june 27 2008 we had approximately 374 million in total unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties the total unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would impact the effective tax rate were 63 million and 75 million as of june 29 2007 and june 27 2008 respectively 

  

our policy to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for taxes on the condensed consolidated statements of operations did not change as a result of implementing the provisions of fin 48 as of the date of adoption of fin 48 we had accrued approximately 19 million for the payment of interest and penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits this accrual increased by 3 million to approximately 22 million as of june 27 2008 

  

during the 12 months ending june 27 2008 we recognized a previously unrecognized tax benefit of approximately 13 million related to the recognition of foreign uncertain tax benefits as a result of new information obtained during the year we also recognized a previously unrecognized tax benefit of approximately 9 million for foreign uncertain tax benefits resulting in a reduction of the maxtor goodwill as a result of the expiration of certain foreign statutes of limitation for preacquisition periods 

  

during the 12 months beginning june 28 2008 we expect to reduce our unrecognized tax benefits by approximately 21 million as a result of the expiration of certain statutes of limitation we do not believe it is reasonably possible that other unrecognized tax benefits will materially change in the next 12 months however the resolution or timing of closure on open audits are highly uncertain as to when these events occur 

  

we file us federal us state and foreign tax returns the statutes of limitation for us federal returns are open for fiscal year 2003 and forward the internal revenue service has completed its examination of fiscal years ending in 2003 and 2004 for state and foreign tax returns we are generally no longer subject to tax examinations for years prior to fiscal year 2001 

  

fiscal year 2007 compared to fiscal year 2006 

  

the fiscal year 2007 results include the results of maxtor for the entire year while fiscal year 2006 include the results of maxtor from may 19 2006 to june 30 2006 in connection with the maxtor acquisition we incurred a number of accounting charges and other costs which impacted our earnings for the entire fiscal year 2007 and during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 

  

revenue 

  

   

the increase in revenue from fiscal year 2006 was driven by a 34 increase in the unit volume of disc drives shipped from 1187 million units to 1592 million units principally as a result of the retention of a portion of maxtor’s market share offset by a 9 reduction in our average sales price from 78 to 71 per unit and a weaker than anticipated demand for large capacity 35inch ata disc drives the comparative decrease in average sales price per unit in the period resulted from price erosion that more than offset improved product mix 

  

unit shipments for our products in fiscal year 2007 were as follows 

  

   

   

   

   

we maintain various sales programs aimed at increasing customer demand we exercise judgment in formulating the underlying estimates related to distributor and retail inventory levels sales program participation and customer claims submittals in determining the provision for such programs during fiscal year 2007 sales programs recorded as contra revenue were approximately 9 of our gross revenue compared to 7 of our gross revenue for fiscal year 2006 the increase in sales programs as a percentage of gross revenue from fiscal year 2006 was primarily the result of a higher mix of sales to distributors and retail customers which generally require higher program support than oem sales and to a more aggressive pricing environment pointofsale rebates sales price adjustments and price protection accounted for a substantial portion of the increase in sales programs 

  

cost of revenue 

  

   

the increase in cost of revenue for fiscal year 2007 was principally as a result of the acquisition of maxtor the gross margin percentage decrease from fiscal year 2006 was due to the sale of lower margin maxtor designed products during the first six months of fiscal year 2007 costs and charges related to our acquisition of maxtor during fiscal year 2007 including integration and retention costs of 54 million stockbased compensation of 27 million amortization of existing technology of 150 million and an 18 million accrual for the settlement of customer compensatory claims associated with quality issues related to legacy maxtor products shipped prior to the closing of the maxtor acquisition and an aggressive pricing environment in fiscal year 2007 particularly in the high capacity 35inch and mobile markets in the first half of the year and the low end oem desktop and mobile markets in the second half these effects were partially offset by the elimination of variable performancebased compensation for fiscal year 2007 compared to an expense of 76 million recorded in cost of revenue in fiscal year 2006 

  

product development expense 

  

   

the increase in product development expense from fiscal year 2006 was primarily due to increases of 115 million in salaries and benefits resulting from increased staffing levels due in part to the retention of certain maxtor employees and 10 million in stockbased compensation related to the maxtor acquisition 7 million in nonmaxtor stockbased compensation and 4 million in the writeoff of inprocess research and development related to our acquisition of evault partially offset by the elimination of variable performancebased compensation for fiscal year 2007 compared to an expense of 46 million in fiscal year 2006 

  

marketing and administrative expense 

  

   

the increase in marketing and administrative expense from fiscal year 2006 was primarily due to the recording in our first quarter of a 40 million increase in the provision for doubtful accounts receivable related to esys previously a distributor of seagate products an increase of 86 million in salaries and benefits resulting from increased staffing levels due in part to the retention of certain maxtor employees an increase of 5 million in integration and retention costs related to the maxtor acquisition an increase of 11 million in advertising expense and an increase of 11 million in nonmaxtor stockbased compensation these increases were partially offset by the elimination of variable performancebased compensation for fiscal year 2007 compared to an expense of 41 million in fiscal year 2006 

  

amortization of intangibles 

  

   

the increase in the amortization of intangibles was primarily due maxtor and evault acquisitions 

  

restructuring and other 

  

   

during fiscal year 2007 we recorded restructuring costs of approximately 33 million in connection with our ongoing restructuring activities and reversed 4 million of restructuring accruals relating to the sale of a surplus building impaired in a prior restructuring these costs were primarily a result of a restructuring plan established to continue the alignment of our global workforce with existing and anticipated business requirements primarily in our us and far east operations and asset impairments the restructuring costs were comprised of employee termination costs of approximately 14 million relating to a reduction in our workforce approximately 11 million in charges related to impaired facility improvements and equipment as a result of the alignment plan and approximately 8 million in charges related to impaired other intangibles these restructuring activities are expected to be completed by the end of fiscal year 2008 

  

net other income expense 

  

   

net other income changed by 103 million from net other income of 50 million in fiscal year 2006 to net other expense of 53 million in fiscal year 2007 the change in net other income from fiscal year 2006 was primarily due to an increase in interest expense of 81 million related to our new 15 billion longterm debt issued in september 2006 as well as debt acquired in the maxtor acquisition and expenses of 19 million incurred in october 2006 related to the early retirement of our 8 notes 

  

income taxes 

  

   

we recorded a benefit from income taxes of 352 million for the fiscal year ended june 29 2007 compared to a provision for income taxes of 84 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2006 we are a foreign holding company incorporated in the cayman islands with foreign and us subsidiaries that operate in multiple taxing jurisdictions as a result our worldwide operating income is either subject to varying rates of tax or is exempt from tax due to tax holidays or tax incentive programs we operate under in china malaysia singapore switzerland and thailand these tax holidays or incentives are scheduled to expire in whole or in part at various 

  

dates through 2020 our provision for income taxes recorded for the fiscal year ended june 29 2007 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying a notional us 35 rate to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i a decrease in our valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets and ii the tax benefit related to the aforementioned tax holidays and tax incentive programs our provision for income taxes recorded for the fiscal year ended june 30 2006 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying a notional us 35 rate to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i the tax benefit related to the aforementioned tax holidays and tax incentive programs ii an increase in our valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets and iii utilization of research tax credits generated in that year 

  

based on our foreign ownership structure and subject to i potential future increases in our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and ii limitations imposed by internal revenue code section 382 “irc section 382” on usage of certain tax attributes we anticipated that our effective tax rate in future periods will generally be less than the us federal statutory rate dividend distributions received from our us subsidiaries may be subject to us withholding taxes when and if distributed deferred tax liabilities have not been recorded on unremitted earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries as these earnings will not be subject to tax in the cayman islands or us federal income tax if remitted to our foreign parent holding company 

  

during fiscal year ended june 29 2007 we reduced our valuation allowance recorded in prior years for our deferred tax assets by 641 million this release of valuation allowance was largely due to the completion during fiscal 2007 of the restructuring of our intercompany arrangements which enabled us to forecast our us profits with greater certainty and the recording of a us taxable gain in connection with the intercompany sale of certain maxtor intangible assets as described below as a result of the valuation allowance release we recorded a us deferred tax benefit of 319 million and a 322 million reduction in the goodwill originally recorded in connection with the maxtor acquisition the reduction in goodwill was required in accordance with sfas no 109 as a result of the reversal of valuation allowance that had been previously recorded as of the date of acquisition against maxtor related deferred tax assets primarily for tax net operating loss carryovers the valuation allowance was reduced primarily to reflect the realization of acquired maxtor net operating loss carryforwards due to increased forecasts of future us taxable income and a 296 million gain for us tax purposes from the intercompany sale of certain intellectual property rights to a foreign subsidiary approximately 120 million of tax expense associated with the gain on the intercompany sale of intangibles has been capitalized in accordance with accounting research bulletin no 51 consolidated financial statements arb no 51 and is being amortized to income tax expense over a sixtymonth period which approximates the expected useful life of the intangibles sold in the intercompany transaction 

  

as of june 29 2007 we recorded net deferred tax assets of 768 million the realization of 663 million of which is primarily dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods although realization is not assured we believe that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable however may increase or decrease in subsequent quarters when we reevaluate our estimates of future taxable income 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

the following is a discussion of our principal liquidity requirements and capital resources 

  

we had approximately 11 billion in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments at june 27 2008 which includes 990 million of cash and cash equivalents which was flat from fiscal year 2007 during fiscal year 2008 cash provided by operating activities and cash provided by employee stock option exercises and employee stock purchases were offset by capital expenditures the repurchase of our common shares dividends paid to shareholders and the acquisition of metalincs inc “metalincs” 

  

in september 2006 seagate technology hdd holdings “hdd” our whollyowned direct subsidiary issued senior notes totaling 15 billion comprised of 300 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes due october 2009 the “2009 notes” 600 million aggregate principal amount of 6375 senior notes due october 2011 the “2011 notes” and 600 million aggregate principal amount of 6800 senior notes due october 2016 the “2016 notes” the notes are guaranteed by seagate technology on a full and unconditional basis 

  

as of june 27 2008 we held auction rate securities in the amount of 31 million all of which are collateralized by pools of student loans guaranteed by the federal family education loan program during the fiscal 2008 year these securities failed to settle at auction and as a result we recorded an unrealized loss of 3 million and reclassified the securities to longterm investments 

  

at june 27 2008 our exposure to subprime mortgage securities was not significant as of the date of this filing we are not aware of any downgrades losses or other significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or shortterm investments since june 27 2008 

  

until required for other purposes our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase our shortterm investments consist primarily of readily marketable debt securities with remaining maturities of more than 90 days at the time of purchase as stated in our investment policy we are averse to principal loss and ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk we mitigate default risk by maintaining portfolio investments in diversified highquality investment grade securities with limited time to maturity we monitor our investment portfolio and position our portfolio to respond appropriately to a reduction in credit rating of any investment issuer guarantor or depository we intend to maintain a highly liquid portfolio by investing only in those marketable securities that we believe have active secondary or resale markets we operate in some countries that may have restrictive regulations over the movement of cash andor foreign exchange across their borders these restrictions have not impeded our ability to conduct business in those countries nor do we expect them to in the next 12 months 

  

the following table summarizes results of statement of cash flows for the periods indicated

during fiscal year 2007 we used 402 million for net cash investing activities which was primarily attributable to expenditures for property equipment and leasehold improvements of approximately 906 million and 178 million net of cash acquired for the acquisition of evault partially offset by 675 million of maturities and sales of shortterm investments in excess of purchases of shortterm investments the approximately 906 million we invested in property equipment and leasehold improvements was primarily comprised of 

  

   

   

   

   

   

during fiscal year 2006 we used 561 million for net cash investing activities which was primarily attributable to expenditures for property equipment and leasehold improvements partially offset by the maturities and sales of shortterm investments in excess of purchases thereof as well as net cash acquired from maxtor specifically during fiscal year 2006 we invested approximately 10 billion in property equipment and leasehold improvements primarily comprised of 

  

   

   

   

   

   

during fiscal years 2006 through 2008 we increased capacity to support increased unit shipments and additional capacity for the rampup and production of seagatedesigned disc drive products to replace legacy maxtordesigned products and to continue with our planned media and substrate capacity expansions in asia for fiscal year 2009 we expect approximately 1 billion in capital investment will be required to ensure continued alignment of our manufacturing capacity with of customer demand and to finish our planned recording media and substrate capacity expansions in asia while we continue to improve our utilization of capital equipment 

  

cash used in financing activities 

  

net cash used in financing activities of approximately 15 billion for fiscal year 2008 was primarily attributable to the repurchases of our common shares totaling 15 billion additionally we paid approximately 216 million in dividends to our shareholders repaid 34 million of our longterm debt and received approximately 178 million in cash from employee stock option exercises and employee stock purchases 

  

net cash used in financing activities of 463 million for fiscal year 2007 was primarily attributable to approximately 15 billion used for the repurchases of our common shares 416 million used in the redemption of our 8 notes and 212 million of dividends paid to our shareholders largely offset by approximately 15 billion received from the issuance of longterm debt and 219 million cash provided by employee stock option exercises and employee stock purchases 

  

net cash used in financing activities of 732 million for fiscal year 2006 was primarily attributable to 399 million used in the repurchases of common shares the repayment of a 340 million term loan and 155 million of dividends paid to our shareholders partially offset by 118 million cash provided by employee stock option exercises and employee stock purchases 

  

liquidity sources and cash requirements and commitments 

  

our principal sources of liquidity as of june 27 2008 consisted of 1 approximately 11 billion in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments 2 cash we expect to generate from operations and 3 a 500 million revolving credit facility 

  

our 500 million revolving credit facility that matures in september 2011 is available for cash borrowings and for the issuance of letters of credit up to a sublimit of 100 million although no borrowings have been drawn under this revolving credit facility to date we had used 62 million for outstanding letters of credit and bankers’ guarantees as of june 27 2008 leaving 438 million for additional borrowings subject to compliance with financial covenants and other customary conditions to borrowing 

  

the credit agreement that governs our revolving credit facility contains covenants that we must satisfy in order to remain in compliance with the agreement this credit agreement contains three financial covenants 1 minimum cash cash equivalents and marketable securities 2 a fixed charge coverage ratio and 3 a net leverage ratio as of june 27 2008 we are in compliance with all covenants 

  

in october 2006 we used 416 million of the net proceeds from the september 2006 issuance of 15 billion debt to redeem the 400 million principal amount of our 8 notes and pay a 16 million redemption premium 

  

our principal liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital research and development capital expenditure needs and to service our debt in addition since the second half of fiscal year 2002 and through the june 2008 quarter we have paid dividends to our shareholders 

  

on august 17 2007 november 16 2007 february 16 2008 and may 16 2008 we paid dividends aggregating approximately 216 million or 042 per share to our common shareholders of record as of august 3 2007 november 2 2007 february 1 2008 and may 2 2008 on july 15 2008 we declared a quarterly dividend of 012 per share that will be paid on or before august 15 2008 to our common shareholders of record as of august 1 2008 in deciding whether or not to declare quarterly dividends our directors will take into account such factors as general business conditions within the disc drive industry our financial results our capital requirements contractual and legal restrictions on the payment of dividends by our subsidiaries to us or by us to our shareholders the impact of paying dividends on our credit ratings and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant 

  

with respect to the closure of our limavady and milpitas facilities we expect to pay cash restructuring charges aggregating approximately 25 million to 30 million in the next 12 months 

  

because we had current earnings and profits in excess of distributions for our taxable year ended june 27 2008 distributions on our common shares to us shareholders during this period were treated as dividend income for us federal income tax purposes we anticipate that we will have earnings and profits in excess of distributions in fiscal year 2009 therefore distributions to us shareholders in fiscal year 2009 are anticipated to be treated as dividend income for us federal income tax purposes nonus shareholders should consult with a tax advisor to determine appropriate tax treatment 

  

as a result of the acquisition of maxtor we assumed all of maxtor’s outstanding debts including without limitation its outstanding convertible senior notes maxtor’s 2375 convertible senior notes due august 2012 the “2375 notes of which 326 million were outstanding as of june 27 2008 contain a cash conversion feature that will require seagate to deliver the holders upon any conversion of these notes cash in an amount equal to the lesser of a the principal amount of the notes converted and b the asconverted value of the notes we will also be required to deliver an additional amount equal to the difference between the asconverted value of the notes and the principal amount in either cash or stock at our election to the extent holders of the maxtor 

  

notes choose to convert their notes seagate may require additional amounts of cash to meet this obligation the payment of dividends to holders of the company’s common shares have in certain quarters resulted in upward adjustments to the conversion rate of the 2375 notes and may continue in the future if the conversion rate continues to increase we may be required to book an increased amount of interest expense 

  

in december 2007 we completed our acquisition of metalincs in an all cash transaction valued at approximately 74 million metalincs provides enterprise level ediscovery software that helps companies respond to litigation and regulatory issues which requires them to search large volumes of electronic data for relevant information 

  

during fiscal year 2008 we repurchased approximately 65 million of our common shares through open market repurchases at an average price of 2289 for a total of approximately 15 billion we repurchased approximately 974 million under the 25 billion august 2006 stock repurchase plan and approximately 500 million under a new plan announced on february 4 2008 to repurchase up to an additional 25 billion of our outstanding common shares over 24 months as of june 27 2008 we had no amounts remaining under the august 2006 stock repurchase plan and had approximately 20 billion remaining under the february 2008 stock repurchase plan see part ii item 5 “market for registrant’s common shares related shareholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities—repurchases of our equity securities” during fiscal year 2007 we repurchased 62 million shares for 15 billion 

  

as part of our strategy we may selectively pursue strategic alliances acquisitions and investments any material future acquisitions alliances or investments will likely require additional capital we may enter into more of these types of arrangements in the future which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all we will require substantial amounts of cash to fund scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness future capital expenditures any increased working capital requirements and share repurchases if we are unable to meet our cash requirements out of existing cash or cash flow from operations we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain alternative financing on terms acceptable to us if at all 

  

we believe that our sources of cash will be sufficient to fund our operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months our ability to fund these requirements and comply with the financial covenants under our debt agreements will depend on our future operations performance and cash flow and is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial business and other factors some of which are beyond our control 

  

contractual obligations and commitments 

  

our contractual cash obligations and commitments as of june 27 2008 have been summarized in the table below in millions 

  

   

 

   

   

   

as a result of the adoption of fin 48 we reclassified unrecognized tax benefits to longterm income taxes payable as of june 27 2008 we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits including accrual for the payment of related interest totaling 210 million none of which is expected to be paid within one year we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate when cash settlement with a taxing authority will occur 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

as of june 27 2008 we did not have any material offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of regulation sk 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

the methods estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements the sec has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are highly uncertain at the time of estimation based on this definition our most critical policies include establishment of sales program accruals establishment of warranty accruals accounting for income taxes and the valuation of intangibles and goodwill below we discuss these policies further as well as the estimates and judgments involved we also have other key accounting policies and accounting estimates relating to uncollectible customer accounts valuation of inventory valuation of sharebased payments and acquisition related restructuring we believe that these other accounting policies and accounting estimates either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective or it is less likely that they would have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period 

  

establishment of sales program accruals we establish certain distributor and oem sales programs aimed at increasing customer demand for the distribution channel these programs typically involve rebates related to a distributor’s level of sales order size advertising or point of sale activity and price protection adjustments for oem sales rebates are typically based on an oem customer’s volume of purchases from seagate or other agreed upon rebate programs we provide for these obligations at the time that revenue is recorded based on estimated requirements we estimate these contrarevenue rebates and adjustments based on various factors including price reductions during the period reported estimated future price erosion customer orders distributor sellthrough and inventory levels program participation customer claim submittals and sales returns our estimates reflect contractual arrangements but also our judgment relating to variables such as customer claim rates and attainment of program goals and inventory and sellthrough levels reported by our distribution customers 

  

while we believe we have sufficient experience and knowledge of the market and customer buying patterns to reasonably estimate such rebates and adjustments actual market conditions or customer behavior could differ from our expectations as a result actual payments under these programs which may spread over several months 

  

after the related sale may vary from the amount accrued accordingly revenues and margins in the period in which the adjustment occurs may be affected for example if the pricing environment is more competitive than we anticipated accruals for forward price protection rebates may be inadequate in addition during periods in which our distributors’ inventories of our products are at higher than historical levels our contrarevenue estimates are subject to a greater degree of subjectivity and the potential for actual results to vary is accordingly higher currently our distributors’ inventories are within the historical range 

  

significant actual variations in any of the factors upon which we base our contrarevenue estimates could have a material effect on our operating results since fiscal year 2006 total sales programs have ranged from 7 to 9 of gross revenues due to the competitive pricing environment in our industry sales programs as a percentage of gross revenue may increase from the current range if such rebates and incentives trend upwards revenues and margins will be reduced adjustments to revenues due to under or over accruals for sales programs related to revenues reported in prior periods have averaged 03 of quarterly gross revenue for fiscal years 2006 through 2008 

  

in addition our failure to accurately predict the level of future sales returns by our distribution customers could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

establishment of warranty accruals we estimate probable product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized we generally warrant our products for a period of three to five years our warranty provision considers estimated product failure rates and trends including the timing of product returns during the warranty periods estimated repair or replacement costs and estimated costs for customer compensatory claims related to product quality issues if any we use a statistical model to help with our estimates and we exercise considerable judgment in determining the underlying estimates should actual experience in any future period differ significantly from our estimates or should the rate of future product technological advancements fail to keep pace with the past our future results of operations could be materially affected our judgment is subject to a greater degree of subjectivity with respect to newly introduced products and legacy maxtor designed products because of limited experience with those products upon which to base our warranty estimates 

  

the actual results with regard to warranty expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations if the actual rate of unit failure the cost to repair a unit or the actual cost required to satisfy customer compensatory claims are greater than that which we have used in estimating the warranty accrual since we typically outsource our warranty repairs our repair cost is subject to periodic negotiations with vendors and may vary from our estimates we also exercise judgment in estimating our ability to sell certain repaired disc drives to the extent such sales fall below our forecast warranty cost will be adversely impacted 

  

our warranty cost has ranged from approximately 2 to 25 of revenue over the last three years we review our warranty accrual quarterly for products shipped in prior periods and which are still under warranty any changes in the estimates underlying the accrual may result in adjustments that will impact the current period gross margins and income reestimates of prior warranty accruals have approximated 05 or less of revenue in fiscal years 2006 2007 and 2008 higher than anticipated failures of specific products as we had in fiscal years 2004 and 2005 and significant increases in repair or replacement costs driven by reduced sales for refurbished products as during the fiscal years 2006 and 2007 have historically been the major reasons for significant reestimates 

  

income taxes we account for income taxes pursuant to sfas no 109 and related pronouncements in applying sfas no 109 we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits recognition of income and deductions and in the calculation of specific tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions the deferred tax assets we record each period depend primarily on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions each 

  

period we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets and if necessary adjust the valuation allowance so that net deferred tax assets are recorded only to the extent we conclude it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized if our outlook for future taxable income changes significantly our assessment of the need for a valuation allowance may also change 

  

in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008 we adopted fin 48—see part ii item 8 note 4 for additional discussion the calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the internal revenue service or other tax jurisdiction if our estimates of these tax liabilities are greater or less than actual results an additional tax benefit or provision will result 

  

valuation of intangible assets and goodwill in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 141 business combinations sfas no 141 the purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired business based on their estimated fair values with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill we engage thirdparty appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed such valuations require management to make significant judgments estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from existing technology customer relationships trade names and other intangible assets the acquired company’s brand awareness and market position as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company’s product portfolio and discount rates unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results 

  

we are required to periodically evaluate the carrying values of our intangible assets for impairment if any of our intangible assets are determined to be impaired we may have to write down the impaired asset and our earnings would be adversely impacted in the period that occurs 

  

at june 27 2008 our goodwill totaled approximately 24 billion and our identifiable other intangible assets totaled 111 million in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 142 we assess the impairment of goodwill at least annually or more often if warranted by events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying value may exceed its fair value this assessment may require the projection and discounting of cash flows analysis of our market capitalization and estimating the fair values of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities estimates of cash flow are based upon among other things certain assumptions about expected future operating performance judgment is also exercised in determining an appropriate discount rate our estimates of discounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to among other things economic conditions changes to the business model or changes in operating performance significant differences between these estimates and actual cash flows could materially affect our future financial results 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

in june 2008 fasb emerging issues task force eitf issued issue no 075 determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity’s own stock eitf no 075 eitf no 075 addresses the determination of whether an instrument or an embedded feature is indexed to an entity’s own stock eitf no 075 would require us to account for our embedded conversion options as derivatives and record them on our balance sheet as a liability with subsequent fair value changes recorded in the income statement although eitf no 075 would have no impact on our actual past or future cash flows it may require us to record an additional liability on our consolidated balance sheet subsequent fair value adjustments may result in significant charges or credits recorded in our consolidated statement of operations as a result our 

  

financial position and results of operations and earnings per share may be impacted eitf no 075 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years earlier application by an entity that has previously adopted an alternative accounting policy is not permitted during fiscal year 2009 we will be evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of eitf no 075 on our fiscal year 2010 consolidated results of operations and financial condition

in april 2008 the fasb issued fsp fas 1423 determination of the useful life of intangible assets fsp fas 1423 fsp fas 1423 amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  fsp fas 1423 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 and early adoption is prohibited during fiscal year 2009 we will be evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of fsp fas 1423 on our fiscal year 2010 consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

  

in march 2008 the fasb issued sfas no 161 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 133 sfas no 161 sfas no 161 requires disclosure of how and why an entity uses derivative instruments how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position financial performance and cash flows sfas no 161 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2008 with early adoption permitted we will be evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of sfas no 161 on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

  

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141 revised 2007 business combinations sfas no 141r the standard changes the accounting for business combinations including the measurement of acquirer shares issued in consideration for a business combination the recognition of contingent consideration the accounting for preacquisition gain and loss contingencies the recognition of capitalized inprocess research and development the accounting for acquisition related restructuring liabilities the treatment of acquisition related transaction costs and the recognition of changes in the acquirer’s income tax valuation allowance sfas no 141r is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 with early adoption prohibited we currently believe that the adoption of sfas no 141r will result in the recognition of certain types of expenses on our results of operations that are currently capitalized pursuant to existing accounting standards amongst other potential impacts sfas no 141r will impact the accounting for business combinations completed by us on or after adoption in our fiscal year 2010 

  

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities—including an amendment of fasb statement no 115 sfas no 159 sfas no 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be recognized in earnings at each subsequent reporting date sfas no 159 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning 

  

after november 15 2007 we do not expect to adopt sfas no 159 with respect to our current assets and liabilities but will continue to evaluate the potential application of sfas no 159 on an ongoing basis 

  

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 fair value measurements sfas no 157 which defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements this statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements the fasb having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute accordingly sfas no 157 does not require any new fair value measurements sfas no 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years we will adopt sfas no 157 for financial assets in our fiscal year 2009 and for nonfinancial assets in our fiscal year 2010 we are currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of sfas no 157 on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

  

   

interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and longterm debt we currently do not use derivative financial instruments in either our investment portfolio or to hedge debt 

  

as stated in our investment policy we are averse to principal loss and ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk we mitigate default risk by maintaining portfolio investments in diversified highquality investment grade securities with limited time to maturity we constantly monitor our investment portfolio and position our portfolio to respond appropriately to a reduction in credit rating of any investment issuer guarantor or depository we maintain a highly liquid portfolio by investing only in marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets at june 27 2008 our exposure to subprime mortgage securities was not significant as of the date of this filing we are not aware of any downgrades losses or other significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or shortterm investments since june 27 2008 

  

we have both fixed and variable rate debt obligations we enter into debt obligations to support general corporate purposes including capital expenditures and working capital needs we currently do not use interest rate derivatives to hedge our interest rate exposure 

  

at june 27 2008 we had no marketable securities that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for a period greater than 12 months and determined no investments were otherthantemporarily impaired 

  

investment securities  as of june 27 2008 we held auction rate securities in the amount of 31 million all of which are collateralized by pools of student loans guaranteed by the federal family education loan program during the fiscal 2008 year these securities failed to settle at auction and as a result we recorded an unrealized loss of 3 million and reclassified the securities to longterm investments 

  

the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio and debt obligations as of june 27 2008 all investments other than our auction rate securities mature in three years or less included in long term debt for fiscal year 2009 is the principal amount of 326 million related to our 2375 notes which is payable upon the conversion of the 2375 notes which are currently convertible as our share price was in excess of 110 of the conversion price for at least 20 consecutive trading days during the last 30 trading days of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 unless earlier converted the 2375 notes must be redeemed in august 2012 

  

fiscal years ended 

  

   

foreign currency exchange risk we recognize all of our derivative financial instruments principally foreign currency forward contracts on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities and these derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value 

  

we may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage exposure related to certain foreign currency commitments certain foreign currency denominated balance sheet positions and anticipated foreign currency denominated expenditures our policy prohibits us from entering into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes during fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 we did not enter into any hedges of net investments in foreign operations 

  

we transact business in various foreign countries and our primary foreign currency cash flows are in countries where we have a manufacturing presence we have established a foreign currency hedging program to protect against the change in value of foreign currency cash flows resulting from operating and capital expenditures over the next year we hedge portions of our forecasted expenditures denominated in foreign currencies with foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges when the us dollar weakens significantly against the foreign currencies the increase in value of the future foreign currency expenditure is offset by gains in the value of the foreign currency forward contracts designated as hedges conversely as the us dollar strengthens the decrease in value of the future foreign currency cash flows is offset by losses in the value of the foreign currency forward contracts these foreign currency forward contracts carried at fair value may have maturities of up to twelve months 

  

for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges we initially record the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion is reported in earnings amounts in other comprehensive income are reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings 

  

we also hedge a portion of our foreign currency denominated balance sheet positions with foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings will be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates the changes in fair value of these hedges are recognized in earnings in the same period as the gains and losses from the remeasurement of the assets and liabilities these foreign currency forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments under sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 

  

we evaluate hedging effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively and record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in other income expense on the statement of operations we did not have any net gains losses recognized in other income expense for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness in fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 nor did we discontinue any cash flow hedges for a probable forecasted transaction that would not occur in fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 

  

as of june 27 2008 our notional fair values of foreign currency forward contracts totaled 729 million we do not believe that these derivatives present significant credit risks because the counterparties to the derivatives consist of highly rated financial institutions we manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with any one counterparty and we maintain limits on maximum tenor of contracts based on the credit rating of the financial institutions the table below provides information as of june 27 2008 about our derivative financial instruments comprised of foreign currency forward contracts the table is provided in us dollar equivalent amounts and presents the notional amounts at the contract exchange rates and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates

 item 1   business tableend  

we are the leader in the design manufacture and marketing of rigid disc drives rigid disc drives which are commonly referred to as disc drives or hard drives are used as the primary medium for storing electronic information in systems ranging from desktop and notebook computers and consumer electronics devices to data centers delivering information over corporate networks and the internet we produce a broad range of disc drive products addressing enterprise applications where our products are used in enterprise servers mainframes and workstations desktop applications where our products are used in desktop computers mobile computing applications where our products are used in notebook computers and consumer electronics applications where our products are used in a wide variety of devices such as digital video recorders dvrs gaming devices and other consumer electronic devices that require storage we also sell storage products containing our disc drives under the seagate technology “seagate” and maxtor corporation “maxtor” brands 

 

we sell our disc drives primarily to major original equipment manufacturers oems and also market to distributors under our globally recognized brand names for the fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 approximately 64 72 and 72 respectively of our disc drive revenue was from sales to oems of which hewlettpackard “hp” was the only customer exceeding 10 of our disc drive revenue in all of these respective periods while dell exceeded 10 of our disc drive revenue for fiscal years 2006 and 2005 we have longstanding relationships with many of our oem customers we also have key relationships with major distributors who sell our disc drive products to small oems dealers system integrators and retailers throughout most of the world shipments to distributors were approximately 30 25 and 26 of our disc drive revenue in fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively retail sales of our branded storage products in fiscal year 2007 as a percentage of our disc drive revenue was 6 compared to 3 and 2 in fiscal years 2006 and 2005 respectively for fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 approximately 30 30 and 31 respectively of our disc drive revenue came from customers located in north america approximately 27 27 and 28 respectively came from customers located in europe and approximately 43 43 and 41 respectively came from customers located in the far east substantially all of our revenue is denominated in us dollars 

 

in addition to manufacturing and selling disc drives and branded storage products we provide data storage services for small to medium size businesses including online backup data protection and recovery solutions through evault inc “evault” which we acquired in fiscal year 2007 

industry 

 

electronic data storage industry 

 

the electronic data storage industry is comprised of companies that participate across the entire electronic data storage value chain and information life cycle either by providing hardware storage solutions components for hardware storage solutions value added storage solutions software or services 

 

participants in the electronic data storage industry include 

 

major subcomponent manufacturers companies that manufacture components or subcomponents used in electronic data storage devices or solutions include companies such as komag inc “komag” which is in the process of being acquired by western digital corporation “western digital” tdk corporation “tdk” fuji electric device technology co ltd “fuji” showa denko kk “showa” and until the announced acquisition by tdk alps electric co ltd “alps” that supply heads and media to disc drive manufacturers as well as semiconductor companies such as samsung electronics co ltd “samsung” sandisk corporation “sandisk” micron technology inc “micron” and intel corporation “intel” who manufacture flash memory

storage services and software providers companies that provide services for the backup archiving recovery and discovery of electronic data or the software to enable businesses and consumers to do so such as symantec corporation “symantec” and emc 

 

demand for electronic data storage 

 

we believe that the amount of data stored and accessed electronically is growing rapidly we believe the key factor driving this demand is the mass proliferation of digital content while the electronic data storage industry has traditionally been focused on compute applications for the enterprise and corporate markets a continued proliferation of noncompute applications in the consumer electronics market is increasingly driving the broad global expansion of the demand for electronic data storage driven by 

 

  

we believe that because digital content is increasingly rich in media with the mass utilization of photos video movies and music the related storage applications and solutions increasingly require higher storage capacity to store manage distribute utilize and back up richer media digital content this in turn has resulted in the rapid growth in demand for electronic data storage hardware solutions that either directly utilize disc drives or indirectly drive the demand for additional disc drive storage to store host or back up related electronic data content 

additionally we believe that demand for electronic data storage in the enterprise and traditional compute markets have also increased as increasing legal and regulatory requirements and changes in the nature and amount of data being stored has necessitated additional storage 

 

demand for disc drives 

 

disc drives store digitally encoded data on rapidly rotating platters with magnetic surfaces disc drives provide reliable large capacity data storage and are characterized by relatively lowcost per gigabyte of storage disc drives are presently the most common storage solution in enterprise desktop mobile and higher capacity consumer electronics applications 

 

disc drives for enterprise storage the need to address the expansion in data storage management requirements has increased the demand for new hardware storage solutions for both mission critical and business critical enterprise storage 

 

many enterprises are moving away from the use of serverattached storage to networkattached storage for mission critical enterprise storage we expect the market for these solutions will likely grow resulting in greater opportunities for the sale of highperformance high capacity disc drives many enterprises are also consolidating data centers aiming to increase speed and reliability within a smaller space reduce network complexity and increase savings associated with hardware costs and maintenance this has led to an increased demand for more energy efficient smaller form factor disc drives recently solid state drives ssds storage applications that use flash storage technology as an alternative to disc drive storage technology have been introduced as a potential alternative to redundant system startup or boot disc drives 

 

in addition to the growth in mission critical enterprise storage there has also been significant growth in the use of high capacity enterprise class serial advanced technology architecture sata products in business critical storage systems used by enterprises to store and access capacityintensive noncritical data this application is exemplified by growth in content aggregation and distribution by companies like google inc yahoo inc and news corp as well as storage service providers we believe that this growth in demand for disc drives for use in business critical storage systems is likely to shift some demand from disc drives used in traditional mission critical enterprise storage in the longer term 

 

disc drives for mobile computing the mobile computing market is expected to grow faster than that for desktop computers as price and performance continue to improve notebooks are increasingly replacing desktop computers and are progressively more desirable to consumers as the need for mobility increases and wireless adoption continues to advance we estimate that in fiscal year 2007 industry shipments of disc drives for mobile compute applications grew approximately 35 from fiscal year 2006 

 

the disc drive industry has recently introduced hybrid disc drives for mobile compute applications that add flash memory to a disc drive to provide customers with a single integrated solution with enhanced performance better power utilization quicker startup speed and prolonged disc drive durability certain companies have also recently introduced ssds for mobile compute applications that directly compete with mobile disc drives the current cost per gigabyte for ssds is significantly higher than the cost per gigabyte for disc drives and is projected to remain higher for the foreseeable future which we believe will largely inhibit the use of ssds in many pricesensitive massmarket mobile compute applications 

 

disc drives for desktop computing we believe growth in disc drives for desktop computing has recently moderated in part due to the shift from desktop computers to notebook computers particularly in developed countries we believe that current growth in demand for disc drives in desktop computing is concentrated in developing markets where price remains a primary consideration in compute application data storage purchases 

 

disc drives for consumer electronics disc drives in the consumer electronics markets are primarily used in dvrs and gaming consoles which require more storage capability than can be provided in a costeffective manner through alternative technologies such as flash memory which are better suited to lower capacity consumer electronics applications we believe the demand for disc drives in consumer electronics will become more pronounced with the increased amount of high definition content that requires larger amounts of storage capacity with respect to handheld applications we believe disc drive products smaller than 18inch form factors have to a 

large extent been replaced by competing storage technologies such as solid state or flash memory however we believe that disc drives continue to be well suited in applications requiring capacities of 20 gigabytes gb or more and that the demand for disc drives as additional storage to store hold or back up related media content from such handheld devices continues to grow 

 

disc drives for branded solutions we believe that industry demand for storage products like our branded storage products is increasing due to the proliferation of mediarich digital content in consumer applications and is fuelling increased consumer demand for storage this has led to the expansion of solutions such as external storage products to provide additional storage capacity and to secure data in case of disaster or system failure or to provide independent storage solutions for multiple users in home or small business environments 

 

success in the disc drive industry depends on technology and manufacturing leadership high levels of capital and research and development investments and large scale 

 

the design and manufacturing of disc drives depends on highly advanced technology and manufacturing techniques especially in the areas of readwrite heads and recording media thereby requiring high levels of capital and research and development investments we believe the competitive dynamics of the disc drive industry favor integrated manufacturers such as ourselves with the large scale and resources to make substantial technology investments and apply them across a broad product portfolio and a wide variety of customers 

 

integrated manufacturers are companies that design and produce the critical components including readwrite heads and recording media used in their disc drives an integrated approach enables them to lower manufacturing costs and to improve the functionality of components so that they work together efficiently due to the significant challenges posed by the need to continually innovate and improve manufacturing efficiency and because of the increasing amounts of capital and research and development investments required the disc drive industry has undergone significant consolidation as disc drive manufacturers and component suppliers merged with other companies or exited the industry through such combinations disc drive manufacturers have also become increasingly vertically integrated for instance maxtor acquired quantum in april 2001 then international business machines corporation “ibm” merged its rigid disc drive business with that of hitachi through the formation of hitachi global storage technologies in december 2002 this trend of disc drive manufacturer consolidation continued with our acquisition of maxtor in may 2006 in march 2007 tdk a disc drive head manufacturer announced its pending acquisition of alps also a disc drive head manufacturer while in june 2007 western digital announced that it is acquiring komag we believe consolidation is likely to continue in the disc drive industry through combination of disc drive manufacturers component manufacturers or both as the technological challenges and the associated levels of required investment grow increasing the competitive necessity of largerscale operations 

 

disc drive technology 

 

overview 

 

all disc drives incorporate the same basic technology although individual products vary one or more discs are attached to a spindle assembly powered by a spindle motor that rotates the discs at a high constant speed around a hub the discs or recording media are the components on which data is stored and from which it is retrieved each disc typically consists of a substrate of finely machined aluminum or glass with a layer of a thinfilm magnetic material readwrite heads mounted on an arm assembly similar in concept to that of a record player fly extremely close to each disc surface and record data on and retrieve it from concentric tracks in the magnetic layers of the rotating discs the readwrite heads are mounted vertically on an eshaped assembly the eblock and the recording media are mounted inside a metal casing called the base casing 

 

upon instructions from the drive’s electronic circuitry a head positioning mechanism or actuator guides the heads to the selected track of a disc where the data is recorded or retrieved application specific integrated circuits asics and ancillary electronic control chips are collectively mounted on printed circuit boards asics move data to and from the readwrite head and the internal controller or interface which communicates with the host computer disc drive manufacturers typically use one or more of several industry standard interfaces such as 

advanced technology architecture ata sata which provides higher data transfer rates than the previous ata standard small computer system interface scsi serial attached scsi sas and fibre channel 

 

disc drive performance 

 

disc drive performance is commonly assessed by six key characteristics 

 

  

areal density 

 

areal density is a measure of storage capacity per square inch on the recording surface of a disc current areal densities are sufficient to meet the requirements of most applications today we expect the longterm demand for increased drive capacities will continue to grow proportionately with the shift in storage applications from predominantly compute applications to more highresolution media content in particular audio video and image storage data continue to increase in size with high definition video content an example of data requiring many multiples of the storage capacity of standard video demand will further intensify by the proliferation of these forms of content we have pursued and expect to continue to pursue a number of technologies to increase areal densities across the entire range of our products to increase disc drive capacities and to enable the production of higher capacity smaller form factor disc drives we led the industry in transitioning from longitudinal to perpendicular recording technology in which data bits are oriented vertically on the disc platter perpendicular to the disc surface rather than flat to the surface in order to increase areal density and capacity 

 

manufacturing 

 

we pursue an integrated business strategy based on the ownership of critical component technologies this vertical integration strategy allows us to maintain control over our product roadmap and component cost quality and availability our manufacturing efficiency and flexibility are critical elements of our integrated business strategy we continuously seek to improve our manufacturing efficiency and cost by 

 

  

manufacturing our disc drives is a complex process that begins with the production of individual components and ends with a fully assembled unit we design fabricate andor assemble a number of the most important 

components found in our disc drives including readwrite heads recording media and printed circuit boards our design and manufacturing operations are based on technology platforms that are used to produce various disc drive products that serve multiple disc drive applications and markets as an example our 35inch ata disc drive with perpendicular recording technology platform is sold to customers for use in desktop enterprise and consumer electronics applications our main technology platforms are primarily focused around areal density of media and readwrite head technologies in addition we also invest in certain other technology platforms including motors servo formatting readwrite channels solidstate technologies and sealed drive technologies our integrated platform technologies and manufacturing allow our set of products to be used in a wide range of electronic data storage applications and in a wide range of industries 

 

we believe that because of our vertical design and manufacturing strategy we are well suited to meet the challenges posed by the close interdependence of components for disc drives which is especially critical in the design and production of products incorporating perpendicular recording technology 

 

readwrite heads the function of the readwrite head is to scan across the disc as it spins magnetically recording or reading information the tolerances of recording heads are extremely demanding and require stateoftheart equipment and processes our readwrite heads are manufactured with thinfilm and photolithographic processes similar to those used to produce semiconductor integrated circuits though challenges in magnetic film properties and topographical structures are unique to the disc drive industry beginning with six and eightinch round ceramic wafers we process more than 30000 head elements at one time each of these head elements goes through more than 500 steps all in clean room environments as we expect to essentially complete our product transition to perpendicular recording technology by the end of calendar year 2008 we have upgraded our fabrication facilities in capital equipment and systems to deliver the required complexity and precision additional capital investments will be driven primarily by volume we perform all primary stages of design and manufacture of readwrite heads at our facilities we currently manufacture virtually all of our readwrite heads 

 

recording media the function of the recording media is to magnetically store information the domains where each bit of magnetic code is stored are extremely small and precisely placed as a result the manufacturing of recording media requires sophisticated thinfilm processes each disc is a sequentially processed set of sputtered layers that consist of structural magnetic protective and lubricating materials deposited on a disc substrate once complete the disc must have a high degree of physical uniformity to assure reliable and errorfree storage recording media is deposited on aluminum or glass substrates 

 

the percentage of our requirements for recording media that we produce internally varies from quarter to quarter we are continuing to expand our media production facilities in singapore and have relocated certain of the acquired maxtor media manufacturing equipment to asia we do not expect our new media facility in singapore to be fully operational until towards the end of fiscal year 2008 our longterm strategy is to externally purchase no more than 15 of total recording media requirements 

 

we purchase approximately 70 of our aluminum substrates for recording media production from third parties we are in the process of adding an aluminum substrate manufacturing facility in johor malaysia which will allow us to decrease our purchases of aluminum substrates from third parties we also purchase all of our glass substrates from third parties mainly in japan which are used in manufacturing our disc drives for mobile and small form factor consumer electronics products 

 

recently substantially all of our purchases of recording media and a significant portion of our aluminum substrates from thirdparty suppliers have been sourced from komag which is in the process of being acquired by western digital we are engaged in discussions with all our suppliers to ensure supply continuity see “item 1a risk factors related to our business — dependence on supply of components equipment and raw materials — if we experience shortages or delays in the receipt of critical components equipment or raw materials necessary to manufacture our products we may suffer lower operating margins production delays and other material adverse effects” 

 

raw materials perpendicular recording technology requires recording media with more layers and the use of more precious metals and scarce alloys in the sputtering process required to create such layers as a result products utilizing perpendicular recording technology are more sensitive to fluctuations in prices and availability of 

precious metals and scarce alloys such as platinum and ruthenium as our product offerings have transitioned to perpendicular recording technology we have increased inventory of these precious metals and scarce alloys and may continue to be required to increase inventory over time 

 

printed circuit boards we assemble and test a significant portion of the printed circuit boards used in our disc drives printed circuit boards are the boards that contain the electronic circuitry and asics that provide the electronic controls of the disc drive and on which the headdisc assembly is mounted we assemble printed circuit boards at our facilities in malaysia and china 

 

spindle motors we participate in the design of many of our spindle motors and purchase them principally from outside vendors in asia whom we have licensed to use our intellectual property and technology 

 

asics we participate in the design of many of the asics used in our disc drives for motor and actuator control such as interface controllers readwrite channels and preamplifiers we do not manufacture any asics but rather buy them from thirdparty suppliers 

 

disc drive assembly following the production of the individual components of the disc drive the first step in the manufacture of a disc drive itself is the assembly of the actuator arm readwrite heads discs and spindle motor in a housing to form the headdisc assembly the production of the headdisc assembly involves largely automated processes printed circuit boards are then mated to the headdisc assembly and the completed unit is tested prior to packaging and shipment disc drive assembly and test operations occur primarily at facilities located in china singapore and thailand we perform subassembly and component manufacturing operations at our facilities in china malaysia northern ireland singapore thailand and in the united states in california and minnesota in addition third parties manufacture and assemble components for us in various asian countries including china japan korea malaysia the philippines singapore taiwan thailand and vietnam in europe and the united states

customers 

 

we sell our disc drive products primarily to major oems and distributors oem customers incorporate our disc drives into computer systems and storage systems for resale distributors typically sell our disc drives to small oems dealers system integrators and other resellers shipments to oems were approximately 64 72 and 72 of our disc drive revenue in fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively shipments to distributors were approximately 30 25 and 26 of our disc drive revenue in fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively sales to hp accounted for approximately 16 17 and 18 of our disc drive revenue in fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively while sales to dell as a percentage of our disc drive revenue were 9 11 and 12 in fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively no other customer accounted for 10 or more of our disc drive revenue in fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 retail sales of our branded storage products in fiscal year 2007 as a percentage of our disc drive revenue increased to 6 from 3 and 2 in fiscal years 2005 and 2004 respectively see “item 1a risk factors related to our business — dependence on key customers — we may be adversely affected by the loss of or reduced delayed or cancelled purchases by one or more of our larger customers” 

 

oem customers typically enter into master purchase agreements with us these agreements provide for pricing volume discounts order lead times product support obligations and other terms and conditions the term of these agreements is usually 12 to 36 months although our product support obligations generally extend substantially beyond this period these master agreements typically do not commit the customer to buy any minimum quantity of products or create exclusive relationships deliveries are scheduled only after receipt of purchase orders in addition with limited leadtime customers may cancel or defer most purchase orders without significant penalty anticipated orders from many of our customers have in the past failed to materialize or oem delivery schedules have been deferred or altered as a result of changes in their business needs 

 

our distributors generally enter into nonexclusive agreements for the redistribution of our products they typically furnish us with a nonbinding indication of their nearterm requirements and product deliveries are generally scheduled based on a weekly confirmation by the distributor of its requirements for that week the agreements typically provide the distributors with price protection with respect to their inventory of our disc drives at the time of a reduction by us in our selling price for the disc drives and also provide limited rights to return the product 

 

we have significantly increased our sales of branded storage products to retail customers in the last two years with the maxtor acquisition further expanding our retail customer base retail sales typically require higher marketing support sales incentives and longer price protection periods 

 

we also regularly enter into agreements with our customers which obligate us to provide a limited indemnity against losses resulting from intellectual property claims these agreements are customary in our industry and typically require us to indemnify our customer against certain damages and costs incurred as a result of third party intellectual property claims arising as a result of their use of our products

with the acquisition of maxtor we acquired the right to the use the maxtor and other related brand names we believe the maxtor brand is a valuable asset and we intend to continue to offer the maxtor brand of products to consumers globally to broaden our reach into and coverage of these channels as well as optimize the impact of our marketing investments 

 

our customer service organization maintains a global network of service points to process warranty returns and manage outsourced repair vendors we generally warrant our products for periods ranging from one year to five years 

 

foreign sales are subject to foreign exchange controls and other restrictions including in the case of some countries approval by the office of export administration of the us department of commerce and other us governmental agencies 

 

competition 

 

the markets that we compete in are intensely competitive with disc drive manufacturers not only competing for a limited number of major disc drive customers but also increasingly competing with other companies in the electronic data storage industry that provide alternative storage solutions such as flash memory and ssds some of the principal factors used by customers to differentiate among electronic data storage solutions manufacturers are storage capacity price per unit and price per gigabyte storageretrieval access times data transfer rates product quality and reliability production volume capability form factor responsiveness to customer preferences and demands warranty and brand 

 

we believe that our disc drive products are competitive with respect to each of these factors in the markets that we currently address we summarize below our principal disc drive competitors other competitors the effect of competition on price erosion for our products and product life cycles and technology 

 

principal disc drive competitors we have experienced and expect to continue to experience intense competition from a number of domestic and foreign companies some of which have greater financial and other resources than we have these competitors include independent disc drive manufacturers such as western digital as well as large captive manufacturers such as fujitsu samsung hitachi and toshiba because they produce complete computer systems and other noncompute consumer electronics and mobile devices these “captive manufacturers” can derive a greater portion of their operating margins from other components which reduces their need to realize a profit on the disc drives included in their computer systems and allows them to sell disc drives to third parties at very low margins many captive manufacturers are also formidable competitors because they have more substantial resources and greater access to their internal customers than we do in addition hitachi together with affiliated entities toshiba and samsung each are increasingly integrating other storage technologies such as flash memory hybrid disc drives and ssds into its product offerings not only may they be willing to sell their disc drives at a lower margin to advance their overall business strategy their portfolio allows them to be indifferent to which technology prevails over the other they can offer a broad range of storage media and solutions and focus on those with lowest costs and greatest sales in connection with our branded storage products in addition to competing with our disc drive competitors we also compete with companies such as lacie sa that purchase disc drives for use in their branded storage products from us and our competitors 

 

other competitors we also are experiencing competition from companies that provide alternative storage technologies such as flash memory which have substantially replaced disc drives in lower capacity handheld devices principal competitors include samsung hitachi micron and sandisk 

price erosion our industry has been characterized by continuous price erosion for disc drive products with comparable capacity performance and feature sets ie “likeforlike products” price erosion for likeforlike products is more pronounced during periods of 

 

  

disc drive manufacturers typically attempt to offset price erosion with an improved mix of disc drive products characterized by higher capacity better performance and additional feature sets andor product cost reductions 

 

we expect that price erosion in our industry will continue for the foreseeable future to remain competitive it will be necessary to continue to reduce our prices as well as introduce new product offerings with increased disc drive capacities andor improved feature sets utilizing advanced technologies prior to our competitors to take advantage of potentially higher initial profit margins and reduced cost structure on these new products we have established production facilities in china malaysia singapore and thailand to achieve cost reductions 

 

product life cycles and changing technology historically competition and changing customer preference and demand in the electronic data storage industry have shortened product life cycles and caused acceleration in the development and introduction of new technology we believe that our future success will depend upon our ability to develop manufacture and market products of high quality and reliability which meet changing user needs and which successfully anticipate or respond to changes in technology and standards on a costeffective and timely basis introduction of any technology that delivers storage at an attractive price or has other features not available to disc drives will be disruptive to the disc drive industry product life cycles are also being shortened with the increasing capabilities of flash and ssd for example our 1inch disc drive’s life cycle was shortened when it was replaced by flash memory in smaller capacity handheld consumer electronics applications 

 

seasonality 

 

the disc drive industry traditionally experiences seasonal variability in demand with higher levels of demand in the second half of the calendar year this seasonality is driven by consumer spending in the backtoschool season from late summer to fall and the traditional holiday shopping season from fall to winter in addition corporate demand is higher during the second half of the calendar year when it budget calendars typically provide for more spending 

 

research and development 

 

we are committed to developing new component technologies and products and evaluating alternative storage technologies including flash storage technology we have increased our focus on research and development and realigned our disc drive development process this structured product process is designed to bring new products to market in a high volume environment and with quality attributes that our customers expect our research group which is based in pittsburgh pennsylvania is dedicated to the transition and extending the capacity of perpendicular recording technology as well as exploring alternative data storage technologies our advanced technology integration effort focuses disc drive and component research on recording subsystems including readwrite heads and recording media marketspecific product technology as well as technology focused towards new business opportunities the primary purpose of our advanced technology integration effort is to ensure timely availability of mature component technologies to our product development teams as well as allowing us to leverage and coordinate those technologies in the design centers across our products in order to take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace during fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 we had product development expenses of 904 million 805 million and 645 million respectively which represented 8 9 and 9 of our consolidated revenue respectively 

patents and licenses 

 

as of june 29 2007 we had approximately 3857 us patents and 761 patents issued in various foreign jurisdictions as well as approximately 1287 us and 651 foreign patent applications pending the number of patents and patent applications will vary at any given time as part of our ongoing patent portfolio management activity due to the rapid technological change that characterizes the information storage industry we believe that the improvement of existing products reliance upon trade secret law the protection of unpatented proprietary knowhow and development of new products are generally more important than patent protection in establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage nevertheless we believe that patents are valuable to our business and intend to continue our efforts to obtain patents where available in connection with our research and development program 

 

the information storage industry is characterized by significant litigation relating to patent and other intellectual property rights because of rapid technological development in the information storage industry some of our products have been and in the future could be alleged to infringe existing patents of third parties from time to time we receive claims that our products infringe patents of third parties although we have been able to resolve some of those claims or potential claims by obtaining licenses or rights under the patents in question without a material adverse affect on us other claims have resulted in adverse decisions or settlements in addition other claims are pending which if resolved unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations for more information on these claims see “item 3 legal proceedings” the costs of engaging in intellectual property litigation in the past have been and may be substantial regardless of the merit of the claim or the outcome we have patent crosslicenses with a number of companies additionally as part of our normal intellectual property practices we are engaged in negotiations with other major disc drive companies and component manufacturers with respect to ongoing patent crosslicenses 

 

backlog 

 

in view of customers’ rights to cancel or defer orders with little or no penalty we believe backlog in the disc drive industry is of limited indicative value in estimating future performance and results 

 

employees 

 

at june 29 2007 we employed approximately 54000 employees temporary employees and contractors worldwide of which approximately 43000 employees were located in our asian operations we believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees at all levels we believe that our employee relations are good 

 

environmental matters 

 

our operations are subject to comprehensive us and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites some of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution and these permits are subject to modification renewal and revocation by issuing authorities 

 

we believe that our operations are currently in substantial compliance with all environmental laws regulations and permits we incur operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental laws if additional or more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future we could incur additional operating costs and capital expenditures 

 

some environmental laws such as the us federal superfund law and similar state statutes can impose liability for the cost of cleanup of contaminated sites upon any of the current or former site owners or operators or upon parties who sent waste to these sites regardless of whether the owner or operator owned the site at the time of the release of hazardous substances or the lawfulness of the original disposal activity we have been identified as a potentially responsible party at several superfund sites at each of these sites the government has assigned to us a 

portion of the financial liability based on the type and amount of hazardous substances disposed of by each party at the site and the number of financially viable parties 

 

some of our current and former sites have a history of commercial and industrial operations including the use of hazardous substances groundwater and soil contamination resulting from historical operations has been identified at several of our current and former facilities and we are addressing the cleanup of these sites in cooperation with the relevant government agencies 

 

while our ultimate costs in connection with these sites is difficult to predict with complete accuracy based on our current estimates of cleanup costs and our expected allocation of these costs we do not expect costs in connection with these superfund sites and contaminated sites to be material 

 

we may be subject to various state federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment including those restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products for example the european union “eu” has enacted the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment “rohs” which prohibits the use of certain substances including lead in certain products including hard drives put on the market after july 1 2006 as well as the waste electrical and electronic equipment “weee” directive which makes producers of electrical goods including disc drives financially responsible for specified collection recycling treatment and disposal of past and future covered products similar legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions including in the united states canada mexico china and japan we will need to ensure that we comply with such laws and regulations as they are enacted and that our component suppliers also timely comply with such laws and regulations if we fail to timely comply with the legislation our customers may refuse to purchase our products which would have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

risks related to our business 

 

competition — our industry is highly competitive and our products have experienced and will continue to experience significant price erosion and market share variability 

 

even during periods when demand is stable the disc drive industry is intensely competitive and vendors typically experience substantial price erosion over the life of a product our competitors have historically offered existing products at lower prices as part of a strategy to gain or retain market share and customers and we expect these practices to continue we will need to continually reduce our prices to retain our market share which could adversely affect our results of operations 

 

we believe this basic industry condition of continuing price erosion and market share variability will continue as our competitors engage in aggressive pricing actions targeted to encourage shifting of customer demand as a result the pricing environment in 2007 continued to be very competitive especially in the march and june 2007 quarters in the mobile compute market and the market for high capacity 35inch ata disc drives and we expect pricing to remain competitive for the remainder of fiscal year 2008 as our competitors continue these efforts 

 

to the extent that historical price erosion patterns continue product life cycles may lengthen our competitors may have more time to enter the market for a particular product and we may be unable to offset these factors with new product introductions at higher average prices a second general industry trend that may contribute to increased average price erosion is the growth of sales to distributors that serve producers of nonbranded products in the personal storage sector these customers generally have limited product qualification programs which increases the number of competing products available to satisfy their demand as a result purchasing decisions for these customers are based largely on price and terms any increase in our average price erosion would have an adverse effect on our result of operations 

 

additionally a significant portion of our success in the past has been a result of increasing our market share at the expense of our competitors particularly in the notebook and small form factor enterprise markets our market share for our products can be negatively affected by our customers’ diversifying their sources of supply as our competitors enter the market for particular products when our competitors successfully introduce product offerings which are competitive with our recently introduced new products our customers may quickly diversify their sources of supply any significant decline in our market share would adversely affect our results of operations 

 

principal competitors — we compete with both independent manufacturers whose primary focus is producing technologically advanced disc drives and captive manufacturers who do not depend solely on sales of disc drives to maintain their profitability 

 

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience intense competition from a number of domestic and foreign companies including other independent disc drive manufacturers and large captive manufacturers such as 

 

 

 

the term “independent” in this context refers to manufacturers that primarily produce disc drives as a standalone product and the term “captive” refers to disc drive manufacturers who themselves or through affiliated entities produce complete computer or other systems that contain disc drives or other information storage products captive manufacturers are formidable competitors because they have the ability to determine pricing for complete systems without regard to the margins on individual components because components other than disc drives generally contribute a greater portion of the operating margin on a complete computer system than do disc drives captive manufacturers do not necessarily need to realize a profit on the disc drives included in a computer system and as a result may be willing to sell disc drives to third parties at very low margins many captive manufacturers are also formidable competitors because they have more substantial resources than we do in addition samsung and 

hitachi together with affiliated entities also sell other products to our customers including critical components like flash memory asics and flat panel displays and may be willing to sell their disc drives at a lower margin to advance their overall business strategy this may improve their ability to compete with us to the extent we are not successful competing with captive or independent disc drive manufacturers our results of operations will be adversely affected 

 

in addition in response to customer demand for highquality highvolume and lowcost disc drives manufacturers of disc drives have had to develop large in some cases global production facilities with highly developed technological capabilities and internal controls the development of large production facilities and industry consolidation can contribute to the intensification of competition we also face indirect competition from present and potential customers who evaluate from time to time whether to manufacture their own disc drives or other information storage products 

 

we have also experienced competition from other companies that produce alternative storage technologies like flash memory where increased capacity improving cost lower power consumption and performance ruggedness have resulted in competition with our lower capacity smaller form factor disc drives in handheld applications while this competition has traditionally been in the markets for handheld consumer electronics applications like personal media players these competitors have recently announced ssd products for notebook and enterprise compute applications some of these companies like samsung also sell disc drives 

 

volatility of quarterly results — our quarterly operating results fluctuate significantly from period to period and this may cause our shares prices to decline 

 

in the past our quarterly revenue and operating results have fluctuated significantly from period to period we expect this fluctuation to continue for a variety of reasons including 

 

  

as a result we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful and that these comparisons may not be an accurate indicator of our future performance our operating 

results in one or more future quarters may fail to meet the expectations of investment research analysts or investors which could cause an immediate and significant decline in the trading price of our common shares 

 

new product offerings — market acceptance of new product introductions cannot be accurately predicted and our results of operations will suffer if there is less demand for our new products than is anticipated 

 

we are continually developing new products with the goal that we will be able to introduce technologically advanced and lower cost disc drives into the marketplace ahead of our competitors we are particularly depending on the successful introduction qualification and volume sales of new lower cost products for our results in the next few quarters 

 

the success of our new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors including market acceptance our ability to manage the risks associated with product transitions the effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand and the risk that our new products will have quality problems or other defects in the early stages of introduction that were not anticipated in the design of those products accordingly we cannot accurately determine the ultimate effect that our new products will have on our results of operations 

 

in addition the success of our new product introductions is dependent upon our ability to qualify as a primary source of supply with our oem customers in order for our products to be considered by our customers for qualification we must be among the leaders in timetomarket with those new products once a product is accepted for qualification testing any failure or delay in the qualification process or a requirement that we requalify can result in our losing sales to that customer until new products are introduced the limited number of highvolume oems magnifies the effect of missing a product qualification opportunity these risks are further magnified because we expect competitive pressures to result in declining sales and declining gross margins on our current generation products we cannot assure you that we will be among the leaders in timetomarket with new products or that we will be able to successfully qualify new products with our customers in the future 

 

smaller form factor disc drives — if we do not continue to successfully market smaller form factor disc drives our business may suffer 

 

the disc drive industry is experiencing significant increases in sales of smaller form factor disc drives for an expanding number of applications in particular notebook computers and consumer electronics devices but also including personal computers and enterprise storage applications much of our recent revenue growth is derived from the sale of drives for small form factor drives for notebook and enterprise applications 

 

we have experienced competition from other companies that produce alternative storage technologies like flash memory where increased capacity improving cost lower power consumption and performance ruggedness have resulted in competition with our lower capacity smaller form factor disc drives in handheld applications this competition has largely replaced disc drive products smaller than 18inch with flash memory however we believe that disc drives continue to be well suited in applications requiring capacities of 20 gigabytes or more and that the demand for additional storage to store hold or back up related media content from such handheld devices using flash memory continues to grow while this competition has traditionally been in the markets for handheld consumer electronics applications like digital music players and personal media players these competitors are also attempting to introduce ssd products for notebook and enterprise compute applications 

 

if we do not suitably adapt our product offerings to successfully introduce additional smaller form factor disc drives or alternative storage products based on flash storage technology or if flash competitors are successful in achieving customer acceptance of ssd products for notebook and enterprise compute applications customers may decrease the amounts of our products that they purchase which would adversely affect our results of operations 

perpendicular recording technology — if products based on this technology suffer unanticipated or atypical reliability or operability problems our operating results will be adversely impacted in addition products based on perpendicular technology require increased quantities of precious metals and scarce alloys like platinum and ruthenium which increases risk of higher costs and production delays that could adversely impact our operating results 

 

in fiscal year 2007 we converted more than half of our products to products using perpendicular technology and we expect that by the end of fiscal year 2008 that all of our products will be based on perpendicular technology perpendicular recording technology poses various technological challenges including a complex integration of the recording head the disc recording channel and drive firmware as a system 

 

if these perpendicular technology based products suffer unanticipated or atypical failures that were not anticipated in the design of those products our service and warranty costs may materially increase which would adversely impact our operating results 

 

perpendicular recording technology also requires recording media with more layers and the use of more precious metals and scarce alloys like platinum and ruthenium to create such layers these precious metals and scarce alloys have recently become increasingly expensive and at times difficult to acquire as our product offerings shift increasingly to perpendicular technology we will be exposed to increased risks that higher costs or reduced availability of these precious metals and scarce alloys could adversely impact our operating results 

 

seasonality — because we experience seasonality in the sales of our products our results of operations will generally be adversely impacted during our fourth fiscal quarter 

 

because sales of computer systems storage subsystems and consumer electronics tend to be seasonal we expect to continue to experience seasonality in our business as we respond to variations in our customers’ demand for disc drives in particular we anticipate that sales of our products will continue to be lower during our fourth fiscal quarter than the rest of the year in the desktop computer notebook computer and consumer electronics sectors of our business this seasonality is partially attributable to our customers’ increased sales of personal computers and consumer electronics during the winter holiday season in the enterprise sector of our business our sales are seasonal because of the capital budgeting and purchasing cycles of our end users because our working capital needs peak during periods in which we are increasing production in anticipation of orders that have not yet been received our operating results will fluctuate seasonally even if the forecasted demand for our products proves accurate 

 

furthermore it is difficult for us to evaluate the degree to which this seasonality may affect our business in future periods because of the rate and unpredictability of product transitions and new product introductions particularly in the consumer electronics market 

 

difficulty in predicting quarterly demand — if we fail to predict demand accurately for our products in any quarter we may not be able to recapture the cost of our investments 

 

the disc drive industry operates on quarterly purchasing cycles with much of the order flow in any given quarter coming at the end of that quarter our manufacturing process requires us to make significant productspecific investments in inventory in each quarter for that quarter’s production because we typically receive the bulk of our orders late in a quarter after we have made our investments there is a risk that our orders will not be sufficient to allow us to recapture the costs of our investment before the products resulting from that investment have become obsolete we cannot assure you that we will be able to accurately predict demand in the future 

 

other factors that may negatively impact our ability to recapture the cost of investments in any given quarter include 

 

 20 

  

  

dependence on sales of disc drives in consumer electronics applications — our sales of disc drives for consumer electronics applications which have contributed significant revenues to our results can experience significant volatility due to seasonal and other factors which could materially adversely impact our future results of operations 

 

our sales of disc drives for consumer electronics applications have contributed significant revenues to our results for the past several years the growth rate in consumer electronics products has recently begun to moderate and show more seasonal demand variability the demand for consumer electronics products can be even more volatile and unpredictable than the demand for compute products in some cases our products manufactured for consumer electronics applications are uniquely configured for a single customer’s applications which creates a risk of exposure if the anticipated volumes are not realized this potential for unpredictable volatility is increased by the possibility of competing alternative storage technologies like flash memory meeting the customers’ cost and capacity metrics resulting in a rapid shift in demand from our products and disc drive technology generally to alternative storage technologies unpredictable fluctuations in demand for our products or rapid shifts in demand from our products to alternative storage technologies in new consumer electronics applications could materially adversely impact our future results of operations 

 

dependence on supply of components equipment and raw materials — if we experience shortages or delays in the receipt of critical components equipment or raw materials necessary to manufacture our products we may suffer lower operating margins production delays and other material adverse effects 

 

the cost quality and availability of components certain equipment and raw materials used to manufacture disc drives and key components like recording media and heads are critical to our success the equipment we use to manufacture our products and components is frequently custom made and comes from a few suppliers and the lead times required to obtain manufacturing equipment can be significant particularly important components for disc drives include readwrite heads aluminum or glass substrates for recording media asics spindle motors printed circuit boards and suspension assemblies we rely on sole suppliers or a limited number of suppliers for some of 

these components including recording media and aluminum and glass substrates that we do not manufacture asics spindle motors printed circuit boards and suspension assemblies recently substantially all of our purchases of recording media and a significant portion of our aluminum substrates from thirdparty suppliers have been sourced from komag which is in the process of being acquired by western digital there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to obtain alternative supply following the purchase of komag by western digital 

 

in the past we have experienced increased costs and production delays when we were unable to obtain the necessary equipment or sufficient quantities of some components andor have been forced to pay higher prices or make volume purchase commitments or advance deposits for some components equipment or raw materials such as precious metals like platinum and ruthenium that were in short supply in the industry in general 

 

historically the technology sector specifically and the economy generally have experienced economic pressure which has resulted in consolidation among component manufacturers and may result in some component manufacturers exiting the industry or not making sufficient investments in research to develop new components 

 

if there is a shortage of or delay in supplying us with critical components equipment or raw materials then 

 

  

we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain critical components in a timely and economic manner or at all 

 

importance of reducing operating costs — if we do not reduce our operating expenses we will not be able to compete effectively in our industry 

 

our strategy involves to a substantial degree increasing revenue and product volume while at the same time reducing operating expenses in the past these activities have included closures and transfers of facilities significant personnel reductions and efforts to increase automation moreover the reduction of personnel and closure of facilities may adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in required volumes to meet customer demand and may result in other disruptions that affect our products and customer service in addition the transfer of manufacturing capacity of a product to a different facility frequently requires qualification of the new facility by some of our oem customers we cannot assure you that these activities and transfers will be implemented on a costeffective basis without delays or disruption in our production and without adversely affecting our customer relationships and results of operations 

 

industry demand — changes in demand for computer systems and storage subsystems has caused and may cause in the future a decline in demand for our products 

 

our disc drives are components in computers computer systems storage subsystems and consumer electronics devices the demand for these products has been volatile in a weak economy consumer spending tends to decline and retail demand for personal computers and consumer electronics devices tends to decrease as does enterprise demand for computer systems and storage subsystems unexpected slowdowns in demand for computer systems and storage subsystems generally cause sharp declines in demand for disc drive products 

additional causes of declines in demand for our products in the past have included announcements or introductions of major new operating systems or semiconductor improvements or changes in consumer preferences such as the shift from desktop to notebook computers we believe these announcements and introductions have from time to time caused consumers to defer their purchases and made inventory obsolete whenever an oversupply of disc drives causes participants in our industry to have higher than anticipated inventory levels we experience even more intense price competition from other disc drive manufacturers than usual 

 

dependence on distributors — we are dependent on sales to distributors which may increase price erosion and the volatility of our sales 

 

a substantial portion of our sales has been to distributors of desktop disc drive products product qualification programs in this distribution channel are limited which increases the number of competing products that are available to satisfy demand particularly in times of lengthening product cycles as a result purchasing decisions in this channel are based largely on price terms and product availability sales volumes through this channel are also less predictable and subject to greater volatility than sales to our oem customers 

 

to the extent that distributors reduce their purchases of our products or prices decline significantly in the distribution channel and to the extent that our distributor relationships are terminated our revenues and results of operations would be adversely affected 

 

importance of timetomarket — our operating results may depend on our being among the firsttomarket and achieving sufficient production volume with our new products 

 

to achieve consistent success with our oem customers it is important that we be an early provider of new types of disc drives featuring leading highquality technology and lower per gigabyte storage cost historically our operating results have substantially depended upon our ability to be among the firsttomarket with new product offerings our market share and operating results in the future may be adversely affected if we fail to 

 

  

if delivery of our products is delayed our oem customers may use our competitors’ products to meet their production requirements if the delay of our products causes delivery of those oems’ computer systems into which our products are integrated to be delayed consumers and businesses may purchase comparable products from the oems’ competitors 

 

moreover we face the related risk that consumers and businesses may wait to make their purchases if they want to buy a new product that has been shipped or announced but not yet released if this were to occur we may be unable to sell our existing inventory of products that may have become less efficient and cost effective compared to new products as a result even if we are among the firsttomarket with a given product subsequent introductions or announcements by our competitors of new products could cause us to lose revenue and not achieve a positive return on our investment in existing products and inventory 

 

accounting charges and preacquisition contingencies not previously identified related to acquisition of maxtor — we expect the acquisition of maxtor with seagate will continue to result in additional accounting charges that may continue to have an adverse effect on our fiscal year 2008 operating results 

 

we expect that as a result of the acquisition of maxtor our fiscal year 2008 results of operations will continue to be adversely affected by noncash accounting charges the most significant of which relates to the amortization of acquired intangible assets in addition preacquisition contingencies not previously identified will adversely affect our results of operations 

dependence on key customers — we may be adversely affected by the loss of or reduced delayed or cancelled purchases by one or more of our larger customers 

 

some of our key customers including hp dell sony corporation “sony” emc and ibm account for a large portion of our disc drive revenue our recent acquisition of maxtor may increase our business with certain of our larger customers we have longstanding relationships with many of our customers however if any of our key customers were to significantly reduce their purchases from us our results of operations would be adversely affected while sales to major customers may vary from period to period a major customer that permanently discontinues or significantly reduces its relationship with us could be difficult to replace in line with industry practice new customers usually require that we pass a lengthy and rigorous qualification process at the customer’s cost accordingly it may be difficult or costly for us to attract new major customers additionally mergers acquisitions consolidations or other significant transactions involving our customers generally entail risks to our business if a significant transaction involving any of our key customers results in the loss of or reduction in purchases by these key customers it could have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and prospects 

 

impact of technological change — increases in the areal density of disc drives may outpace customers’ demand for storage capacity 

 

the rate of increase in areal density or storage capacity per square inch on a disc may be greater than the increase in our customers’ demand for aggregate storage capacity particularly in certain market applications like commercial desktop compute as a result our customers’ storage capacity needs may be satisfied with lower priced low capacity disc drives these factors could decrease our sales especially when combined with continued price erosion which could adversely affect our results of operations 

 

changes in information storage products — future changes in the nature of information storage products may reduce demand for traditional disc drive products 

 

we expect that in the future new personal computing devices and products will be developed some of which such as internet appliances may not contain a disc drive while we are investing development resources in designing disc drives for new applications it is too early to assess the impact of these new applications on future demand for disc drive products products using alternative technologies such as flash memory optical storage and other storage technologies could become a significant source of competition to particular applications of our products which could adversely affect our results of operations 

 

new product development and technological change — if we do not develop products in time to keep pace with technological changes our operating results will be adversely affected 

 

our customers have demanded new generations of disc drive products as advances in computer hardware and software have created the need for improved storage products with features such as increased storage capacity improved performance and reliability and lower cost we and our competitors have developed improved products and we will need to continue to do so in the future for the fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 we had product development expenses of 904 million 805 million and 645 million respectively we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully complete the design or introduction of new products in a timely manner that we will be able to manufacture new products in sufficient volumes with acceptable manufacturing yields that we will be able to successfully market these new products or that these products will perform to specifications on a longterm basis in addition the impact of slowing areal density growth may adversely impact our ability to be successful 

 

when we develop new products with higher capacity and more advanced technology our operating results may decline because the increased difficulty and complexity associated with producing these products increases the likelihood of reliability quality or operability problems if our products suffer increases in failures are of low quality or are not reliable customers may reduce their purchases of our products and our manufacturing rework and scrap costs and service and warranty costs may increase in addition a decline in the reliability of our products may make us less competitive as compared with other disc drive manufacturers 

risks associated with future acquisitions — we may not be able to identify suitable strategic alliance acquisition or investment opportunities or successfully acquire and integrate companies that provide complementary products or technologies 

 

our growth strategy may involve pursuing strategic alliances with and making acquisitions of or investments in other companies that are complementary to our business there is substantial competition for attractive strategic alliance acquisition and investment candidates we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition investment or strategic partnership candidates even if we were able to identify them we cannot assure you that we will be able to partner with acquire or invest in suitable candidates or integrate acquired technologies or operations successfully into our existing technologies and operations our ability to finance potential acquisitions will be limited by our high degree of leverage the covenants contained in the indentures that govern our outstanding indebtedness the credit agreement that governs our senior secured credit facilities and any agreements governing any other debt we may incur 

 

if we are successful in acquiring other companies these acquisitions may have an adverse effect on our operating results particularly while the operations of the acquired business are being integrated it is also likely that integration of acquired companies would lead to the loss of key employees from those companies or the loss of customers of those companies in addition the integration of any acquired companies would require substantial attention from our senior management which may limit the amount of time available to be devoted to our daytoday operations or to the execution of our strategy growth by acquisition involves an even higher degree of risk to the extent we combine new product offerings and enter new markets in which we have limited experience and no assurance can be given that acquisitions of entities with new or alternative business models such as our recent acquisition of evault will be successfully integrated or achieve their stated objectives furthermore the expansion of our business involves the risk that we might not manage our growth effectively that we would incur additional debt to finance these acquisitions or investments and that we would incur substantial charges relating to the writeoff of inprocess research and development similar to that which we incurred in connection with several of our prior acquisitions each of these items could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 

 

in addition we could issue additional common shares in connection with future acquisitions for example in may 2006 we issued approximately 97 million of our common shares in connection with our acquisition of maxtor corporation issuing shares in connection with acquisitions would have the effect of diluting your ownership percentage of the common shares and could cause the price of our common shares to decline 

 

risk of intellectual property litigation — our products may infringe the intellectual property rights of others which may cause us to incur unexpected costs or prevent us from selling our products 

 

we cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of others historically patent applications in the united states and some foreign countries have not been publicly disclosed until the patent is issued and we may not be aware of currently filed patent applications that relate to our products or technology if patents are later issued on these applications we may be liable for infringement we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims including claims of alleged infringement of the patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties by us or our licensees in connection with their use of our products 

 

we are currently subject to lawsuits involving intellectual property claims brought by convolve inc and the massachusetts institute of technology in the united states shao tong in nanjing china and siemens ag and stormedia texas llc in the united states which could cause us to incur significant additional costs or prevent us from selling our products which could adversely effect our results of operations and financial condition 

 

intellectual property litigation is expensive and timeconsuming regardless of the merits of any claim and could divert our management’s attention from operating our business in addition intellectual property lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties due to the complexity of the technical issues involved and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in defending ourselves against intellectual property claims moreover patent litigation 

has increased due to the current uncertainty of the law and the increasing competition and overlap of product functionality in the field if we were to discover that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of others we would need to obtain licenses from these parties or substantially reengineer our products in order to avoid infringement we might not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms or at all or be able to reengineer our products successfully moreover if we are sued for patent infringement and lose the suit we could be required to pay substantial damages andor be enjoined from using or selling the infringing products or technology any of the foregoing could cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling our products which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

 

dependence on key personnel — the loss of some key executive officers and employees could negatively impact our business prospects 

 

our future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued service of key members of management as well as marketing sales and product development personnel the loss of one or more of our key personnel would have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition we believe our future success will also depend in large part upon our ability to attract retain and further motivate highly skilled management marketing sales and product development personnel we have experienced intense competition for personnel and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our key employees or that we will be successful in attracting assimilating and retaining personnel in the future 

 

substantial leverage — our substantial leverage may place us at a competitive disadvantage in our industry 

 

we are leveraged and have significant debt service obligations our significant debt and debt service requirements could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities for example our high level of debt presents the following risks 

 

  

significant debt service requirements — servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate cash may be affected by factors beyond our control 

 

our business may not generate cash flow in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay the principal of or interest on our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs including working capital capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements 

our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control we cannot assure you that 

 

  

if we cannot fund our liquidity needs we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances selling assets restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital we cannot assure you that any of these remedies could if necessary be affected on commercially reasonable terms or at all in addition our existing debt instruments permit us to incur a significant amount of additional debt if we incur additional debt above the levels now in effect the risks associated with our substantial leverage including the risk that we will be unable to service our debt or generate enough cash flow to fund our liquidity needs could intensify 

 

restrictions imposed by debt covenants — restrictions imposed by our existing credit facility may limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in our interest 

 

our existing credit facility imposes and the terms of any future debt may impose operating and other restrictions on us our existing credit facility may also limit among other things our ability to 

 

  

these covenants are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions including exceptions that permit us to make significant dividends 

 

our credit facility also requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control 

 

a breach of any of the covenants described above or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our credit facility if a default occurs the administrative agent of the credit facility may elect to declare all of our outstanding obligations under the credit facility together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable if our outstanding indebtedness were to be accelerated we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full that debt and any potential future indebtedness which would cause the market price of our common shares to decline significantly 

 

system failures — system failures caused by events beyond our control could adversely affect computer equipment and electronic data on which our operations depend 

 

our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer equipment and the information stored in our databases from damage by among other things earthquake fire natural disaster power loss telecommunications failures unauthorized intrusion and other catastrophic events as our operations become more automated and increasingly interdependent our exposure to the risks posed by these types of events will increase we do not 

have a contingency plan for addressing the kinds of events referred to in this paragraph that would be sufficient to prevent system failures and other interruptions in our operations that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

economic risks associated with international operations — our international operations subject us to risks related to currency exchange fluctuations longer payment cycles for sales in foreign countries seasonality and disruptions in foreign markets tariffs and duties price controls potential adverse tax consequences increased costs our customers’ credit and access to capital and healthrelated risks 

 

we have significant operations in foreign countries including manufacturing facilities sales personnel and customer support operations we have manufacturing facilities in china malaysia northern ireland singapore and thailand in addition to those in the united states a substantial portion of our desktop disc drive assembly occurs in our facility in china 

 

our international operations are subject to economic risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries including the following 

 

 28 

 

political risks associated with international operations — our international operations subject us to risks related to political unrest and terrorism 

 

we have manufacturing facilities in parts of the world that periodically experience political unrest this could disrupt our ability to manufacture important components as well as cause interruptions andor delays in our ability to ship components to other locations for continued manufacture and assembly any such delays or interruptions could result in delays in our ability to fill orders and have an adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition us and international responses to the ongoing hostilities in afghanistan and iraq and the risk of terrorist attacks or hostilities elsewhere in the world could exacerbate these risks 

 

legal and operational risks associated with international operations — our international operations subject us to risks related to staffing and management legal and regulatory requirements and the protection of intellectual property 

 

operating outside of the united states creates difficulties associated with staffing and managing our international manufacturing facilities complying with local legal and regulatory requirements and protecting our intellectual property we cannot assure you that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with applicable customs currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which we may be subject we also cannot assure you that these laws will not be modified 

 

sox 404 compliance — while we believe that we currently have adequate internal control procedures in place we are still exposed to future risks of noncompliance and will continue to incur costs associated with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 

 

we have completed the evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting as required by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 although our assessment testing and evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of june 29 2007 our internal controls over financial reporting were effective we cannot predict the outcome of our testing in future periods if our internal controls are ineffective in future periods our financial results or the market price of our shares could be adversely affected we will incur additional expenses and commitment of management’s time in connection with further evaluations 

 

volatile public markets — the price of our common shares may be volatile and could decline significantly 

 

the stock market in general and the market for technology stocks in particular has recently experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of companies if these market or industrybased fluctuations continue the trading price of our common shares could decline significantly independent of our actual operating performance and you could lose all or a substantial part of your investment the market price of our common shares could fluctuate significantly in response to several factors including among others 

 

 29 

 

failure to pay quarterly dividends — our failure to pay quarterly dividends to our common shareholders could cause the market price of our common shares to decline significantly 

 

we paid quarterly dividends aggregating 038 per share on september 1 2006 november 17 2006 february 16 2007 and may 18 2007 to our common shareholders of record as of august 18 2006 november 3 2006 february 2 2007 and may 4 2007 respectively on july 19 2007 we declared a quarterly dividend of 010 per share that was paid by august 17 2007 to our common shareholders of record as of august 3 2007 

 

our ability to pay quarterly dividends will be subject to among other things general business conditions within the disc drive industry our financial results the impact of paying dividends on our credit ratings and legal and contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends by our subsidiaries to us or by us to our common shareholders including restrictions imposed by the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility any reduction or discontinuation of quarterly dividends could cause the market price of our common shares to decline significantly our payment of dividends to holders of our common shares may in certain future quarters result in upward adjustments to the conversion rate of the 2375 convertible senior notes due 2012 moreover in the event our payment of quarterly dividends is reduced or discontinued our failure or inability to resume paying dividends at historical levels could result in a persistently low market valuation of our common shares 

 

potential governmental action — governmental action against companies located in offshore jurisdictions may lead to a reduction in the demand for our common shares 

 

recent federal and state legislation has been proposed and additional legislation may be proposed in the future which if enacted could have an adverse tax impact on either seagate or its shareholders for example the eligibility for favorable tax treatment of taxable distributions paid to us shareholders of seagate as qualified dividends could be eliminated 

 

securities litigation — significant fluctuations in the market price of our common shares could result in securities class action claims against us 

 

significant price and value fluctuations have occurred with respect to the publicly traded securities of disc drive companies and technology companies generally the price of our common shares is likely to be volatile in the future in the past following periods of decline in the market price of a company’s securities class action lawsuits have often been pursued against that company if similar litigation were pursued against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity

dividends 

 

we are currently paying our shareholders a quarterly dividend of no more than 010 per share up to 040 per share annually so long as the aggregate amount of the dividend does not exceed 50 of our cumulative consolidated net income plus 100 of net cash proceeds received from the issuance of capital all of which are 

measured from the period beginning june 30 2001 and ending the most recent fiscal quarter in which financial statements are internally available 

 

we are restricted in our ability to pay dividends by the covenants contained in the revolving credit facility our declaration of dividends is also subject to cayman islands law and the discretion of our board of directors under the terms of the seagate technology shareholders agreement which was amended on september 2 2004 at least seven members of our board of directors must approve the payment of dividends in excess of 15 of our net income in the prior fiscal year provided that such consent is not required to declare and pay our regular quarterly dividend of up to 010 per share in deciding whether or not to declare quarterly dividends our directors will take into account such factors as general business conditions within the disc drive industry our financial results our capital requirements contractual and legal restrictions on the payment of dividends by our subsidiaries to us or by us to our shareholders the impact of paying dividends on our credit ratings and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant 

 

since the closing of our initial public offering in december 2002 we have paid dividends pursuant to our quarterly dividend policy totaling approximately 604 million in the aggregate the following are dividends paid in the last two fiscal years 

 

 

 

because we had current earnings and profits in excess of distributions for our taxable year ended june 29 2007 distributions on our common shares to us shareholders during this period were treated as dividend income for us federal income tax purposes we anticipate that we will have earnings and profits in excess of distributions in fiscal year 2008 therefore distributions to us shareholders in fiscal year 2008 are anticipated to be treated as dividend income for us federal income tax purposes nonus shareholders should consult with a tax advisor to determine appropriate tax treatment 

 

furthermore we believe that we were a foreign personal holding company for us federal income tax purposes for our taxable years ended july 1 2005 and july 2 2004 pursuant to the american jobs creation act of 2004 foreign corporations will be excluded from the application of the personal holding company rules of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” effective for taxable years of foreign corporations beginning after december 31 2004 for us the effective date was our fiscal year beginning july 2 2005 as a result if taxable distributions on our common shares are made after july 1 2005 us shareholders who are individuals may be eligible for reduced rates of taxation applicable to certain dividend income currently a maximum rate of 15 on distributions made after the effective date 

 

repurchases of our equity securities 

 

on august 8 2006 we announced that our board of directors had authorized the use of up to 25 billion for the repurchase of our outstanding common shares over a twoyear period from the authorization of this repurchase program and through the fiscal year ended june 29 2007 we repurchased approximately 620 million shares at an average price of 2462 all of which were considered cancelled and are no longer outstanding we repurchased these shares through a combination of open market purchases and prepaid forward agreements with large financial institutions according to which we prepaid the financial institutions a fixed amount to deliver a variable number of shares at future dates we entered into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the volume weighted average price “vwap” of our common shares our policy to date 

has been to enter into such transactions only when the discount that we receive is higher than the foregone return on our cash prepayment to the financial institution there were no explicit commissions or fees on these prepaid forward agreements under the terms of these agreements there was no requirement for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us these prepaid forward agreements were not derivatives because the company had prepaid all amounts and had no remaining obligation the agreements do not contain an embedded derivative the prepayments were recorded as a reduction to shareholders’ equity when paid and the shares were deducted from shares outstanding the agreements require the physical delivery of shares there were no settlement alternatives except in the case of certain defined extraordinary events which are outside the control of seagate and the financial institutions the parameters used to calculate the final number of shares deliverable are the total notional amount of the contract and the average vwap of our common shares during the contract period less the agreed upon discount the contracts are indexed solely to the price of seagate’s common shares 

 

during fiscal year 2007 we repurchased 243 million shares through open market repurchases in addition we made payments totaling 950 million under prepaid forward agreements and took delivery of 377 million shares using prepaid forward agreements shares physically delivered to us were cancelled and are no longer outstanding at june 29 2007 there were no outstanding prepaid forward agreements to repurchase our common shares 

 

as of june 29 2007 we had approximately 974 million remaining under the authorized 25 billion stock repurchase program share repurchases during fiscal year 2007 were as follows 

 

 

 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 we repurchased 167 million shares under a previously authorized stock repurchase program the program authorizing repurchases in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 was completed and there is no outstanding authority for further shares to be purchased under that program

our company 

 

we are the leader in the design manufacture and marketing of rigid disc drives rigid disc drives which are commonly referred to as disc drives or hard drives are used as the primary medium for storing electronic information in systems ranging from desktop and notebook computers and consumer electronics devices to data centers delivering information over corporate networks and the internet we produce a broad range of disc drive products addressing enterprise applications where our products are used in enterprise servers mainframes and workstations desktop applications where our products are used in desktop computers mobile computing applications where our products are used in notebook computers and consumer electronics applications where our products are used in a wide variety of devices such as digital video recorders dvrs gaming devices and other consumer electronic devices that require storage we also sell under the seagate and maxtor brands storage products containing our disc drives 

 

we sell our disc drives primarily to major original equipment manufacturers oems and also market to distributors under our globally recognized brand names for the fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 approximately 64 72 and 72 respectively of our disc drive revenue was from sales to oems of which hewlettpackard was the only customer exceeding 10 of our disc drive revenue in all of these respective periods while dell exceeded 10 of our disc drive revenue in fiscal years 2006 and 2005 we have longstanding relationships with many of our oem customers we also have key relationships with major distributors who sell our disc drive products to small oems dealers system integrators and retailers throughout most of the world shipments to distributors were approximately 30 25 and 26 of our disc drive revenue in fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively retail sales in fiscal year 2007 as a percentage of our disc drive revenue was 6 compared to 3 and 2 in fiscal years 2006 and 2005 respectively for fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 approximately 30 30 and 31 respectively of our disc drive revenue came from customers located in north america approximately 27 27 and 28 respectively came from customers located in europe and approximately 43 43 and 41 respectively came from customers located in the far east substantially all of our revenue is denominated in us dollars 

in addition to manufacturing and selling disc drives and branded storage products we provide data storage services for small to medium size businesses including online backup data protection and recovery solutions through evault inc “evault” which we acquired in fiscal year 2007 

 

industry overview 

 

our industry is characterized by several trends that have a material impact on our strategic planning financial condition and results of operations 

 

disc drive industry consolidation 

 

due to the significant challenges posed by the need to continually innovate and improve manufacturing efficiency and because of the increasing amounts of capital and research and development expenditure required the disc drive industry has undergone significant consolidation as disc drive manufacturers and component suppliers merged with other companies or exited the industry through such combinations disc drive manufacturers have also become increasingly vertically integrated our recent acquisition of maxtor corporation “maxtor” in may 2006 is an example of such industry consolidation in march 2007 tdk a disc drive head manufacturer announced its pending acquisition of alps also a disc drive head manufacturer while in june 2007 western digital announced that it is acquiring komag we believe industry consolidation is likely to continue in the disc drive industry through combinations of disc drive manufacturers component manufacturers or both as the technological challenges and the associated levels of required investment grow increasing the competitive necessity of largerscale operations 

 

price erosion 

 

our industry has been characterized by continuous price erosion for disc drive products with comparable capacity performance and feature sets ie “likeforlike products” price erosion for likeforlike products is more pronounced during periods of 

 

  

disc drive manufacturers typically attempt to offset price erosion with an improved mix of disc drive products characterized by higher capacity better performance and additional feature sets andor product cost reductions 

 

we expect that price erosion in our industry will continue for the foreseeable future to remain competitive we believe it will be necessary to continue to reduce our prices as well as introduce new product offerings that utilize advanced technologies prior to that of our competitors to take advantage of potentially higher initial profit margins and reduced cost structure on these new products we have established production facilities in china malaysia singapore and thailand to achieve cost reductions 

 

disc drive industry demand trends 

 

we believe that the disc drive industry is experiencing the following growth trends relative to overall unit demand including 

 

  

 37 

  

  

  

  

  

we believe that for some of the fastest growing applications described above the demand is focused on higher capacity disc drive products 

product life cycles and changing technology 

 

our industry has been characterized by significant advances in technology which have contributed to rapid product life cycles the importance of either being first to market with new products or quickly achieving product cost effectiveness as well as difficulty in recovering research and development expenses also there is a continued need to successfully execute product transitions and new product introductions as factors such as quality reliability and manufacturing yields become of increasing competitive importance 

 

to address the growing demand for higher capacity products the industry is undergoing a transition to perpendicular recording technology which is necessary to achieve continued growth in areal density perpendicular recording technology poses various technological challenges including a complex integration of the recording head the disc recording channel and drive firmware as a system and involves the use of certain precious metals such as ruthenium which has been in limited supply and increasingly expensive 

 

seasonality 

 

the disc drive industry traditionally experiences seasonal variability in demand with higher levels of demand in the second half of the calendar year this seasonality is driven by consumer spending in the backtoschool season from late summer to fall and the traditional holiday shopping season from fall to winter in addition corporate demand is higher during the second half of the calendar year when it budget calendars typically provide for more spending we expect normal industry seasonal patterns of increased demand for the september quarter 

 

recording media 

 

consistent with our expectations that the disc drive industry will continue to consolidate and integrate western digital is in the process of acquiring komag a thirdparty supplier of recording media although this transaction may limit komag’s supply of media to the disc drive industry in the longterm we believe that there is adequate supply to meet currently identified industry demand and that there is enough time to readjust supply chains if needed 

 

raw material constraints 

 

perpendicular recording technology requires more layers and the use of more precious metals and scarce alloys in the sputtering process required to create such layers as a result products utilizing perpendicular recording technology are more sensitive to fluctuations in prices and availability of precious metals and scarce alloys such as platinum and ruthenium as product offerings transition to perpendicular recording technology companies will be required to maintain an increased inventory of these precious metals and scarce alloys 

 

industry supply balance 

 

finally to the extent that the disc drive industry builds product based on expectations of demand that do not materialize the distribution channel may experience an oversupply of products that could lead to increased price erosion the industry excluding seagate exited the june 2007 quarter with what we believe to be less than five weeks of distribution inventory in the desktop channel which is consistent with historical seasonal patterns 

 

seagate overview 

 

we are the leader in the disc drive industry with products that address the enterprise desktop mobile computing and consumer electronics and branded solutions storage markets the seagate 35inch and 25inch disc drive units used in our branded storage products are reported in the desktop and mobile market information respectively we maintain a highly integrated approach to our business by designing and manufacturing a significant portion of the components we view as critical to our products such as readwrite heads and recording media we believe that our control of these key technologies combined with our platform design and manufacturing enable us to achieve product performance timetomarket leadership and manufacturing flexibility which allows us to respond to customers and market opportunities our technology ownership combined with our 

integrated design and manufacturing approach have allowed us to effectively leverage our leadership in traditional computing to enter new markets with only incremental product development and manufacturing costs 

 

maxtor acquisition 

 

during fiscal year 2007 we completed our integration of maxtor including customer and product transitions where we replaced maxtor designed disc drive products with seagate designed disc drive products allowing us to improve our capacity utilization and further lower our cost structure we achieved our goals of retaining a substantial portion of the market share held by maxtor prior to the acquisition we also continued to advance what we believe to be our technology and cost leadership positions maintaining our position in key markets and introducing new products in core markets while developing additional value streams in new and emerging markets 

 

our fiscal year 2007 included maxtor’s operating losses largely recognized during the first half of the fiscal year as we transitioned maxtor products to seagate products and acquisition and integration related charges recognized over the entire fiscal year although we substantially completed the maxtor restructuring and integration activities during the december 2006 quarter certain operating expenses and acquisition related charges continued during the last half of the fiscal year the most significant of which related to the amortization of acquired intangible assets we expect to continue to incur charges the most significant of which are expected to be the amortization of acquired intangible assets 

 

operating performance 

 

 40 

  

  

other factors affecting income — in fiscal year 2007 our operating results were favorably impacted by the elimination of variable performancebased compensation compared to an expense of 163 million recorded in fiscal year 2006 we expect that we will incur expenses related to variable performancebased compensation in fiscal year 2008 our operating results were also favorably impacted by a 359 million tax adjustment that reflected a change to our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report additionally the proceeds of our 15 billion in new longterm debt was used to retire our 8 senior notes previously due 2009 “8 notes” and to buy back shares of our common stock thereby decreasing our outstanding common shares by over 40 million shares interest expense in fiscal year 2007 excluding 19 million in expenses related to the retirement of the 8 notes was approximately 80 million more than in fiscal year 2006 because of additional interest expense related to the 15 billion in new longterm debt and because the debt assumed from the maxtor acquisition represented less than two months of interest in fiscal year 2006 interest expense based on the debt outstanding at the end of fiscal year 2007 will be over 30 million per quarter in fiscal year 2008 

 

seasonality 

 

historically we have exhibited seasonally lower unit demand during the second half of each fiscal year however there were some recent quarters in fiscal year 2005 and fiscal year 2006 in which these seasonal trends were moderated we saw a return to traditional seasonality in fiscal year 2007 for the september 2007 quarter we expect to see demand in the desktop mobile and consumer electronics markets to be seasonally higher than the june 2007 quarter while we expect demand in the enterprise market to be flat to slightly up compared to the june 2007 quarter 

 

recording media 

 

the percentage of our requirements for recording media that we produce internally varies from quarter to quarter we are continuing to expand our media production facilities in singapore and have relocated certain of the acquired maxtor media manufacturing equipment to asia we do not expect our new media facility in singapore to be fully operational until towards the end of fiscal year 2008 our longterm strategy is to externally purchase no more than 15 of total recording media requirements 

 

we purchase approximately 70 of our aluminum substrates for recording media production from third parties we are in the process of adding an aluminum substrate manufacturing facility in johor malaysia which will allow us to decrease our purchases of aluminum substrates from third parties we also purchase all of our glass substrates from third parties mainly in japan which are used to manufacture our disc drives for mobile and small form factor consumer electronics products 

 

recently substantially all of our purchases of recording media and a significant portion of our aluminum substrates from thirdparty suppliers have been sourced from komag which is in the process of being acquired by western digital we are engaged in discussions with other suppliers to ensure supply continuity should komag decrease its supply to us after the closing of the acquisition by western digital

we believe seagate is leading the transition to perpendicular recording technology we are currently shipping perpendicular technology based products for all four major markets and during the june 2007 quarter we shipped over 28 million disc drives that use perpendicular recording technology compared to 17 million disc drives shipped in the immediately preceding quarter we expect that by the end of fiscal year 2008 all of our drive shipments will utilize perpendicular recording technology our products based on perpendicular technology require increased quantities of precious metals like ruthenium which has led to an increase that is likely to continue in the inventory levels for these raw materials the price of ruthenium has increased significantly over the last year and may continue to be volatile in addition ruthenium has at times been difficult to acquire we believe we have adequate supply plans in place to support our expected perpendicular product ramp requirements 

 

investments 

 

in fiscal year 2007 we made 906 million of capital investments 218 million of which occurred in the june 2007 quarter for fiscal year 2008 we expect approximately 900 million in capital investment will be required to continue to proceed with our planned media and substrate capacity expansions in asia and to align capacity additions with current levels of customer demand while we continue to improve our utilization of capital equipment 

 

in january 2007 we completed our acquisition of evault in an all cash transaction valued at approximately 186 million which includes approximately 2 million in acquisition costs as part of our effort to extend our storage solutions offerings 

 

results of operations 

 

we list in the tables below the historical consolidated statements of operations in dollars and as a percentage of revenue for the fiscal years indicated 

 

 

 

 

 

fiscal year 2007 compared to fiscal year 2006 

 

the fiscal year 2007 results include the results of maxtor for the entire year while fiscal year 2006 include the results of maxtor from may 19 2006 to june 30 2006 in connection with the maxtor acquisition we incurred a number of accounting charges and other costs which impacted our earnings for the entire fiscal year 2007 and during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 

 

revenue revenue for fiscal year 2007 was approximately 114 billion up 23 from approximately 92 billion in fiscal year 2006 the increase in revenue from fiscal year 2006 was driven by a 34 increase in the unit volume of disc drives shipped from 1187 million units to 1592 million units principally as a result of the retention of a portion of maxtor’s market share offset by a 9 reduction in our average sales price from 78 to 71 per unit and a weaker than anticipated demand for large capacity 35inch ata disc drives the comparative decrease in average sales price per unit in the period resulted from price erosion that more than offset improved product mix 

 

unit shipments for our products in fiscal year 2007 were as follows 

 

  

we maintain various sales programs aimed at increasing customer demand we exercise judgment in formulating the underlying estimates related to distributor and retail inventory levels sales program participation and customer claims submittals in determining the provision for such programs during fiscal year 2007 sales programs recorded as contra revenue were approximately 9 of our gross revenue compared to 7 of our gross revenue for fiscal year 2006 the increase in sales programs as a percentage of gross revenue from fiscal year 2006 was primarily the result of a higher mix of sales to distributors and retail customers which generally require higher program support than oem sales and to a more aggressive pricing environment pointofsale rebates sales price adjustments and price protection accounted for a substantial portion of the increase in sales programs 

 

cost of revenue cost of revenue for fiscal year 2007 was approximately 92 billion up 30 from approximately 71 billion in fiscal year 2006 principally as a result of the acquisition of maxtor gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2007 was 19 as compared with 23 for fiscal year 2006 

the gross margin percentage decrease from fiscal year 2006 was due to the sale of lower margin maxtor designed products during the first six months of fiscal year 2007 costs and charges related to our acquisition of maxtor during fiscal year 2007 including integration and retention costs of 54 million stockbased compensation of 27 million amortization of existing technology of 150 million and an 18 million accrual for the settlement of customer compensatory claims associated with quality issues related to legacy maxtor products shipped prior to the closing of the maxtor acquisition and an aggressive pricing environment in fiscal year 2007 particularly in the high capacity 35inch and mobile markets in the first half of the year and the low end oem desktop and mobile markets in the second half these effects were partially offset by the elimination of variable performancebased compensation for fiscal year 2007 compared to an expense of 76 million recorded in cost of revenue in fiscal year 2006 

 

product development expense product development expense increased by 99 million or 12 for fiscal year 2007 when compared with fiscal year 2006 the increase in product development expense from fiscal year 2006 was primarily due to increases of 115 million in salaries and benefits resulting from increased staffing levels due in part to the retention of certain maxtor employees and 10 million in stockbased compensation related to the maxtor acquisition 7 million in nonmaxtor stockbased compensation and 4 million in the writeoff of inprocess research and development related to our acquisition of evault partially offset by the elimination of variable performancebased compensation for fiscal year 2007 compared to an expense of 46 million in fiscal year 2006 

 

marketing and administrative expense marketing and administrative expense increased by 142 million or 32 for fiscal year 2007 when compared with fiscal year 2006 the increase in marketing and administrative expense from fiscal year 2006 was primarily due to the recording in our first quarter of a 40 million increase in the provision for doubtful accounts receivable related to esys technologies pte ltd and its related affiliate entities “esys” previously our largest distributor an increase of 86 million in salaries and benefits resulting from increased staffing levels due in part to the retention of certain maxtor employees an increase of 5 million in integration and retention costs related to the maxtor acquisition an increase of 11 million in advertising expense and an increase of 11 million in nonmaxtor stockbased compensation these increases were partially offset by the elimination of variable performancebased compensation for fiscal year 2007 compared to an expense of 41 million in fiscal year 2006 

 

amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles increased by 42 million primarily due to the amortization of intangibles acquired in the maxtor and evault acquisitions 

 

restructuring and other during fiscal year 2007 we recorded restructuring costs of approximately 33 million in connection with our ongoing restructuring activities these costs were primarily a result of a restructuring plan established to continue the alignment of our global workforce with existing and anticipated business requirements primarily in our us and far east operations and asset impairments the restructuring costs were comprised of employee termination costs of approximately 14 million relating to a reduction in our workforce approximately 11 million in charges related to impaired facility improvements and equipment as a result of the alignment plan and approximately 8 million in charges related to impaired other intangibles these restructuring activities are expected to be completed by the end of fiscal year 2008 additionally we reversed 4 million of restructuring accruals relating to the sale of a surplus building impaired in a prior restructuring 

 

net other income expense net other income changed by 103 million from net other income of 50 million in fiscal year 2006 to net other expense of 53 million in fiscal year 2007 the change from fiscal year 2006 was primarily due to an increase in interest expense of 81 million related to our new 15 billion longterm debt issued in september 2006 as well as debt acquired in the maxtor acquisition and expenses of 19 million incurred in october 2006 related to the early retirement of our 8 notes the 15 billion in new longterm debt was used to retire the 8 notes and to buy back shares of our common stock interest expense in fiscal year 2007 excluding the expenses related to the early retirement of the 8 notes was approximately 80 million more than in fiscal year 2006 because of additional interest expense related to the 15 billion in new longterm debt and because the debt assumed from the maxtor acquisition represented less than two months of interest in fiscal year 2006 

 

income taxes we recorded a benefit from income taxes of 352 million for the fiscal year ended june 29 2007 compared to a provision for income taxes of 84 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2006 we are a foreign holding company incorporated in the cayman islands with foreign and us subsidiaries that operate in multiple taxing jurisdictions as a result our worldwide operating income is either subject to varying rates of tax or 

is exempt from tax due to tax holidays or tax incentive programs we operate under in china malaysia singapore switzerland and thailand these tax holidays or incentives are scheduled to expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2020 our provision for income taxes recorded for the fiscal year ended june 29 2007 differs from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying a notional us 35 rate to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i a decrease in our valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets and ii the tax benefit related to the aforementioned tax holidays and tax incentive programs our provision for income taxes recorded for the fiscal year ended june 30 2006 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying a notional us 35 rate to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i the tax benefit related to the aforementioned tax holidays and tax incentive programs ii an increase in our valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets and iii utilization of research tax credits generated in the current year 

 

based on our foreign ownership structure and subject to i potential future increases in our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and ii limitations imposed by internal revenue code section 382 “irc section 382” on usage of certain tax attributes further described below we anticipate that our effective tax rate in future periods will generally be less than the us federal statutory rate dividend distributions received from our us subsidiaries may be subject to us withholding taxes when and if distributed deferred tax liabilities have not been recorded on unremitted earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries as these earnings will not be subject to tax in the cayman islands or us federal income tax if remitted to our foreign parent holding company 

 

during fiscal year ended june 29 2007 we reduced our valuation allowance recorded in prior years for our deferred tax assets by 641 million this release of valuation allowance was largely due to the completion during fiscal 2007 of the restructuring of our intercompany arrangements which enabled us to forecast our us profits with greater certainty and the recording of a us taxable gain in connection with the intercompany sale of certain maxtor intangible assets as described below as a result of the valuation allowance release we recorded a us deferred tax benefit of 319 million and a 322 million reduction in the goodwill originally recorded in connection with the maxtor acquisition the reduction in goodwill was required in accordance with financial accounting standards board “fasb” statement “sfas” no 109 accounting for income taxes “sfas no 109” as a result of the reversal of valuation allowance that had been previously recorded as of the date of acquisition against maxtor related deferred tax assets primarily for tax net operating loss carryovers the valuation allowance was reduced primarily to reflect the realization of acquired maxtor net operating loss carryforwards due to increased forecasts of future us taxable income and a 296 million gain for us tax purposes from the intercompany sale of certain intellectual property rights to a foreign subsidiary approximately 120 million of tax expense associated with the gain on the intercompany sale of intangibles has been capitalized in accordance with accounting research bulletin no 51 consolidated financial statements “arb no 51” and is being amortized to income tax expense over a sixtymonth period which approximates the expected useful life of the intangibles sold in the intercompany transaction 

 

as of june 29 2007 we recorded net deferred tax assets of 768 million the realization of 663 million of which is primarily dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods although realization is not assured we believe that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable however may increase or decrease in subsequent quarters when we reevaluate our estimates of future taxable income 

 

as a result of the maxtor acquisition maxtor underwent a change in ownership within the meaning of irc section 382 on may 19 2006 in general irc section 382 places annual limitations on the use of certain tax attributes such as net operating losses and tax credit carryovers in existence at the ownership change date as of june 29 2007 14 billion and 337 million of us federal and state net operating losses respectively and 47 million of tax credit carryovers acquired from maxtor are generally subject to an annual limitation of approximately 110 million certain amounts may be accelerated into the first five years following the acquisition pursuant to irc section 382 and published notices 

 

on january 3 2005 we underwent a change in ownership under irc section 382 due to the sale of common shares to the public by our then largest shareholder new sac based on an independent valuation as of january 3 2005 the annual limitation for this change is 448 million as of june 29 2007 there were 447 million of us net operating loss carryforwards and 111 million of us tax credit carryforwards subject to irc section 382 

limitation associated with the january 3 2005 change to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets associated with tax attributes subject to this irc section 382 limitation will not be realized a valuation allowance has been provided 

 

the internal revenue service “irs” is currently examining our federal income tax returns for fiscal years ending in 2001 through 2004 the timing of the settlement of these examinations is uncertain we believe that adequate amounts of tax have been provided for any final assessments that may result 

 

fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005 

 

the fiscal year 2006 results include the results of maxtor for the six weeks from the closing date of the acquisition of may 19 2006 through june 30 2006 in connection with the maxtor acquisition we incurred a number of accounting charges and other costs which impacted our earnings for the last quarter of and the entire fiscal year 2006 

 

revenue revenue for fiscal year 2006 was approximately 92 billion up 22 from approximately 76 billion in fiscal year 2005 the increase in revenue was primarily due to record disc drive shipments of 1187 million units in fiscal year 2006 compared to 981 million units in fiscal year 2005 as well as an improved product mix of our new products offset by price erosion our overall average sales price per unit asp for our products was 78 for fiscal year 2006 up from 77 in fiscal year 2005 

 

unit shipments for our products in fiscal year 2006 were as follows 

 

  

we maintained various sales programs aimed at increasing customer demand we exercise judgment in formulating the underlying estimates related to distributor inventory levels sales program participation and customer claims submittals in determining the provision for such programs during fiscal year 2006 sales programs recorded as contra revenue were approximately 7 of our gross revenue compared to 5 of our gross revenue for fiscal year 2005 the increase in sales programs as a percentage of gross revenue was primarily the result of higher price erosion in the distribution channel and growth in retail sales which typically require higher pointofsale rebates 

 

cost of revenue cost of revenue for fiscal year 2006 was approximately 71 billion up 20 from approximately 59 billion in fiscal year 2005 gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2006 was 23 as compared with 22 for fiscal year 2005 the increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue from fiscal year 2005 was primarily due to higher overall unit shipments and an increase mix of new highermargin products partially offset by higher costs associated with new product transitions increased warranty cost and customer service inventory writedowns stockbased compensation costs price erosion and in connection with the maxtor acquisition an increasingly underutilized manufacturing infrastructure required to build maxtordesigned disc drive products and purchase accounting related costs including integration and retention costs stockbased compensation and amortization of existing technology 

 

product development expense product development expense increased by 160 million or 25 for fiscal year 2006 when compared with fiscal year 2005 the increase in product development expense from fiscal year 2005 was primarily due to increases of 65 million in salaries resulting and benefits from increased staffing levels and variable performancebased compensation 38 million in product development support costs 24 million in stockbased compensation and 28 million in costs related to the maxtor acquisition including integration and retention costs and stockbased compensation

restructuring during fiscal year 2006 we recorded restructuring costs of approximately 4 million in connection with our ongoing restructuring activities these costs were related to a restructuring plan established to continue the alignment of our global workforce with existing and anticipated business requirements in our far east operations the restructuring costs were comprised of employee termination costs relating to a continuing effort to optimize our production around the world we have substantially completed these restructuring activities 

 

in connection with the maxtor acquisition we accrued certain exit costs aggregating 251 million all of which increased goodwill and did not impact our operating results see note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report 

 

net other income expense net other income increased by 40 million for fiscal year 2006 when compared with fiscal year 2005 the change from fiscal year 2005 was primarily due to an increase in interest income of 33 million resulting from higher average interest rates and higher average balances in our interest bearing accounts and a decrease in interest expense of 7 million resulting from the pay off of a term loan in fiscal year 2006 

 

income taxes we recorded a provision for income taxes of 84 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2006 compared to a provision for income taxes of 25 million for the fiscal year ended july 1 2005 we are a foreign holding company incorporated in the cayman islands with foreign and us subsidiaries that operate in multiple taxing jurisdictions as a result our worldwide operating income is either subject to varying rates of tax or is exempt from tax due to tax holidays or tax incentive programs we operate under in china malaysia singapore switzerland and thailand these tax holidays or incentives are scheduled to expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2015 our provision for income taxes recorded for the fiscal year ended june 30 2006 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying a notional us 35 rate to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i the tax benefit related to the aforementioned tax holidays and tax incentive programs ii an increase in our valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets and iii utilization of research tax credits generated in the current year our provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended july 1 2005 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying a notional us 35 rate to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i the tax benefit related to the aforementioned tax holidays and tax incentive programs ii an increase in our valuation allowance for certain foreign deferred income tax assets iii a tax benefit related to a reduction in previously accrued foreign income taxes and iv utilization of research tax credits generated in that year based on our foreign ownership structure and subject to i potential future increases in our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets ii limitations imposed by internal revenue code section 382 on usage of certain tax attributes further described below and iii use of tax attributes acquired from maxtor and other acquisitions for which a valuation allowance has initially been recognized that if reversed will be reversed to goodwill we anticipate that our effective tax rate in future periods will generally be less than the us federal statutory rate dividend distributions received from our us subsidiaries may be subject to us withholding taxes when and if distributed deferred tax liabilities were not recorded on unremitted earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries as these earnings will not be subject to tax in the cayman islands or us federal income tax if remitted to our foreign parent holding company 

 

as of june 30 2006 we had recorded net deferred tax assets of 78 million the realization of which was primarily dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income in fiscal years 2007 and 2008 although realization is not assured we believe that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable however may increase or decrease in subsequent quarters when we reevaluate our estimates of future taxable income 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

the following is a discussion of our principal liquidity requirements and capital resources 

we had approximately 11 billion in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments at june 29 2007 which includes 988 million of cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents increased by 78 million during fiscal year 2007 this increase in cash and cash equivalents during fiscal year 2007 was primarily attributable to net proceeds received from the issuance of longterm debt totaling approximately 15 billion cash provided by operating activities and maturities and sales of shortterm investments in excess of purchases of shortterm investments substantially offset by capital expenditures the redemption of our 8 notes the repurchase of our common shares and the acquisition of evault

cash used in investing activities 

 

during fiscal year 2007 we used 402 million for net cash investing activities which was primarily attributable to expenditures for property equipment and leasehold improvements of approximately 906 million and 178 million net of cash acquired for the acquisition of evault partially offset by 675 million of maturities and sales of shortterm investments in excess of purchases of shortterm investments the approximately 906 million we invested in property equipment and leasehold improvements was comprised of 

 

  

net cash used in investing activities was approximately 561 million for fiscal year 2006 and was primarily attributable to expenditures for property equipment and leasehold improvements partially offset by the maturities 

and sales of shortterm investments in excess of purchases thereof as well as net cash acquired from maxtor specifically during fiscal year 2006 we invested approximately 10 billion in property equipment and leasehold improvements comprised of 

 

  

net cash used in investing activities was approximately 11 billion for fiscal year 2005 and was primarily attributable to expenditures for property equipment and leasehold improvements and the purchases of shortterm investments in excess of maturities and sales thereof 

 

the increase in the investment in property equipment and leasehold improvements during fiscal years 2007 and 2006 as compared with fiscal year 2005 was for increased capacity to support increased unit shipments and additional capacity for the rampup and production of seagatedesigned disc drive products to replace legacy maxtordesigned products for fiscal year 2008 we expect approximately 900 million in capital investment will be required to continue to proceed with our planned media and substrate capacity expansions in asia and to align capacity additions with current levels of customer demand while we continue to improve our utilization of capital equipment 

 

cash used in financing activities 

 

net cash used in financing activities of 463 million for fiscal year 2007 was primarily attributable to approximately 15 billion used for the repurchases of our common shares 416 million used in the redemption of our 8 notes and 212 million of dividends paid to our shareholders largely offset by approximately 15 billion received from the issuance of longterm debt and 219 million cash provided by employee stock option exercises and employee stock purchases

liquidity sources and cash requirements and commitments 

 

our principal sources of liquidity as of june 29 2007 consisted of 1 approximately 11 billion in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments 2 cash we expect to generate from operations and 3 a 500 million revolving credit facility 

 

our 500 million revolving credit facility matures in september 2011 the 500 million revolving facility which we entered into in september 2006 replaced our previous 100 million revolving credit facility the 500 million revolving credit facility is available for cash borrowings and for the issuance of letters of credit up to a sublimit of 100 million although no borrowings have been drawn under this revolving credit facility to date we had utilized 47 million for outstanding letters of credit and bankers’ guarantees as of june 29 2007 leaving 453 million for additional borrowings subject to compliance with financial covenants and other customary conditions to borrowing 

the credit agreement that governs our revolving credit facility contains covenants that we must satisfy in order to remain in compliance with the agreement this credit agreement contains three financial covenants 1 minimum cash cash equivalents and marketable securities 2 a fixed charge coverage ratio and 3 a net leverage ratio as of june 29 2007 we are in compliance with all covenants including the financial ratios that we are required to maintain 

 

in october 2006 we used 416 million of the net proceeds from the september 2006 issuance of 15 billion debt to redeem the 400 million principal amount of our 8 notes and pay a 16 million redemption premium 

 

our principal liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital research and development capital expenditure needs and to service our debt in addition since the second half of fiscal year 2002 and through the june 2007 quarter we have paid dividends to our shareholders 

 

on september 1 2006 november 17 2006 february 16 2007 and may 18 2007 we paid dividends aggregating approximately 212 million or 038 per share to our common shareholders of record as of august 18 2006 november 3 2006 february 2 2007 and may 4 2007 on july 19 2007 we declared a quarterly dividend of 010 per share that will be paid on or before august 17 2007 to our common shareholders of record as of august 3 2007 in deciding whether or not to declare quarterly dividends our directors will take into account such factors as general business conditions within the disc drive industry our financial results our capital requirements contractual and legal restrictions on the payment of dividends by our subsidiaries to us or by us to our shareholders the impact of paying dividends on our credit ratings and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant 

 

because we had current earnings and profits in excess of distributions for our taxable year ended june 29 2007 distributions on our common shares to us shareholders during this period were treated as dividend income for us federal income tax purposes we anticipate that we will have earnings and profits in excess of distributions in fiscal year 2008 therefore distributions to us shareholders in fiscal year 2008 are anticipated to be treated as dividend income for us federal income tax purposes nonus shareholders should consult with a tax advisor to determine appropriate tax treatment 

 

as a result of the acquisition of maxtor we assumed all of maxtor’s outstanding debts including without limitation its outstanding convertible senior notes maxtor’s 2375 convertible senior notes due august 2012 the “2375 notes of which 326 million were outstanding as of june 29 2007 contain a cash conversion feature that will require seagate to deliver the holders upon any conversion of these notes cash in an amount equal to the lesser of a the principal amount of the notes converted and b the asconverted value of the notes to the extent holders of the maxtor notes choose to convert their notes seagate will require additional amounts of cash to meet this obligation the payment of dividends to holders of our common shares may in certain future quarters result in upward adjustments to the conversion rate of the 2375 notes 

 

on january 26 2007 we completed our acquisition of evault a privately held provider of online backup services in an all cash transaction valued at approximately 178 million net of cash acquired 

 

on august 8 2006 we announced that our board of directors had authorized the use of up to 25 billion for the repurchase of our outstanding common shares over a twoyear period from the authorization of this repurchase program and through the fiscal year ended june 29 2007 we repurchased approximately 620 million shares at an average price of 2462 all of which were considered cancelled and are no longer outstanding we repurchased these shares through a combination of open market purchases and prepaid forward agreements with large financial institutions according to which we prepaid the financial institutions a fixed amount to deliver a variable number of shares at future dates we entered into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the volume weighted average price “vwap” of our common shares our policy to date has been to enter into such transactions only when the discount that we receive is higher than the foregone return on our cash prepayment to the financial institution there were no explicit commissions or fees on these prepaid forward agreements under the terms of these agreements there was no requirement for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us these prepaid forward agreements were not derivatives because the company had prepaid all amounts and had no remaining obligation the agreements do not contain an embedded derivative the prepayments were recorded as a reduction to shareholders’ equity when paid and the shares were 

deducted from shares outstanding the agreements require the physical delivery of shares there were no settlement alternatives except in the case of certain defined extraordinary events which are outside the control of seagate and the financial institutions the parameters used to calculate the final number of shares deliverable are the total notional amount of the contract and the average vwap of our common shares during the contract period less the agreed upon discount the contracts are indexed solely to the price of seagate’s common shares 

 

during fiscal year 2007 we repurchased 243 million shares through open market repurchases in addition we made payments totaling 950 million under prepaid forward agreements and took delivery of 377 million shares using prepaid forward agreements shares physically delivered to us were cancelled and are no longer outstanding at june 29 2007 there were no outstanding prepaid forward agreements to repurchase our common shares 

 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 we repurchased 167 million shares under a previously authorized stock repurchase program the program authorizing repurchases in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 was completed and there is no outstanding authority for further shares to be purchased under that program 

 

in addition as part of our strategy we may selectively pursue strategic alliances acquisitions and investments that are complementary to our business any material future acquisitions alliances or investments will likely require additional capital we may enter into more of these types of arrangements in the future which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all we will require substantial amounts of cash to fund scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness future capital expenditures any increased working capital requirements and share repurchases if we are unable to meet our cash requirements out of existing cash or cash flow from operations we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain alternative financing on terms acceptable to us if at all 

 

we believe that our sources of cash will be sufficient to fund our operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months our ability to fund these requirements and comply with the financial covenants under our debt agreements will depend on our future operations performance and cash flow and is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial business and other factors some of which are beyond our control

the methods estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements the sec has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are highly uncertain at the time of estimation based on this definition our most critical policies include establishment of sales program accruals establishment of warranty accruals valuation of deferred tax assets as well as the valuation of intangibles and goodwill below we discuss these policies further as well as the estimates and judgments involved we also have other key accounting policies and accounting estimates relating to uncollectible customer accounts valuation of inventory valuation of sharebased payments and acquisition related restructuring we believe that these other accounting policies and accounting estimates either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective or it is less likely that they would have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period 

 

establishment of sales program accruals we establish certain distributor and oem sales programs aimed at increasing customer demand for the distribution channel these programs typically involve rebates related to a distributor’s level of sales order size advertising or point of sale activity and price protection adjustments for oem sales rebates are typically based on an oem customer’s volume of purchases from seagate or other agreed upon rebate programs we provide for these obligations at the time that revenue is recorded based on estimated requirements we estimate these contrarevenue rebates and adjustments based on various factors including price reductions during the period reported estimated future price erosion customer orders distributor sellthrough and inventory levels program participation customer claim submittals and sales returns our estimates reflect contractual arrangements but also our judgment relating to variables such as customer claim rates and attainment of program goals and inventory and sellthrough levels reported by our distribution customers 

 

while we believe we have sufficient experience and knowledge of the market and customer buying patterns to reasonably estimate such rebates and adjustments actual market conditions or customer behavior could differ from our expectations as a result actual payments under these programs which may spread over several months after the related sale may vary from the amount accrued accordingly revenues and margins in the period in which the adjustment occurs may be affected for example if the pricing environment is more favorable than we anticipated as it was in the quarter ended december 2006 accruals for forward price protection may be higher than needed conversely in the more severely pricecompetitive second half of fiscal year 2007 utilization of special price adjustments was higher than expected in addition during periods in which our distributors’ inventories of our products are at higher than historical levels our contrarevenue estimates are subject to a greater degree of subjectivity and the potential for actual results to vary is accordingly higher currently our distributors’ inventories are within the historical range 

 

significant actual variations in any of the factors upon which we base our contrarevenue estimates could have a material effect on our operating results since fiscal year 2005 total sales programs have ranged from 5 to 9 of gross revenues due to the competitive pricing environment in our industry sales programs as a percentage of gross revenue may increase from the current range if such rebates and incentives trend upwards revenues and margins will be reduced adjustments to revenues due to under or over accruals for sales programs related to revenues reported in prior periods have averaged 03 of quarterly gross revenue throughout fiscal years 2006 and 2007 

in addition our failure to accurately predict the level of future sales returns by our distribution customers could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

establishment of warranty accruals we estimate probable product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized we generally warrant our products for a period of one to five years our warranty provision considers estimated product failure rates and trends including the timing of product returns during the warranty periods estimated repair or replacement costs and estimated costs for customer compensatory claims related to product quality issues if any we use a statistical model to help with our estimates and we exercise considerable judgment in determining the underlying estimates should actual experience in any future period differ significantly from our estimates or should the rate of future product technological advancements fail to keep pace with the past our future results of operations could be materially affected our judgment is subject to a greater degree of subjectivity with respect to newly introduced products and legacy maxtor designed products because of limited experience with those products upon which to base our warranty estimates we continually introduce new products and have recently begun a shift to disc drive products that utilize perpendicular recording technology 

 

the actual results with regard to warranty expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations if the actual rate of unit failure the cost to repair a unit or the actual cost required to satisfy customer compensatory claims are greater than that which we have used in estimating the warranty accrual since we typically outsource our warranty repairs our repair cost is subject to periodic negotiations with vendors and may vary from our estimates we also exercise judgment in estimating our ability to sell certain repaired disc drives to the extent such sales fall below our forecast warranty cost will be adversely impacted 

 

our warranty cost has ranged from approximately 2 to 3 of revenue over the last three years we review our warranty accrual quarterly for products shipped in prior periods and which are still under warranty any changes in the estimates underlying the accrual may result in adjustments that will impact the current period gross margins and income reestimates of prior warranty accruals have been approximately 1 of revenue or less in fiscal years 2005 2006 and 2007 higher than anticipated failures of specific products as we had in fiscal years 2004 and 2005 and significant increases in repair or replacement costs driven by reduced sales for refurbished products as during the fiscal years 2006 and 2007 have historically been the major reasons for significant reestimates 

 

valuation of deferred tax assets the recording of our deferred tax assets each period depends primarily on our ability to generate current and future taxable income in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions each period we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and we adjust the valuation allowance so that we record net deferred tax assets only to the extent that we conclude it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized significant decreases in projections of taxable income particularly in the united states would likely result in significant increases in our valuation allowance which in turn could adversely impact our effective tax rate with the acquisition of maxtor the realizability of us deferred tax assets was determined on a consolidated return basis as a result maxtor’s deferred tax assets that were determined to be realizable were recorded as a reduction of goodwill and seagate deferred tax assets that were determined to be no longer realizable were written off with a charge to income tax expense at the date of acquisition 

 

valuation of intangible assets and goodwill in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 141 business combinations “sfas no 141” the purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired business based on their estimated fair values with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill we engage thirdparty appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed such valuations require management to make significant judgments estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from existing technology customer relationships trade names and other intangible assets the acquired company’s brand awareness and market position as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company’s product portfolio and discount rates unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results 

we are required to periodically evaluate the carrying values of our intangible assets for impairment if any of our intangible assets are determined to be impaired we may have to write down the impaired asset and our earnings would be adversely impacted in the period that occurs 

 

at june 29 2007 our goodwill totaled approximately 23 billion and our identifiable other intangible assets totaled 188 million in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets “sfas no 142” we assess the impairment of goodwill at least annually or more often if warranted by events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying value may exceed its fair value this assessment may require the projection and discounting of cash flows analysis of our market capitalization and estimating the fair values of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities estimates of cash flow are based upon among other things certain assumptions about expected future operating performance judgment is also exercised in determining an appropriate discount rate our estimates of discounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to among other things economic conditions changes to the business model or changes in operating performance significant differences between these estimates and actual cash flows could materially affect our future financial results 

 

recent accounting pronouncements 

 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities — including an amendment of fasb statement no 115 “sfas no 159” sfas no 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be recognized in earnings at each subsequent reporting date sfas no 159 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 we are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of sfas no 159 will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 158 employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans — an amendment of fasb no 87 88 106 and 132r “sfas no 158” sfas no 158 requires that the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans be recognized on a company’s balance sheet and changes in the funded status be reflected in comprehensive income effective fiscal years ending after december 15 2006 which we adopted in our fiscal year ended june 29 2007 and did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition sfas no 158 also requires companies to measure the funded status of the plan as of the date of its fiscal yearend effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2008 we expect to adopt the measurement provisions of sfas no 158 in our fiscal year 2010 effective june 30 2009 we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 158 to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 fair value measurements “sfas no 157” which defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements this statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements the fasb having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute accordingly this statement does not require any new fair value measurements however for some entities the application of this statement will change current practice sfas no 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas no 157 will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

 

in june 2006 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no fin 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 “fin no 48” this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 109 this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 and will be adopted by us in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008 we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of fin no 48 will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

in february 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 155 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments “sfas no 155” which amends sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities “sfas no 133” and sfas no 140 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities “sfas no 140” sfas no 155 simplifies the accounting for certain derivatives embedded in other financial instruments by allowing them to be accounted for as a whole if the holder elects to account for the entire instrument on a fair value basis sfas no 155 also clarifies and amends certain other provisions of sfas no 133 and sfas no 140 sfas no 155 is effective for all financial instruments acquired issued or subject to a remeasurement event occurring in fiscal years beginning after september 15 2006 earlier adoption is permitted provided the company has not yet issued financial statements including for interim periods for that fiscal year we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 155 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

in july 2007 the fasb agreed to issue for comment a proposed fasb staff position fsp addressing convertible instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including those that may require partial cash settlement the proposed fsp would require the issuer to separately account for the liability and equity components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer’s economics interests the proposed fsp would require bifurcation of a component of the debt classification of that component in equity with the accretion of the discount on the debt resulting in the “economic interest cost” being reflected in the statement of operations through higher interest expense the proposed fsp if issued would be effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2007 and would be applied retrospectively to all periods presented pursuant to the guidance of sfas no 154 accounting changes and error corrections “sfas no 154” our accounting for the 2375 notes acquired from maxtor and therefore our financial position and results of operations may be impacted by the proposed fsp we will evaluate the impact of the final fsp on our financial position and results of operations when issued 

 

  

interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and longterm debt we currently do not use derivative financial instruments in either our investment portfolio or to hedge debt 

 

as stated in our investment policy we are averse to principal loss and ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk we mitigate default risk by maintaining portfolio investments in diversified highquality investment grade securities with limited time to maturity we constantly monitor our investment portfolio and position our portfolio to respond appropriately to a reduction in credit rating of any investment issuer guarantor or depository we maintain a highly liquid portfolio by investing only in marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets 

 

we have both fixed and variable rate debt obligations we enter into debt obligations to support general corporate purposes including capital expenditures and working capital needs we currently do not use interest rate derivatives to hedge our interest rate exposure 

 

at june 29 2007 we had 23 million in marketable securities that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for a period greater than twelve months the unrealized loss on these marketable securities was immaterial 

 

the table below presents principal or notional amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio and debt obligations as of june 29 2007 all investments mature in three years or less included in long term debt for fiscal year 2008 is the principal amount of 326 million related to our 2375 notes which is payable upon the conversion of the 2375 notes which are currently convertible as the company’s share price was in excess of 110 of the conversion price for at least 20 consecutive trading days during the last 30 trading days of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 unless earlier converted the 2375 notes must be redeemed in august 2012 

 

 

 

foreign currency exchange risk we transact business in various foreign countries our primary foreign currency cash flows are in countries where we have a manufacturing presence we have established a foreign currency hedging program to protect against the increase in value of foreign currency cash flows resulting from operating and capital expenditures over the next year we hedge portions of our forecasted expenses denominated in foreign currencies with forward exchange contracts when the us dollar weakens significantly against the foreign currencies the increase in the value of the future foreign currency expenditure is offset by gains in the value of the forward contracts designated as hedges conversely as the us dollar strengthens the decrease in value of the future foreign currency cash flows is offset by losses in the value of the forward contracts these forward foreign exchange contracts carried at fair value may have maturities of up to twelve months additionally in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 we entered into forward contracts to hedge the capital expense costs associated with a new manufacturing facility under construction in malaysia 

 

we evaluate hedging effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively and record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in other income expense on the statement of operations we did not have any net gains losses recognized in other income expense for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness in fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 

 

as of june 29 2007 our notional fair values of foreign exchange forward contracts totaled 148 million we do not believe that these derivatives present significant credit risks because the counterparties to the derivatives consist of major financial institutions and we manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with any one counterparty we maintain limits on maximum tenor of contracts based on the credit rating of the financial institutions we do not enter derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes the table below provides information as of june 29 2007 about our derivative financial instruments comprised of foreign currency forward exchange contracts the table is provided in us dollar equivalent amounts and presents the notional amounts at the contract exchange rates and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates

 item 1 business 

  

we are the leader in the design manufacturing and marketing of rigid disc drives rigid disc drives which are commonly referred to as disc drives or hard drives are used as the primary medium for storing electronic information in systems ranging from desktop and notebook computers and consumer electronics devices to data centers delivering information over corporate networks and the internet we produce a broad range of disc drive products that make us the leader in the industry with products addressing enterprise applications where our products are used in enterprise servers mainframes and workstations desktop applications where our products are used in desktop computers mobile computing applications where our products are used in notebook computers and consumer electronics applications where our products are used in a wide variety of devices such as digital video recorders digital music players and gaming devices 

  

we sell our disc drives primarily to major original equipment manufacturers or oems and also market to distributors under our globally recognized brand name for fiscal years 2006 2005 and 2004 approximately 72 72 and 64 respectively of our disc drive revenue was from sales to oems including customers such as hewlettpackard dell emc microsoft and ibm we have longstanding relationships with many of these oem customers we also have key relationships with major distributors who sell our disc drive products to small oems dealers system integrators and retailers throughout most of the world also we are currently expanding our direct sales to retailers for fiscal years 2006 2005 and 2004 approximately 30 31 and 29 respectively of our disc drive revenue came from customers located in north america approximately 27 28 and 33 respectively came from customers located in europe and approximately 43 41 and 38 respectively came from customers located in the far east substantially all of our revenue is denominated in us dollars 

  

acquisition of maxtor corporation 

  

on may 19 2006 we acquired maxtor corporation in a stock for stock transaction we expect the acquisition of maxtor to build on our foundation as the leading global disc drive company leveraging the strength of our significant operating scale to drive product innovation and maximize operational efficiencies we believe the combined company will be wellpositioned to accelerate delivery of a diverse set of compelling and costeffective solutions to the growing customer base for data storage products 

  

the acquisition provides us with enhanced scale greater capacity and an increased customer base which we expect will allow us to eventually achieve significant cost synergies from leveraging our research and development platform reducing product and supply chain costs as well as scaling our sales marketing and administrative infrastructure we also acquired a final assembly and test manufacturing facility in suzhou china significantly increasing our chinabased manufacturing presence as well as the retail and branded solutions 

  

operations of maxtor and the right to use the maxtor brand and other related trade names the acquisition has also provided us access to talented personnel in the branded solution product development and other key functional areas 

  

we are engaged in integration and restructuring processes whereby we are driving to replace maxtordesigned disc drive products with seagatedesigned disc drive products we expect this process to be substantially complete by the end of calendar year 2006 we foresee there to be a transitional period through the first six months of fiscal year 2007 during which we expect the inefficient use of the maxtor manufacturing infrastructure as we wind down the volume of maxtordesigned disc drive products and incur upfront investment needed for capacity additions to support the rampup of seagatedesigned disc drive products in addition work force reductions took place after the transaction closed as we addressed the redundancies that exists between the two companies and will continue to be implemented based on production transitions customer support and administrative requirements 

  

industry 

  

demand for electronic data storage 

  

we believe that the amount of data stored and accessed electronically is growing rapidly and that there are a number of key factors driving this demand we are particularly focused on three areas of growing demand for disc drives 

  

growth in disc drives for consumer electronics  highperformance computing and communications functions and increasingly disc drives are being incorporated into consumer electronics devices such as digital video recorders digital music players video game consoles and advanced television settop boxes in addition faster connections to the internet and increased broadband capacity have encouraged consumers to download greater amounts of text video and audio data expanding the market for disc drives for use in new consumer and entertainment appliances the adoption and rapid growth of the use of disc drives in these applications will be facilitated by the development of lowcost disc drives that meet the pricing requirements of the consumer electronics market 

  

growth in disc drives for mobile computing the mobile computing market is expected to grow faster than any other personal computer segment as price and performance continue to improve placing notebook computers in an attractive position relative to desktop computers notebook systems are increasingly becoming replacement systems to desktop computers and progressively more desirable to consumers as the need for mobility increases and wireless adoption continues to advance 

  

growth of storage area networks and network attached storage  the need to address the dramatic expansion in data storage management requirements has spurred the evolution of new storage and data management technologies enterprises are increasingly offloading network traffic to dedicated storage area networks or sans in addition many enterprises are moving away from the use of serverattached storage to networkattached storage or nas these solutions combine highperformance storage products that are comprised principally of disc drives with sophisticated software and communications technologies we expect that the market for these solutions will grow rapidly and will result in greater opportunities for the sale of highperformance highcapacity disc drives 

  

an emerging application in enterprise storage is the use of business critical storage systems these systems use higher capacity disc drives to access less frequently needed data that historically have been addressed by tape or other backup and archival technologies 

  

success in our industry depends on technology and manufacturing leadership 

  

the design and manufacturing of disc drives depends on highly advanced technology and manufacturing techniques especially in the areas of readwrite heads and recording media disc drive manufacturers are distinguished by their level of integration which is the degree to which they control the technology used in their products and by whether they are captive producing disc drives for their own computer systems or independent producing disc drives as a standalone product integrated manufacturers are companies that design and produce the critical technologies including readwrite heads and recording media used in their disc drives an integrated approach enables them to lower manufacturing costs and to improve the functionality of components so that they work together efficiently in contrast manufacturers that are not integrated purchase most of their components from thirdparty suppliers upon whom they depend for key elements of their technological innovation and differentiation this can limit their ability to coordinate technology roadmaps and optimize the component design process for manufacturing efficiency and product reliability while making them reliant on the technology investment decisions of their suppliers independent manufacturers can enjoy a competitive advantage over captive manufacturers in working with oems because they do not compete with oems for computer system sales 

  

due to the significant challenges posed by the need to continually innovate and improve manufacturing efficiency the disc drive industry has undergone significant consolidation as manufacturers and merchant component suppliers merged with other companies or exited the industry consolidation is likely to continue in our industry as the technological challenges and the associated levels of required investment grow increasing the competitive necessity of largescale operations we believe the competitive dynamics of the disc drive industry favor integrated independent manufacturers with the scale to make substantial technology investments and apply them across a broad product portfolio and set of customers 

  

overview of disc drive technology 

  

all disc drives incorporate the same basic technology although individual products vary one or more discs are attached to a spindle assembly powered by a spindle motor that rotates the discs at a high constant speed around a hub the discs or recording media are the components on which data is stored and from which it is retrieved each disc typically consists of a substrate of finely machined aluminum or glass with a layer of a thinfilm magnetic material readwrite heads mounted on an arm assembly similar in concept to that of a record player fly extremely close to each disc surface and record data on and retrieve it from concentric tracks in the magnetic layers of the rotating discs the readwrite heads are mounted vertically on an eshaped assembly the eblock and the recording media are mounted inside a metal casing called the base casing 

  

upon instructions from the drive’s electronic circuitry a head positioning mechanism or actuator guides the heads to the selected track of a disc where the data is recorded or retrieved application specific integrated circuits or asics and ancillary electronic control chips are collectively mounted on printed circuit boards asics move data to and from the readwrite head and the internal controller or interface which communicates with the host computer disc drive manufacturers typically use one or more of several industry standard interfaces such as advanced technology architecture or ata serial ata or sata which provides higher data transfer rates than the previous ata standard small computer system interface or scsi serial attached scsi or sas and fibre channel 

  

disc drive performance is commonly assessed by six key characteristics 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

areal density is a measure of storage capacity per square inch on the recording surface of a disc current areal densities are sufficient to meet the requirements of most applications today although the rate of increase in areal density is slowing we expect the longterm demand for increased drive capacities to continue to increase as audio and visual data require many multiples of the storage capacity of simple text we have pursued and expect to continue to pursue a range of technologies to increase areal densities across the entire range of our products to increase disc drive capacities and to enable the production of higher capacity smaller form factor disc drives for example the disc drive industry is undergoing a shift from longitudinal to perpendicular recording technology in which data bits are oriented vertically on the disc platter perpendicular to the disc surface rather than flat to the surface in order to increase areal density and capacity as a result of the transition to perpendicular recording technology there is a need to increase the thickness of the recording materials and increase the complexity of the readwrite head technology furthermore perpendicular recording technology requires a complex interplay between the readwrite heads the recording media the asics and the disc drive software 

  

manufacturing 

  

we pursue an integrated business strategy based on the ownership of critical component technologies this strategy allows us to maintain control over our product roadmap and component cost quality and availability our manufacturing efficiency and flexibility is a critical element of our integrated business strategy we continuously seek to improve our manufacturing efficiency by 

  

   

   

   

   

   

manufacturing our disc drives is a complex process that begins with the production of individual components and ends with a fully assembled unit we design assemble andor manufacture a number of the most important components found in our disc drives including readwrite heads recording media printed circuit boards and spindle motors 

  

we believe that because of our vertical design and manufacturing strategy we are well suited to meet the challenges posed by the close interdependence of components for disc drives which is especially critical in the design and production of products incorporating perpendicular recording technology 

  

readwrite heads  the function of the readwrite head is to scan across the disc as it spins magnetically recording or reading information the tolerances of recording heads are extremely demanding and require stateoftheart equipment and processes our readwrite heads are manufactured with thinfilm and photolithographic processes similar to those used to produce semiconductor integrated circuits beginning with 

  

sixinch round ceramic wafers we process more than 25000 head elements at one time each of these head elements goes through more than 300 steps all in clean room environments our readwrite heads require highly advanced processes with tolerances approaching the thickness of a single atom we perform all primary stages of design and manufacture of readwrite heads at our facilities although the percentage of our requirements for readwrite heads that we produce internally varies periodically we currently manufacture all of our readwrite heads with perpendicular recording technology in the process of replacing longitudinal recording technology the tolerances and complexity of recording heads are becoming even more demanding because perpendicular recording technology utilizes existing capital equipment to manufacture readwrite heads additional capital investments will be driven primarily by volume 

  

recording media the function of the recording media is to magnetically store information the domains where each bit of magnetic code is stored are extremely small and precisely placed as a result the manufacturing of recording media requires sophisticated thinfilm processes each disc is a sequentially processed set of sputtered layers that consist of structural magnetic protective and lubricating materials once complete the disc must have a high degree of physical uniformity to assure reliable and errorfree storage 

  

we purchase approximately 50 of our aluminum substrate blanks for recording media production from third parties mainly in japan these blanks are machined plated and polished to produce finished substrates at our plant in northern ireland we also purchase all of our glass substrates from third parties mainly in japan in manufacturing our disc drives used in mobile and small form factor consumer electronics products the percentage of our requirements for recording media that we produce internally varies from quarter to quarter we continue to expand our media production facility in singapore to further increase our production capacity and with the acquisition of maxtor are in a position to relocate maxtor’s media process equipment to asia and further expand our media production in singapore near our current media facility our longterm strategy is to purchase no more than 20 of our recording media requirements from thirdparty suppliers in any given year although the increased thickness of the recording media required by perpendicular recording technology could have a negative effect upon our manufacturing throughput we believe we have compensated for this effect by investing in advanced manufacturing technologies 

  

perpendicular recording technology requires more layers and the use of more precious metals and scarce alloys in the sputtering process required to create such layers as a result products utilizing perpendicular recording technology are more sensitive to fluctuations in prices and availability of precious metals and scarce alloys as our product offerings transition to perpendicular recording technology we may be required to maintain an increased inventory of precious metals and scarce alloys 

  

printed circuit boards  we assemble and test a significant portion of the printed circuit boards used in our disc drives printed circuit boards are the boards that contain the electronic circuitry and asics that provide the electronic controls of the disc drive and on which the headdisc assembly is mounted we assemble printed circuit boards at our facilities in malaysia and china 

  

spindle motors  we participate in the design of many of our spindle motors and purchase them principally from outside vendors in asia whom we have licensed to use our intellectual property and technology 

  

asics  we participate in the design of many of the asics used in our disc drives for motor and actuator control such as interface controllers readwrite channels and preamplifiers we do not manufacture any asics but rather buy them from thirdparty suppliers 

  

disc drive assembly following the production of the individual components of the disc drive the first step in the manufacture of a disc drive itself is the assembly of the actuator arm readwrite heads discs and spindle motor in a housing to form the headdisc assembly the production of the headdisc assembly involves largely automated processes printed circuit boards are then matted to the headdisc assembly and the completed unit is tested prior to packaging and shipment final assembly and test operations of our disc drives occur 

  

primarily at facilities located in china singapore and thailand also through the acquisition of maxtor we have acquired a final assembly and test manufacturing facility in suzhou china significantly increasing our chinabased manufacturing presence we perform subassembly and component manufacturing operations at our facilities in china malaysia northern ireland singapore thailand and in the united states in california and minnesota in addition third parties manufacture and assemble components for us in various asian countries including china japan korea malaysia the philippines singapore taiwan thailand and vietnam and in europe and the united states 

  

products 

  

we offer a broad range of disc drive products for the enterprise desktop mobile computing consumer electronics and branded solutions markets of the disc drive industry while most of our products currently employ longitudinal recording technology we were the first disc drive manufacturer to announce perpendicular recording technology based products for all major markets described below with products shipping for revenue in the desktop enterprise mobile and branded solution markets during fiscal year 2006 we expect that by the end of fiscal year 2007 more than half of our disc drive unit shipments will be perpendicular recording technology based products 

  

we offer more than one product within each product family and differentiate products on the basis of priceperformance and form factor the dimensions of the disc drive or capacity historically our industry has been characterized by continuous and significant advances in technology which has contributed to rapid product life cycles however based upon the recent pace of new product introductions we believe that our industry is currently in a period in which the rate of increases in areal density which is the storage capacity per square inch on a disc is lower than the rate of the last several years resulting in longer product life cycles we list below our main current product offerings

customers 

  

we sell our disc drive products primarily to major oems and distributors oem customers incorporate our disc drives into computer systems storage systems and consumer electronic applications for resale distributors typically sell our disc drives to small oems dealers system integrators and other resellers shipments to oems were approximately 72 72 and 64 of our disc drive revenue in fiscal years 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively shipments to distributors were approximately 25 26 and 35 of our disc drive revenue in fiscal 

  

years 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively sales to hewlettpackard accounted for approximately 17 18 and 19 of our disc drive revenue in fiscal years 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively while sales to dell as a percentage of our disc drive revenue were 11 and 12 in fiscal years 2006 and 2005 respectively no other customer accounted for 10 or more of our disc drive revenue in fiscal years 2006 2005 and 2004 retail sales in fiscal year 2006 as a percentage of our disc drive revenue increased to 3 from 17 and 09 in fiscal years 2005 and 2004 respectively see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and “item 1a risk factors—risks related to our business—dependence on key customers—we may be adversely affected by the loss of or reduced delayed or cancelled purchases by one or more of our larger customers” 

  

oem customers typically enter into master purchase agreements with us these agreements provide for pricing volume discounts order lead times product support obligations and other terms and conditions the term of these agreements is usually 12 to 36 months although our product support obligations generally extend substantially beyond this period these master agreements typically do not commit the customer to buy any minimum quantity of products or create exclusive relationships deliveries are scheduled only after receipt of purchase orders in addition with limited leadtime customers may cancel or defer most purchase orders without significant penalty anticipated orders from many of our customers have in the past failed to materialize or oem delivery schedules have been deferred or altered as a result of changes in their business needs 

  

our distributors generally enter into nonexclusive agreements for the redistribution of our products they typically furnish us with a nonbinding indication of their nearterm requirements and product deliveries are generally scheduled based on a weekly confirmation by the distributor of its requirements for that week the agreements typically provide the distributors with price protection with respect to their inventory of our disc drives at the time of a reduction by us in our selling price for the disc drives and also provide limited rights to return the product 

  

the company has significantly increased its sales to retail customers in the last two years and the recent maxtor acquisition has further expanded our retail customer base retail sales typically require higher marketing support sales incentives and longer price protection periods 

  

we also regularly enter into agreements with our customers which obligate us to provide a limited indemnity against losses resulting from intellectual property claims these agreements are customary in our industry and typically require us to indemnify our customer against certain damages and costs incurred as a result of third party intellectual property claims arising as a result of their use of our products 

  

sales marketing and customer service 

  

our marketing organization works to increase demand for our disc drive products through strategic collaboration with key oem customers and distribution partners to align our respective product roadmaps and to build our brand and endcustomer relationships as customer and markets increasingly demand a broad variety of products with different performance and cost attributes we have recently organized the company’s marketing organization with groups focused on the strategic needs of our increasingly diverse customer base we believe this enables us to serve both our core markets and better identify develop and serve emerging markets 

  

our sales organization focuses on deepening our relationship with our customers the worldwide sales group focuses on geographic coverage of oems and distributors throughout most of the world the worldwide sales group is organized by customer type and regionally among north america japan asiapacific excluding japan and europe africa and the middle east in addition we have a sales operation group which focuses on aligning our production levels with customers’ product requirements our sales force works directly with our marketing organization to coordinate our oem and distribution channel relationships we maintain sales offices throughout the united states and in australia china england france germany india ireland japan singapore and taiwan 

  

with the acquisition of maxtor we acquired the right to the use the maxtor and other related brand names we believe the maxtor brand is a valuable asset in the retail market and distribution channel and we intend to continue to offer the maxtor brand of products to consumers globally to broaden our reach into and coverage of these channels as well as optimize the impact of our marketing investments 

  

our customer service organization maintains a global network of service points to process warranty returns and manage outsourced repair vendors we warrant our products for periods ranging from one year to five years with all internal desktop and notebook disc drives shipped through the distribution and retail channels being warranted for five years 

  

foreign sales are subject to foreign exchange controls and other restrictions including in the case of some countries approval by the office of export administration of the us department of commerce and other us governmental agencies 

  

competition 

  

the disc drive industry is intensely competitive with manufacturers competing for a limited number of major customers some of the principal factors used by customers to differentiate among disc drive manufacturers are storage capacity price per unit and price per gigabyte storageretrieval access times data transfer rates product quality and reliability production volume capability form factor responsiveness to customer preferences and demands warranty and brand 

  

we believe that our products are competitive with respect to each of these factors in the markets that we currently address we summarize below our principal competitors the effect of competition on price erosion for our products and product life cycles and technology 

  

principal competitors  we have experienced and expect to continue to experience intense competition from a number of domestic and foreign companies some of which have greater financial and other resources than we have these competitors include other independent disc drive manufacturers such as western digital as well as large captive manufacturers such as fujitsu hitachi global storage technologies samsung and toshiba because they produce complete computer systems captive manufacturers can derive a greater portion of their operating margins from other components which reduces their need to realize a profit on the disc drives included in their computer systems and allows them to sell disc drives to third parties at very low margins many captive manufacturers are also formidable competitors because they have more substantial resources and greater access to their internal customers than we do in addition hitachi global storage technologies together with affiliated entities and samsung electronics incorporated also sell other products to our customers including critical components like flash memory asics and flat panel displays and may be willing to sell their disc drives at a lower margin to advance their overall business strategy 

  

we also face indirect competition from the large captive manufacturers who continually evaluate whether to manufacture their own disc drives and other information storage products or purchase them from outside sources other than us these manufacturers also sell disc drives to third parties which results in direct competition with us we expect that continued consolidation both among independent manufacturers and among captive manufacturers will increase the threat posed to our business by these competitors during the last few years additional competitors have entered the market including cornice and gs magicstor offering 1inch disc drives and excelstor as a contract manufacturer of desktop disc drives 

  

with respect to our lower capacity smaller form factor disc drives such as our st1 used in handheld consumer electronics devices such as digital music players digital cameras and digital video cameras we have seen increased competition from other companies that produce alternative storage technologies like flash memory 

  

price erosion  our competitors have historically offered new or existing products at lower prices as part of a strategy to gain or retain market share and customers and we expect these practices to continue even during periods when demand for disc drives is growing our industry is price competitive and vendors experience price erosion over the life of a product in addition price erosion may be more pronounced during periods of industry consolidation such as leading up to and after the closing of our acquisition of maxtor price erosion has increased as product life cycles have lengthened due to a slowing in the rate of increase in areal density this slowing of the areal density curve may contribute to increases in average price erosion to the extent that historical price erosion patterns continue product life cycles are lengthened our competitors have more time to enter the market for a particular product and we are unable to offset this with new products at higher average prices we expect that price erosion in our industry will continue for the foreseeable future to remain competitive we believe it will be necessary to continue to reduce our prices as well as introduce new product offerings that utilize advanced technologies prior to that of our competitors to take advantage of potentially higher initial profit margins and reduced cost structure on these product introductions we have established production facilities in china malaysia singapore and thailand to achieve cost reductions 

  

product life cycles and changing technology  historically competition and changing customer preference and demand in the disc drive industry have shortened product life cycles and caused acceleration in the development and introduction of new technology based on the recent pace of new product introductions however we believe that the current rate of increase in areal density is slowing from the rate of the last several years and the resulting variability in product life cycles may make planning for product transitions more critical we believe that our future success will depend upon our ability to develop manufacture and market products of high quality and reliability which meet changing user needs and which successfully anticipate or respond to changes in technology and standards on a costeffective and timely basis it is unclear what impact the industry’s ongoing shift from longitudinal to perpendicular recording technology will have on product life cycles 

  

research and development 

  

we are committed to developing new component technologies and products and evaluating alternative storage technologies we have increased our focus on research and development and realigned our disc drive development process this structured product process is designed to bring new products to market through predictable and repeatable methodologies seagate’s research group which is based in pittsburgh pennsylvania is dedicated to extending the capacity of magnetic and optical recording and exploring alternative data storage technologies including perpendicular recording technology and heat assisted magnetic recording technology perpendicular recording technology involves a different orientation for the magnetic field than is currently used in disc drives and heat assisted magnetic recording technology uses heat generated by a laser to improve storage capacity our advanced technology integration effort focuses disc drive and component research on recording subsystems including readwrite heads and recording media marketspecific product technology as well as technology focused towards new business opportunities the primary purpose of our advanced technology integration effort is to ensure timely availability of mature component technologies to our product development teams as well as allowing us to leverage and coordinate those technologies in the design centers across our products in order to take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace during fiscal years 2006 2005 and 2004 we had product development expenses of 805 million 645 million and 666 million respectively 

  

patents and licenses 

  

as of june 30 2006 we had approximately 3768 us patents and 652 patents issued in various foreign jurisdictions as well as approximately 1228 us and 695 foreign patent applications pending the number of patents and patent applications will vary at any given time as part of our ongoing patent portfolio management activity due to the rapid technological change that characterizes the information storage industry we believe that the improvement of existing products reliance upon trade secret law the protection of unpatented proprietary knowhow and development of new products are generally more important than patent protection in establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage nevertheless we believe that patents are valuable to our 

  

business and intend to continue our efforts to obtain patents where available in connection with our research and development program 

  

the information storage industry is characterized by significant litigation relating to patent and other intellectual property rights because of rapid technological development in the information storage industry some of our products have been and in the future could be alleged to infringe existing patents of third parties from time to time we receive claims that our products infringe patents of third parties although we have been able to resolve some of those claims or potential claims by obtaining licenses or rights under the patents in question without a material adverse effect on us other claims have resulted in adverse decisions or settlements in addition other claims are pending which if resolved unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations for more information on these claims see “item 3 legal proceedings” the costs of engaging in intellectual property litigation may be substantial regardless of the merit of the claim or the outcome we have patent crosslicenses with a number of companies additionally as part of our normal intellectual property practices we are engaged in negotiations with other major disc drive companies and component manufacturers with respect to ongoing patent crosslicenses 

  

backlog 

  

in view of customers’ rights to cancel or defer orders with little or no penalty we believe backlog in the disc drive industry is of limited indicative value in estimating future performance and results 

  

employees 

  

at june 30 2006 we employed approximately 60000 people worldwide of which approximately 46000 employees were located in our asian operations as part of the rampdown of maxtordesigned disc drive products we expect to reduce the number of employees by approximately 5100 in addition we make use of temporary employees principally in manufacturing who are hired on an asneeded basis we believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees at all levels and even then we cannot assure you of any such success we believe that our employee relations are good 

  

environmental matters 

  

our operations are subject to comprehensive us and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites some of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution and these permits are subject to modification renewal and revocation by issuing authorities 

  

we believe that our operations are currently in substantial compliance with all environmental laws regulations and permits we incur operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental laws if additional or more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future we could incur additional operating costs and capital expenditures 

  

some environmental laws such as the us federal superfund law and similar state statutes can impose liability for the cost of cleanup of contaminated sites upon any of the current or former site owners or operators or upon parties who sent waste to these sites regardless of whether the owner or operator owned the site at the time of the release of hazardous substances or the lawfulness of the original disposal activity we have been identified as a potentially responsible party at several superfund sites at each of these sites the government has assigned to us a portion of the financial liability based on the type and amount of hazardous substances disposed of by each party at the site and the number of financially viable parties 

  

some of our current and former sites have a history of commercial and industrial operations including the use of hazardous substances groundwater and soil contamination resulting from historical operations has been identified at several of our current and former facilities and we are addressing the cleanup of these sites in cooperation with the relevant government agencies 

  

while our ultimate costs in connection with these sites is difficult to predict with complete accuracy based on our current estimates of cleanup costs and our expected allocation of these costs we do not expect costs in connection with these superfund sites and contaminated sites to be material

 item 1a   risk factors tableend   

risks related to our business 

  

we expect the integration of seagate and maxtor will result in revenue attrition significant cash expenditures and accounting charges increased capital expenditures and operating inefficiencies that will have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition during fiscal year 2007 and potentially beyond 

  

we expect to experience attrition of maxtor revenue as we complete the integration of maxtor’s business into our operations we will also incur significant cash expenditures and noncash accounting charges in connection with the integration the cash expenditures have been preliminarily estimated to be approximately 500 million and include restructuring and integration activities and retention bonuses in addition to the anticipated cash expenditures we expect significant noncash charges including those associated with the amortization of intangible assets and stockbased compensation which we currently estimate at approximately 385 million approximately 200 million of which is expected to be incurred in the first year following the closing we anticipate that the majority of these cash expenditures and noncash charges will occur in the 12 months following the closing of the merger however the timing of the stockbased compensation charge may be significantly affected by the effect of employee terminations as a result of restructuring activities a substantial portion of the cash expenditures relating to restructuring activities will be recorded as liabilities assumed from maxtor and will increase goodwill while the noncash charges will generally reduce earnings of the company we also anticipate approximately 580 million of incremental capital expenditures as we combine operations in the first 18 to 24 months after the closing during the initial months after the closing of the acquisition as we are winding down the manufacture and sale of maxtordesigned disc drive products and ramping up the manufacture of seagatedesigned disc drive products to meet maxtor’s customers’ demands we also expect to experience operating inefficiencies that will adversely impact our gross margin and operating results as a result of the revenue attrition cash expenditures accounting charges capital expenditures and operating inefficiencies described above our operating results and financial condition have been and will be adversely affected particularly in the first year following the closing of the merger which occurred on may 19 2006 

  

the failure to successfully integrate maxtor’s business into our operations in the expected time frame or at all may adversely affect the company’s future results 

  

we believe that the acquisition of maxtor will result in certain benefits including certain cost synergies and operational efficiencies however to realize these anticipated benefits maxtor’s business must be successfully integrated into seagate’s operations by winding down the manufacture and sale of maxtordesigned disc drive products and transitioning maxtor’s customers to seagate disc drive products the success of the maxtor acquisition will depend on our ability to realize these anticipated benefits from integrating maxtor’s business into our operations we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the maxtor acquisition on a timely basis or at all for a variety of reasons including the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition although we are currently transitioning maxtor’s sales to seagatedesigned disc drive products and expect this transition to be substantially completed by the end of calendar 2006 we cannot assure you that we will be successful with this transition during the contemplated time frames or at all the integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses or delays if the company is not able to successfully integrate maxtor’s business and operations the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected 

  

competition—our industry is highly competitive and our products have experienced and will continue to experience significant price erosion and market share variability which may be even more pronounced in the near term as our competitors seek to increase their market share following our acquisition of maxtor 

  

even during periods when demand is stable the disc drive industry is intensely competitive and vendors typically experience substantial price erosion over the life of a product our competitors have historically offered existing products at lower prices as part of a strategy to gain or retain market share and customers and we expect these practices to continue we will need to continually reduce our prices to retain our market share which could adversely affect our results of operations 

  

we believe this basic industry condition of continuing price erosion and market share variability has been even more acute recently in those markets served by maxtor particularly with respect to desktop disc drives as our competitors engage in aggressive pricing actions targeted to encourage shifting of customer demand as a result the pricing environment in the june 2006 quarter was very competitive and we expect it to remain competitive for the remainder of fiscal year 2007 as our competitors continue these efforts 

  

in addition to the recent pricing activity discussed above based on our recent experience in the industry with respect to new product introductions we believe that the rate of growth in areal density or the storage capacity per square inch on a disc is slowing from its previous levels this trend may contribute to increased average price erosion to the extent that historical price erosion patterns continue product life cycles may lengthen our competitors may have more time to enter the market for a particular product and we may be unable to offset these factors with new product introductions at higher average prices a second general industry trend that may contribute to increased average price erosion is the growth of sales to distributors that serve producers of nonbranded products in the personal storage sector these customers generally have limited product qualification programs which increases the number of competing products available to satisfy their demand as a result purchasing decisions for these customers are based largely on price and terms any increase in our average price erosion would have an adverse effect on our result of operations 

  

additionally a significant portion of our success in the past has been a result of increasing our market share at the expense of our competitors particularly in the notebook and small form factor markets our market share for our products can be negatively affected by our customers’ diversifying their sources of supply as the slowing rate of growth in areal density has resulted in longer product cycles and more time for our competitors to enter the market for particular products when our competitors successfully introduce product offerings which are competitive with our recently introduced new products our customers may quickly diversify their sources of supply we expect market shares to be even more variable in the near term as customers adjust their purchasing practices in reaction to our acquisition of maxtor particularly in those markets served by maxtor any significant decline in our market share would adversely affect our results of operations 

  

principal competitors—we compete with both independent manufacturers whose primary focus is producing technologically advanced disc drives and captive manufacturers who do not depend solely on sales of disc drives to maintain their profitability 

  

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience intense competition from a number of domestic and foreign companies including other independent disc drive manufacturers and large captive manufacturers such as 

  

   

the term “independent” in this context refers to manufacturers that primarily produce disc drives as a standalone product and the term “captive” refers to disc drive manufacturers who themselves or through affiliated entities produce complete computer or other systems that contain disc drives or other information storage products captive manufacturers are formidable competitors because they have the ability to determine pricing for complete systems without regard to the margins on individual components because components other than disc drives generally contribute a greater portion of the operating margin on a complete computer system than do disc drives captive manufacturers do not necessarily need to realize a profit on the disc drives included in a computer system and as a result may be willing to sell disc drives to third parties at very low margins many captive manufacturers are also formidable competitors because they have more substantial resources than we do in addition hitachi global storage technologies together with affiliated entities and samsung electronics incorporated also sell other products to our customers including critical components like flash memory asics and flat panel displays and may be willing to sell their disc drives at a lower margin to advance their overall business strategy this may improve their ability to compete with us to the extent we are not successful competing with captive or independent disc drive manufacturers our results of operations will be adversely affected 

  

in addition in response to customer demand for highquality highvolume and lowcost disc drives manufacturers of disc drives have had to develop large in some cases global production facilities with highly developed technological capabilities and internal controls the development of large production facilities and industry consolidation can contribute to the intensification of competition we also face indirect competition from present and potential customers who evaluate from time to time whether to manufacture their own disc drives or other information storage products 

  

in some emerging consumer applications disc drives smaller than 18inch form factor compete directly with alternative storage technologies such as flash 

  

volatility of quarterly results—our quarterly operating results fluctuate significantly from period to period and this may cause our shares price to decline 

  

in the past our quarterly revenue and operating results have fluctuated significantly from period to period we expect this fluctuation to continue for a variety of reasons including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

as a result we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful and that these comparisons may not be an accurate indicator of our future performance our operating results in one or more future quarters may fail to meet the expectations of investment research analysts or investors which could cause an immediate and significant decline in the trading price of our common shares 

  

new product offerings—market acceptance of new product introductions cannot be accurately predicted and our results of operations will suffer if there is less demand for our new products than is anticipated 

  

we are continually developing new products with the goal that we will be able to introduce technologically advanced and lower cost disc drives into the marketplace ahead of our competitors 

  

the success of our new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors including market acceptance our ability to manage the risks associated with product transitions the effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand and the risk that our new products will have quality problems or other defects in the early stages of introduction that were not anticipated in the design of those products accordingly we cannot accurately determine the ultimate effect that our new products will have on our results of operations 

  

in addition the success of our new product introductions is dependent upon our ability to qualify as a primary source of supply with our oem customers in order for our products to be considered by our customers for qualification we must be among the leaders in timetomarket with those new products once a product is accepted for qualification testing any failure or delay in the qualification process or a requirement that we requalify can result in our losing sales to that customer until new products are introduced the limited number of highvolume oems magnifies the effect of missing a product qualification opportunity these risks are further magnified because we expect competitive pressures to result in declining sales and declining gross margins on our current generation products we cannot assure you that we will be among the leaders in timetomarket with new products or that we will be able to successfully qualify new products with our customers in the future 

  

smaller form factor disc drives—if we do not continue to successfully market smaller form factor disc drives our business may suffer 

  

the disc drive industry is experiencing significant increases in sales of smaller form factor disc drives for an expanding number of applications in particular notebook computers and consumer electronics devices but also including personal computers and enterprise storage applications many of these applications have typically used disc drives with a 35inch form factor which we currently manufacture some of these applications such as consumer electronics applications like digital music players and digital cameras represent fast growing markets for disc drives we initiated volume shipments of our first small form factor disc drive the momentus notebook disc drive to a number of oems in the second quarter of fiscal year 2004 in june 2004 we announced our first 1inch form factor disc drive additional capacity models of our momentus notebook disc drive and a 25inch form factor disc drive for enterprise storage applications since then we have introduced multiple highercapacity versions of our 1inch and 25inch disc drives for mobile computing consumer electronics and enterprise storage applications and we expect to begin offering a 18inch form factor disc drive during fiscal 2007 

  

we have experienced competition from other companies that produce alternative storage technologies like flash memory where increased capacity and lower cost of these technologies have resulted in competition with our lower capacity smaller form factor disc drives 

  

if we do not suitably adapt our product offerings to successfully introduce additional smaller form factor disc drives customers may decrease the amounts of our products that they purchase which would adversely affect our results of operations 

  

perpendicular recording technology—if our customers decide not to accept this new technology until either more disc drive manufacturers are providing it in their products or there is more performance history for this new technology our operating results will be adversely impacted if products based on this technology suffer unanticipated or atypical reliability or operability problems our operating results will be adversely impacted in addition products based on perpendicular technology require increased quantities of precious metals and scarce alloys like platinum and ruthenium which increases risk of higher costs and production delays that could adversely impact our operating results 

  

to address the growing demand for higher capacity products we have begun a transition to perpendicular recording technology to achieve continued growth in areal density to date we have announced perpendicular technology based products for the desktop enterprise notebook consumer electronics and branded solutions markets and we believe that we are ahead of our competitors in transitioning our product offerings to perpendicular recording technology we expect that by the end of fiscal 2007 more than half of our unit volume will consist of products using perpendicular recording technology perpendicular recording technology poses various technological challenges including a complex integration of the recording head the disc recording channel drive software and firmware as a system to the extent that our customers decide not to accept this new technology until either more disc drive manufacturers are providing it in their products or there is more performance history for this new technology our operating results will be adversely impacted 

  

in addition if these perpendicular recording technology based products suffer unanticipated or atypical failures that were not anticipated in the design or testing of those products our service and warranty costs may materially increase which would adversely impact our operating results 

  

perpendicular recording technology also requires recording media with more layers and the use of more precious metals and scarce alloys like platinum and ruthenium to create such layers these precious metals and scarce alloys have recently become increasingly expensive and at times difficult to acquire as our product offerings shift increasingly to perpendicular recording technology we will be exposed to increased risks that higher costs or reduced availability of these precious metals and scarce alloys could adversely impact our operating results 

  

seasonality—because we experience seasonality in the sales of our products our results of operations will generally be adversely impacted during our fourth fiscal quarter 

  

because sales of computer systems storage subsystems and consumer electronics tend to be seasonal we expect to continue to experience seasonality in our business as we respond to variations in our customers’ demand for disc drives in particular we anticipate that sales of our products will continue to be lower during our fourth fiscal quarter than the rest of the year in the desktop computer notebook computer and consumer electronics sectors of our business this seasonality is partially attributable to our customers’ increased sales of personal computers and consumer electronics during the winter holiday season in the enterprise sector of our business our sales are seasonal because of the capital budgeting and purchasing cycles of our end users because our working capital needs peak during periods in which we are increasing production in anticipation of orders that have not yet been received our operating results will fluctuate seasonally even if the forecasted demand for our products proves accurate 

  

furthermore it is difficult for us to evaluate the degree to which this seasonality may affect our business in future periods because our overall growth may have reduced the impact of this seasonality in recent periods for example because of dramatic rates of growth exhibited by the consumer electronics applications in the march and june 2005 quarters followed by a period of component constraints during the september and december 2005 quarters which impacted our production capacity we did not experience either a traditional seasonal decrease in sales of our products in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005 or a comparative seasonal increase in sales of our products in the first half of fiscal year 2006 the lack of seasonality in calendar year 2005 was atypical in the disc drive industry as evidenced by the modest seasonal decline we experienced in the march 2006 quarter particularly with respect to disc drives for desktop and mobile applications which continued in a more traditional pattern in the june 2006 quarter given the rate and unpredictability of product transitions and new product introductions in the consumer electronics market we may experience significant variability in unit demand in future periods which may be exacerbated by the highly seasonal nature of consumer electronics products generally 

  

difficulty in predicting quarterly demand—if we fail to predict demand accurately for our products in any quarter we may not be able to recapture the cost of our investments 

  

the disc drive industry operates on quarterly purchasing cycles with much of the order flow in any given quarter coming at the end of that quarter our manufacturing process requires us to make significant productspecific investments in inventory in each quarter for that quarter’s production because we typically receive the bulk of our orders late in a quarter after we have made our investments there is a risk that our orders will not be sufficient to allow us to recapture the costs of our investment before the products resulting from that investment have become obsolete our ability to accurately predict demand may be even more challenged in the near term as our customers reposition their demand following our acquisition of maxtor particularly in the markets served by maxtor we cannot assure you that we will be able to accurately predict demand in the future 

  

other factors that may negatively impact our ability to recapture the cost of investments in any given quarter include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

dependence on supply of equipment and components—if we experience shortages or delays in the receipt of critical equipment or components necessary to manufacture our products we may suffer lower operating margins production delays and other material adverse effects 

  

the cost quality and availability of components certain equipment and raw materials used to manufacture disc drives and key components like media and heads are critical to our success the equipment we use to manufacture our products and components is frequently custom made and comes from a few suppliers and the lead times required to obtain manufacturing equipment can be significant particularly important components for disc drives include readwrite heads recording media asics spindle motors printed circuit boards and suspension assemblies we rely on sole suppliers or a limited number of suppliers for some of these components including recording media that we do not manufacture asics spindle motors printed circuit boards and suspension assemblies in the past we have experienced increased costs and production delays when we were unable to obtain the necessary equipment or sufficient quantities of some components andor have been forced to pay higher prices or make volume purchase commitments or advance deposits for some components equipment or raw materials such as precious metals like platinum and ruthenium that were in short supply in the industry in general 

  

in addition the recent increases in demand for small form factor mobile products have led to shortages in the components used in smaller form factor disc drives such as the glass substrates used to make the recording media for such drives increasing unit growth for 35inch and smaller form factor nonmobile disc drives could also lead to constraints for the supply of aluminum media and substrates 

  

historically the technology sector specifically and the economy generally have experienced economic pressure which has resulted in consolidation among component manufacturers and may result in some component manufacturers exiting the industry or not making sufficient investments in research to develop new components 

  

if there is a shortage of or delay in supplying us with critical components equipment or raw materials then 

  

   

   

   

   

we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain critical components in a timely and economic manner or at all 

  

importance of reducing operating costs—if we do not reduce our operating expenses we will not be able to compete effectively in our industry 

  

our strategy involves to a substantial degree increasing revenue and product volume while at the same time reducing operating expenses in this regard we are continually engaged in ongoing companywide manufacturing efficiency activities intended to increase productivity and reduce costs our ongoing efforts to integrate maxtor’s business into our operations is a current focused instance of such activities in the past these activities have included closures and transfers of facilities significant personnel reductions and efforts to increase automation for example in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004 we undertook significant restructuring activities to reduce the costs of our operations and we continue to look at opportunities for further cost reductions which may result in additional restructuring activities in the future we cannot assure you that our efforts will result in the increased profitability cost savings or other benefits that we expect moreover the reduction of personnel and closure of facilities may adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in required volumes to meet customer demand and may result in other disruptions that affect our products and customer service in addition the transfer of manufacturing capacity of a product to a different facility frequently requires qualification of the new facility by some of our oem customers we cannot assure you that these activities and transfers will be implemented on a costeffective basis without delays or disruption in our production and without adversely affecting our customer relationships and results of operations 

  

industry demand—changes in demand for computer systems and storage subsystems has caused and may cause in the future a decline in demand for our products 

  

our disc drives are components in computers computer systems storage subsystems and consumer electronics devices the demand for these products has been volatile in a weak economy consumer spending tends to decline and retail demand for personal computers and consumer electronics devices tends to decrease as does enterprise demand for computer systems and storage subsystems unexpected slowdowns in demand for computer systems and storage subsystems generally cause sharp declines in demand for disc drive products 

  

additional causes of declines in demand for our products in the past have included announcements or introductions of major new operating systems or semiconductor improvements or changes in consumer preferences such as the shift from desktop to notebook computers we believe these announcements and introductions have from time to time caused consumers to defer their purchases and made inventory obsolete whenever an oversupply of disc drives causes participants in our industry to have higher than anticipated inventory levels we experience even more intense price competition from other disc drive manufacturers than usual 

  

dependence on distributors—we are dependent on sales to distributors which may increase price erosion and the volatility of our sales 

  

a substantial portion of our sales has been to distributors of desktop disc drive products product qualification programs in this distribution channel are limited which increases the number of competing products that are available to satisfy demand particularly in times of lengthening product cycles as a result purchasing decisions in this channel are based largely on price terms and product availability sales volumes through this channel are also less predictable and subject to greater volatility than sales to our oem customers in the second half of fiscal year 2004 a number of disc drive manufacturers independently launched initiatives to improve the stability of the distribution channel particularly with respect to the purchasing behavior of these distributors 

  

while other disc drive manufacturers have not launched such initiatives these actions have further increased the uncertainty as to demand within this market sector to the extent that distributors reduce their purchases of our products or prices decline significantly in the distribution channel our results of operations would be adversely affected 

  

longer product life cycles—lengthening of product life cycles can make planning product transitions difficult and may reduce the favorable impact of new product transitions 

  

in contrast to historical trends based on our recent experience in the industry with respect to new product introductions we believe that the current rate of growth in areal density is slowing from the rate of the last several years we believe that this slowdown in the rate of growth in areal density will continue until a significant advance in technology for the electronic storage of data such as perpendicular recording technology becomes commercially available 

  

when the rate of growth in areal density slows it may contribute to increased average price erosion to the extent historical price erosion patterns continue a limitation in our ability to introduce new products at higher prices and lengthened product life cycles which permits competitors more time to enter the market for a particular type of disc drive in addition the lengthening of product life cycles can make planning product transitions more difficult to the extent that we prematurely discontinue a product or do not timely introduce new products our operating results may be adversely affected 

  

because the rate of growth in areal density is slowing the favorable impact of new product introductions on our results of operations may be minimized historically the introduction of new products generally has had a favorable impact on our results of operations both because the new products are introduced at higher prices than existing competitive offerings and because advances in areal density technology have enabled lower manufacturing costs through a reduction in components such as readwrite heads and discs however in contrast to when the rate of growth in areal density is increasing a slowing rate of growth in areal density can limit the cost benefits of new products because it is technologically more difficult to reduce the number of readwrite heads and discs in a particular drive in addition given the environment of intense price competition in the absence of significant capacity or reliability increases it is difficult to obtain higher prices for new products 

  

importance of timetomarket—our operating results may depend on our being among the firsttomarket and achieving sufficient production volume with our new products 

  

to achieve consistent success with our oem customers it is important that we be an early provider of new types of disc drives featuring leading highquality technology and lower per gigabyte storage cost historically our operating results have substantially depended upon our ability to be among the firsttomarket with new product offerings however during a period of slowing areal density growth such as we are in now the importance of timetomarket may be less critical our market share and operating results in the future may be adversely affected particularly if the rate of growth in areal density resumes its historical pattern if we fail to 

  

   

   

   

   

if delivery of our products is delayed our oem customers may use our competitors’ products to meet their production requirements if the delay of our products causes delivery of those oems’ computer systems into which our products are integrated to be delayed consumers and businesses may purchase comparable products from the oems’ competitors 

  

moreover we face the related risk that consumers and businesses may wait to make their purchases if they want to buy a new product that has been shipped or announced but not yet released if this were to occur we may be unable to sell our existing inventory of products that may have become less efficient and cost effective compared to new products as a result even if we are among the firsttomarket with a given product subsequent introductions or announcements by our competitors of new products could cause us to lose revenue and not achieve a positive return on our investment in existing products and inventory 

  

dependence on key customers—we may be adversely affected by the loss of or reduced delayed or cancelled purchases by one or more of our larger customers 

  

some of our key customers including hewlettpackard dell emc microsoft and ibm account for a large portion of our disc drive revenue our recent acquisition of maxtor may increase our business with certain of our larger customers we have longstanding relationships with many of our customers however if any of our key customers were to significantly reduce their purchases from us our results of operations would be adversely affected while sales to major customers may vary from period to period a major customer that permanently discontinues or significantly reduces its relationship with us could be difficult to replace in line with industry practice new customers usually require that we pass a lengthy and rigorous qualification process at the customer’s cost accordingly it may be difficult or costly for us to attract new major customers additionally mergers acquisitions consolidations or other significant transactions involving our customers generally entail risks to our business if a significant transaction involving any of our key customers results in the loss of or reduction in purchases by these key customers it could have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and prospects 

  

dependence on growth in consumer electronics products—our recent results have been materially benefited by significant growth in new consumer electronics products which can experience significant volatility due to seasonal and other factors which could materially adversely impact our future results of operations 

  

our recent results have been materially benefited by significant growth in new consumer electronics applications like digital video recorders and digital music players which are experiencing unexpected growth after the typically high demand holiday season while this growth enabled us in fiscal year 2005 and to a lesser extent in fiscal year 2006 to offset the traditional seasonal decline usually experienced in the march and june quarters the demand for consumer electronics products can be even more volatile and unpredictable than the demand for compute products which have been our traditional markets this potential for unpredictable volatility is increased by the possibility of competing alternative storage technologies like flash memory meeting the customers’ cost and capacity metrics resulting in a rapid shift in demand from our products and disc drive technology generally to alternative storage technologies unpredictable fluctuations in demand for our products or rapid shifts in demand from our products to alternative storage technologies in new consumer electronics applications could materially adversely impact our future results of operations 

  

new product development and technological change—if we do not develop products in time to keep pace with technological changes our operating results will be adversely affected 

  

our customers have demanded new generations of disc drive products as advances in computer hardware and software have created the need for improved storage products with features such as increased storage capacity improved performance and reliability and lower cost we and our competitors have developed improved products and we will need to continue to do so in the future for fiscal years 2006 2005 and 2004 we had product development expenses of 805 million 645 million and 666 million respectively product development expenses for fiscal year 2006 included 28 million of noncash charges associated with the acquisition of maxtor we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully complete the design or introduction of new products in a timely manner that we will be able to manufacture new products in sufficient volumes with acceptable manufacturing yields that we will be able to successfully market these new products or 

  

that these products will perform to specifications on a longterm basis in addition the impact of slowing areal density growth may adversely impact our ability to be successful 

  

when we develop new products with higher capacity and more advanced technology our operating results may decline because the increased difficulty and complexity associated with producing these products increases the likelihood of reliability quality or operability problems if our products suffer increases in failures are of low quality or are not reliable customers may reduce their purchases of our products and our manufacturing rework and scrap costs and service and warranty costs may increase in addition a decline in the reliability of our products may make us less competitive as compared with other disc drive manufacturers 

  

economic risks associated with international operations—our international operations subject us to risks related to currency exchange fluctuations longer payment cycles for sales in foreign countries seasonality and disruptions in foreign markets tariffs and duties price controls potential adverse tax consequences increased costs our customers’ credit and access to capital and healthrelated risks 

  

we have significant operations in foreign countries including manufacturing facilities sales personnel and customer support operations we have manufacturing facilities in china malaysia northern ireland singapore and thailand in addition to those in the united states a substantial portion of our desktop disc drive assembly occurs in our facility in china 

  

our international operations are subject to economic risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries including the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

political risks associated with international operations—our international operations subject us to risks related to political unrest and terrorism 

  

we have manufacturing facilities in parts of the world that periodically experience political unrest this could disrupt our ability to manufacture important components as well as cause interruptions andor delays in our ability to ship components to other locations for continued manufacture and assembly any such delays or interruptions could result in delays in our ability to fill orders and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition us and international responses to the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 the ongoing hostilities in afghanistan iraq and lebanon and the risk of hostilities elsewhere in the world could exacerbate these risks 

  

legal and operational risks associated with international operations—our international operations subject us to risks related to staffing and management legal and regulatory requirements and the protection of intellectual property 

  

operating outside of the united states creates difficulties associated with staffing and managing our international manufacturing facilities complying with local legal and regulatory requirements and protecting our intellectual property we cannot assure you that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with applicable customs currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which we may be subject we also cannot assure you that these laws will not be modified 

  

risk of intellectual property litigation—our products may infringe the intellectual property rights of others which may cause us to incur unexpected costs or prevent us from selling our products 

  

we cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of others historically patent applications in the united states and some foreign countries have not been publicly disclosed until the patent is issued and we may not be aware of currently filed patent applications that relate to our products or technology if patents are later issued on these applications we may be liable for infringement we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims including claims of alleged infringement of the patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties by us or our licensees in connection with their use of our products 

  

we are currently subject to a lawsuit by convolve inc and the massachusetts institute of technology and a lawsuit pending in nanjing china involving intellectual property claims also maxtor is subject to a lawsuit by papst licensing gmbh involving patent infringement claims also on august 23 2006 siemens ag a german corporation filed a complaint against us in the us district court for the central district of california alleging that our current head technology infringes a siemens us patent 

  

in addition readrite corporation in a letter dated november 19 2002 and in correspondence after that date asserted that as of november 22 2000 we no longer had a license to readrite corporation patented head technology and that our disc drive products infringe at least two readrite corporation patents readrite filed for bankruptcy on june 17 2003 and western digital corporation purchased certain readrite assets from the bankruptcy on july 23 2003 including readrite’s alleged patent infringement claims against us on december 20 2005 the bankruptcy court ruled that we did not have a right to a license to readrite 

  

corporation patented head technology after november 22 2000 the bankruptcy court order was affirmed by the us district court for the northern district of california on may 8 2006 and we have decided not to appeal this decision because of the readrite bankruptcy western digital also does not have a right to a license to our patented head technology in addition neither western digital nor seagate otherwise has a license to the other’s intellectual property intellectual property litigation is expensive and timeconsuming regardless of the merits of any claim and could divert our management’s attention from operating our business in addition intellectual property lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties due to the complexity of the technical issues involved and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in defending ourselves against intellectual property claims moreover software patent litigation has increased due to the current uncertainty of the law and the increasing competition and overlap of product functionality in the field if we were to discover that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of others we would need to obtain licenses from these parties or substantially reengineer our products in order to avoid infringement we might not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms or at all or be able to reengineer our products successfully moreover if we are sued for patent infringement and lose the suit we could be required to pay substantial damages andor be enjoined from using or selling the infringing products or technology any of the foregoing could cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling our products which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

  

dependence on key personnel—the loss of some key executive officers and employees could negatively impact our business prospects 

  

our future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued service of key members of management as well as marketing sales and product development personnel the loss of one or more of our key personnel would have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition we believe our future success will also depend in large part upon our ability to attract retain and further motivate highly skilled management marketing sales and product development personnel we have experienced intense competition for personnel and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our key employees or that we will be successful in attracting assimilating and retaining personnel in the future 

  

system failures—system failures caused by events beyond our control could adversely affect computer equipment and electronic data on which our operations depend 

  

our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer equipment and the information stored in our databases from damage by among other things earthquake fire natural disaster power loss telecommunications failures unauthorized intrusion and other catastrophic events as our operations become more automated and increasingly interdependent our exposure to the risks posed by these types of events will increase a significant part of our operations is based in an area of california that has experienced power outages and earthquakes and is considered seismically active we do not have a contingency plan for addressing the kinds of events referred to in this paragraph that would be sufficient to prevent system failures and other interruptions in our operations that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

sox 404 compliance—while we believe that we currently have adequate internal control procedures in place we are still exposed to future risks of noncompliance and will continue to incur costs associated with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 

  

we have completed the evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting as required by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 from which we excluded the internal control over financial reporting of maxtor which we acquired on may 19 2006 although our assessment testing and evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of june 30 2006 our internal controls over financial reporting were effective we cannot predict the outcome of our testing in future periods if our internal controls are ineffective in future periods our financial results or the market price of our shares could be adversely affected we will incur additional expenses and commitment of management’s time in connection with further evaluations 

  

future sales—additional sales of our common shares by certain equity investors affiliated with certain of our directors or our executive officers or issuances by us in connection with future acquisitions or otherwise could cause the price of our common shares to decline 

  

if certain equity investors affiliated with certain of our directors or our executive officers sell a substantial number of our common shares in the future the market price of our common shares could decline the perception among investors that these sales may occur could produce the same effect any of silver lake partners texas pacific group or august capital can unilaterally require that we file registration statements covering common shares held by them and they and other equity investors including some of our executive officers have rights to include their common shares in certain registration statements that we may file by exercising their registration rights and selling a large number of common shares any of these equity investors could cause the price of our common shares to decline furthermore if they were to include common shares in a registration statement initiated by us those additional shares could impair our ability to raise needed capital by depressing the price at which we could sell our common shares 

  

new sac has disposed of all of its shares in us through quarterly and monthly staged distributions to its more than 200 shareholders in particular new sac made quarterly distributions of 25 million of our common shares owned by it to the new sac shareholders beginning in the spring of 2005 and continuing for the next three quarters thereafter for a total distribution in this manner of approximately 100 million common shares through january 2006 absent registration these distributed shares will be illiquid and not eligible for resale in the public markets under rule 144 until 12 months from the date of their distribution out of new sac the first of these quarterly distributed shares became eligible for resale under rule 144 on may 16 2006 and the second of these distributions became eligible for resale on july 26 2006 

  

in addition to the distributions described in the previous paragraph new sac distributed approximately 50 million of our common shares by making monthly distributions of approximately 10 million of our common shares to new sac shareholders from september 2005 through january 2006 offers to the public by the selling shareholders named in our registration statement on form s3 of the approximately 50 million common shares distributed by new sac on a monthly basis may be made pursuant to the registration statement on form s3 any sales by former new sac shareholders their transferees or distributees and in particular certain equity investors affiliated with certain of our directors or our executive officers could cause the market price of our common shares to decline 

  

one component of our business strategy is to make acquisitions in the event of any future acquisitions we could issue additional common shares for example in may 2006 we issued approximately 97 million of our common shares and assumed options and nonvested stock in connection with our acquisition of maxtor corporation issuing shares in connection with acquisitions would have the effect of diluting your ownership percentage of the common shares and could cause the price of our common shares to decline 

  

volatile public markets—the price of our common shares may be volatile and could decline significantly 

  

the stock market in general and the market for technology stocks in particular has recently experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of companies if these market or industrybased fluctuations continue the trading price of our common shares could decline significantly independent of our actual operating performance and you could lose all or a substantial part of your investment the market price of our common shares could fluctuate significantly in response to several factors including among others 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

failure to pay quarterly dividends—our failure to pay quarterly dividends to our common shareholders could cause the market price of our common shares to decline significantly 

  

we paid quarterly dividends of 008 per share on each of august 19 2005 november 18 2005 february 17 2006 may 19 2006 and september 1 2006 to our common shareholders of record as of august 5 2005 november 4 2005 february 3 2006 may 5 2006 and august 18 2006 respectively 

  

our ability to pay quarterly dividends will be subject to among other things general business conditions within the disc drive industry our financial results the impact of paying dividends on our credit ratings and legal and contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends by our subsidiaries to us or by us to our common shareholders including restrictions imposed by the covenants contained in the indenture governing our senior notes and the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility any reduction or discontinuation of quarterly dividends could cause the market price of our common shares to decline significantly our payment of dividends may also result in a conversion rate adjustment under maxtor’s 2375 convertible senior notes due 2012 moreover in the event our payment of quarterly dividends is reduced or discontinued our failure or inability to resume paying dividends at historical levels could result in a persistently low market valuation of our common shares 

  

potential governmental action—governmental action against companies located in offshore jurisdictions may lead to a reduction in the demand for our common shares 

  

recent federal and state legislation has been proposed and additional legislation may be proposed in the future which if enacted could have an adverse tax impact on either seagate or its shareholders for example the eligibility for favorable tax treatment of taxable distributions paid to us shareholders of seagate as qualified dividends could be eliminated 

  

securities litigation—significant fluctuations in the market price of our common shares could result in securities class action claims against us 

  

significant price and value fluctuations have occurred with respect to the publicly traded securities of disc drive companies and technology companies generally the price of our common shares is likely to be volatile in the future in the past following periods of decline in the market price of a company’s securities class action lawsuits have often been pursued against that company if similar litigation were pursued against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity

market information 

  

our common shares have traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol “stx” since december 11 2002 prior to that time there was no public market for our common shares the high and low sales prices of our common shares as reported by the new york stock exchange are set forth below for the periods indicated 

  

   

the closing price of our common shares as reported by the new york stock exchange on september 1 2006 was 2259 per share as of september 1 2006 there were approximately 2526 holders of record of our common shares we did not sell any of our equity securities during fiscal year 2006 that were not registered under the securities exchange act of 1933 as amended 

  

dividends 

  

we are currently paying our shareholders a quarterly dividend of no more than 008 per share up to 032 per share annually so long as the aggregate amount of the dividend does not exceed 50 of our cumulative consolidated net income plus 100 of net cash proceeds received from the issuance of capital all of which are measured from the period beginning june 30 2001 and ending the most recent fiscal quarter in which financial statements are internally available 

  

we are restricted in our ability to pay dividends by the covenants contained in the indenture governing our senior notes and revolving credit facility our declaration of dividends is also subject to cayman islands law and the discretion of our board of directors under the terms of the seagate technology shareholders agreement which was amended on september 2 2004 at least seven members of our board of directors must approve the payment of dividends in excess of 15 of our net income in the prior fiscal year provided that such consent is not required to declare and pay our regular quarterly dividend of up to 008 per share in deciding whether or not to declare quarterly dividends our directors will take into account such factors as general business conditions within the disc drive industry our financial results our capital requirements contractual and legal restrictions on the payment of dividends by our subsidiaries to us or by us to our shareholders the impact of paying dividends on our credit ratings and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant 

  

since the closing of our initial public offering in december 2002 we have paid dividends pursuant to our quarterly dividend policy totaling approximately 392 million in the aggregate 

  

   

to the extent that the amount of any distribution exceeds our current or accumulated earnings and profits for us federal income tax purposes in any taxable year the distribution will be treated as a return of capital for us tax purposes causing a reduction in a shareholder’s adjusted tax basis in the common shares because we did not have any current or accumulated earnings and profits for us federal income tax purposes for our taxable year ended june 30 2006 distributions on our common shares during this period were treated as a return of capital rather than dividend income for us federal income tax purposes we anticipate that we will have accumulated earnings and profits for us federal income tax purposes in fiscal year 2007 therefore distributions to shareholders in fiscal year 2007 are anticipated to be treated as dividend income 

  

furthermore we believe that we were a foreign personal holding company for us federal income tax purposes for our taxable years ended july 1 2005 and july 2 2004 pursuant to the american jobs creation act of 2004 foreign corporations will be excluded from the application of the personal holding company rules of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” effective for taxable years of foreign corporations beginning after december 31 2004 for the company the effective date is its fiscal year beginning july 2 2005 as a result if taxable distributions on our common shares are made after july 1 2005 us shareholders who are individuals may be eligible for reduced rates of taxation applicable to certain dividend income currently a maximum rate of 15 on distributions made after the effective date 

  

repurchases of our equity securities 

  

in october 2005 our board authorized the use of up to 400 million for the repurchase of our outstanding common shares during the quarter ended june 30 2006 the company repurchased a total of approximately 167 million common shares for approximately 400 million all of which were cancelled and are no longer outstanding we did not repurchase any shares during the first three quarters of fiscal year 2006 or during fiscal years 2005 and 2004 

  

share repurchases during the quarter ended june 30 2006 were as follows

our company 

  

we are the leader in the design manufacturing and marketing of rigid disc drives rigid disc drives which are commonly referred to as disc drives or hard drives are used as the primary medium for storing electronic information in systems ranging from desktop and notebook computers and consumer electronics devices to data centers delivering information over corporate networks and the internet we produce a broad range of disc drive products that make us a leader in the industry with products addressing enterprise applications where our products are used in enterprise servers mainframes and workstations desktop applications where our products are used in desktop computers mobile computing applications where our products are used in notebook computers and consumer electronics applications where our products are used in a wide variety of devices such as digital video recorders dvr digital music players and gaming consoles 

  

we sell our disc drives primarily to major original equipment manufacturers or oems and also market to distributors under our globally recognized brand name for fiscal years 2006 2005 and 2004 approximately 72 72 and 64 respectively of our disc drive revenue was from sales to oems including customers such as hewlettpackard dell emc microsoft and ibm we have longstanding relationships with many of these oem customers we also have key relationships with major distributors who sell our disc drive products to small oems dealers system integrators and retailers throughout most of the world also we are currently expanding our direct sales to retailers for fiscal years 2006 2005 and 2004 approximately 30 31 and 29 respectively of our disc drive revenue came from customers located in north america approximately 27 28 and 33 respectively came from customers located in europe and approximately 43 41 and 38 respectively came from customers located in the far east substantially all of our revenue is denominated in us dollars 

  

on may 19 2006 we acquired maxtor corporation in a stock for stock transaction we expect the acquisition of maxtor to build on our foundation as the leading global disc drive company leveraging the strength of our significant operating scale to drive product innovation and maximize operational efficiencies we believe the combined company will be wellpositioned to accelerate delivery of a diverse set of compelling and costeffective solutions to the growing customer base for data storage products 

  

the acquisition provides us with enhanced scale greater capacity and an increased customer base which we expect will allow us to eventually achieve significant cost synergies from leveraging our research and development platform reducing product and supply chain costs as well as scaling our sales marketing and administrative infrastructure we also acquired a final assembly and test manufacturing facility in suzhou china significantly increasing our chinabased manufacturing presence as well as the retail and branded solutions operations of maxtor and the right to use the maxtor brand and other related trade names the acquisition has also provided us access to talented personnel in the branded solution product development and other key functional areas 

  

we are engaged in integration and restructuring processes whereby we are working with maxtor’s customers to quickly replace maxtordesigned disc drive products with seagatedesigned disc drive products we expect this process to be substantially complete by the end of calendar year 2006 we foresee there to be a 

  

transitional period through the first six months of fiscal year 2007 during which we expect the inefficient use of the maxtor manufacturing infrastructure as we wind down the volume of maxtordesigned disc drive products and the upfront investment needed for capacity additions to support the rampup of seagatedesigned disc drive products in addition work force reductions took place after the transaction closed as we addressed the redundancies that exists between the two companies and will continue to be implemented based on production transition customer support and administrative requirements 

  

overview 

  

industry overview our industry is characterized by several trends that have a material impact on our strategic planning financial condition and results of operations 

  

first we believe that the industry is continuing to experience several growth trends relative to overall demand including 

  

   

   

we believe that for some of the fastest growing applications described above the demand is focused on higher capacity disc drive products 

  

second our industry has been characterized by continuous and steady price erosion such price erosion is more pronounced during periods of 

  

   

   

   

in particular in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 the industry experienced more pronounced price erosion where market share gains became the primary focus of a number of our competitors we expect a continuing competitive price environment very similar to the june 2006 quarter throughout fiscal year 2007 as competitors continue to focus on market share gains following our acquisition of maxtor 

  

third while the industry has been recently constrained by the availability of media supply we believe there is now adequate media capacity planned or in place to meet industry demand we believe there will be continued tightness in glass substrate supplies through the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2007 which could result in spot shortages during the september 2006 quarter in addition we believe aluminum substrates remain at very high capacity utilization and supply appears to be very tight through the end of calendar year 2006 the lead times and capital requirements necessary to build component capacity can be substantial this strain on industry and key component capacity may be reducing the potential for excess industry supply and accelerated price erosion and may be increasing the potential for market share shifts among industry competitors due to product availability this dynamic may also slow the rate of industry cost reductions 

  

fourth our industry has been characterized by significant advances in technology which have contributed to rapid product life cycles the importance of being first to market with new products and the difficulty in recovering research and development expenses also there is a continued need to successfully execute product transitions and new product introductions as factors such as quality reliability and manufacturing yields become of increasing competitive importance 

  

to address the growing demand for higher capacity products the industry has begun a transition to perpendicular recording technology which is necessary to achieve continued growth in areal density perpendicular recording technology poses various technological challenges including a complex integration of the recording head the disc recording channel drive software and firmware as a system at this time it is unclear what impact this transition to perpendicular recording technology will have on the industry 

  

finally to the extent that our industry builds product based on expectations of demand that do not materialize the distribution channel may experience an oversupply of products that could lead to increased price erosion the industry excluding seagate exited the june 2006 quarter with what we believe to be approximately six weeks of distribution inventory in the desktop channel 

  

seagate overview  we are a leader in the disc drive industry with products that address substantially all of the available consumer electronics mobile computing enterprise and desktop storage markets we maintain a highly integrated approach to our business by designing and manufacturing a significant portion of the components we view as critical to our products such as readwrite heads and recording media we believe that our control of these key technologies combined with our platform design and manufacturing enable us to achieve product performance timetomarket leadership and manufacturing flexibility which allows us to respond to customers and market opportunities our technology ownership combined with our integrated design and manufacturing approach have allowed us to effectively leverage our leadership in traditional computing markets into new highergrowth markets with only incremental product development and manufacturing costs 

  

revenue in fiscal year 2006 of approximately 92 billion was driven primarily by customer acceptance of our new products introduced in june 2005 and throughout the fiscal year particularly in the mobile compute and certain portions of the consumer electronics markets in addition maxtordesigned products contributed 279 million to revenue for the six weeks from the closing of the acquisition on may 19 2006 through the end of the fiscal year 

  

   

   

   

   

for both fiscal years 2006 and 2005 72 of our disc drive revenue was from sales to oems for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 the third quarter of fiscal year 2006 and the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005 69 73 and 76 respectively of our disc drive revenue was from sales to oems although the sales of maxtordesigned products was only included in the consolidated revenue for the six weeks subsequent to the closing date of the acquisition only approximately 42 of these maxtordesigned disc drive products were sold to oems thereby causing a reduction in consolidated disc drive revenue from sales to oems as a percentage of total disc drive revenue from the march 2006 to the june 2006 quarter 

  

on may 19 2006 we acquired maxtor corporation in a stock for stock transaction our fiscal year 2006 results include maxtor’s operating losses from may 19 2006 through june 30 2006 as well as purchase accounting and integration related charges we are engaged in restructuring and integration activities which are expected to result in approximately 500 million of cash charges in addition to the anticipated cash expenditures we expect significant noncash charges including those associated with the amortization of intangible assets and stockbased compensation which we currently estimate at approximately 385 million approximately 200 million of which is expected to be incurred in the first year following the closing as part of these activities the company is winding down the manufacture of maxtordesigned disc drive products and rampingup the volume of seagatedesigned disc drive products we expect this to require upfront investment in capacity additions and during the transitional period through the first six months of fiscal year 2007 an inefficient use of our manufacturing infrastructure which will adversely affect gross margins we expect this process to be substantially complete by the end of calendar year 2006 

  

we expect the second half of fiscal year 2007 will reflect the positive impact of our improved cost structure product refreshes that include cost optimized products designed specifically for lowcost applications new market access with our recently announced 18inch drive and the completion of the maxtor integration  

  

historically we have exhibited seasonally higher unit demand during the first half of each fiscal year however because of the dramatic rates of growth exhibited by the consumer electronics applications in the 

  

march and june 2005 quarters followed by a period of component constraints during the september and december 2005 quarters which impacted our production capacity we did not experience either a traditional seasonal decrease in sales of our products in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005 or a comparative seasonal increase in sales of our products in the first half of fiscal year 2006 the lack of seasonality in calendar year 2005 was atypical in the disc drive industry as evidenced by the modest seasonal decline we experienced in the march 2006 quarter we saw a return to traditional seasonality in the june 2006 quarter particularly with respect to disc drives for desktop and mobile applications 

  

we believe seagate is leading the transition to perpendicular recording technology to date we have announced perpendicular technology based products for all four major markets with products shipping for revenue in the desktop enterprise and mobile markets during fiscal year 2006 and in all four major markets in fiscal year 2007 

  

we made capital investments during fiscal year 2006 that totaled 10 billion for fiscal 2007 we expect up to 13 billion in capital investment will be required the capital spending is to support continued growth and to complete the integration of maxtor into our operations 

  

acquisition of maxtor corporation 

  

on december 20 2005 we entered into an agreement and plan of merger the “merger agreement” with maxtor corporation a delaware corporation and md merger corporation a delaware corporation and direct whollyowned subsidiary of seagate by which seagate agreed to acquire maxtor the “merger” and whereby maxtor would become a wholly owned subsidiary of seagate on may 19 2006 we completed the acquisition of maxtor in a stock for stock transaction the acquisition was structured to qualify as a taxfree reorganization and we have accounted for the acquisition in accordance with sfas no 141 business combinations “sfas 141” the combination of the two companies’ brands and the related product lines represent the most differentiated storage offering to customers and enhance seagate’s scale and capacity to better drive technology advances and accelerate delivery of a wide range of differentiated products and costeffective solutions to a growing base of customers 

  

under the terms of the merger agreement each share of maxtor common stock was exchanged for 037 of our common shares we issued approximately 969 million of our common shares to maxtor’s stockholders based on the average closing price of our common shares on the nyse for the two days prior to including and two days subsequent to the public announcement of the merger december 21 2005 of 2002 and including capitalized acquisitionrelated costs and the fair value of options assumed and nonvested shares exchanged the transaction was valued for accounting purposes at approximately 20 billion we also assumed all outstanding options to purchase maxtor common stock with a weightedaverage exercise price of 1610 per share each option assumed was converted into an option to purchase one of our common shares after applying the 037 exchange ratio in total we assumed and converted maxtor options into options to purchase approximately 71 million of our common shares in addition we assumed and converted all outstanding maxtor nonvested stock into approximately 13 million of our nonvested shares based on the exchange ratio the fair value of options assumed and nonvested shares exchanged had a fair value of approximately 86 million see note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report 

  

we have identified and recorded the assets including specifically identifiable intangible assets and liabilities assumed from maxtor at their estimated fair values as at may 19 2006 the date of acquisition and allocated the residual value of approximately 25 billion to goodwill the values assigned to certain acquired assets and liabilities are preliminary are based on information available as of june 30 2006 and may be adjusted as further information becomes available during the allocation period of up to 12 months from the acquisition date maxtor is now a whollyowned subsidiary of ours and the results of maxtor’s operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements after the may 19 2006 acquisition date 

  

sales and distribution of shares by new sac 

  

new sac an exempted company incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the cayman islands originally acquired us in november 2000 from seagate technology inc from november 2000 to december 2002 we were a wholly owned subsidiary of new sac from time to time since december 2002 new sac has sold and distributed our common shares to its shareholders which included certain current and former directors officers and employees of the company as of january 3 2006 new sac had distributed substantially all of our common shares that it held to its shareholders pursuant to the distributions described below and new sac no longer owns any of our common shares 

  

from may 2005 through january 2006 new sac distributed approximately 100 million of our common shares to its more than 200 shareholders in four quarterly distributions these distributed shares are illiquid and not eligible for resale in the public markets under rule 144 until 12 months from the date of their distribution out of new sac unless they are subsequently registered for resale the first of these quarterly distributed shares became eligible for resale under rule 144 on may 16 2006 and the second quarterly distribution became eligible for resale under rule 144 on july 26 2006 the two remaining quarterly distributions of 25 million shares each will become eligible for resale on october 21 2006 and january 3 2007 

  

in addition from september 2005 through january 2006 new sac distributed approximately 50 million of our common shares through five monthly distributions to its shareholders these shares have been registered for resale pursuant to a registration statement on form s3 that was declared effective by the securities and exchange commission in december 2005 

  

results of operations 

  

we list in the tables below the historical consolidated statements of operations in dollars and as a percentage of revenue for the fiscal years indicated 

  

   

   

fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005 

  

the fiscal year 2006 results include the results of maxtor for the six weeks from the closing date of the acquisition of may 19 2006 through june 30 2006 in connection with the maxtor acquisition we incurred a number of accounting charges and other costs which impacted our earnings for the last quarter of and the entire fiscal year 2006 

  

revenue revenue for fiscal year 2006 was approximately 92 billion up 22 from approximately 76 billion in fiscal year 2005 the increase in revenue was primarily due to record disc drive shipments of 1187 million units in fiscal year 2006 compared to 981 million units in fiscal year 2005 as well as an improved product mix of our new products offset by price erosion our overall average sales price per unit asp for our products was 78 for fiscal year 2006 up from 77 in fiscal year 2005 

  

unit shipments for our products in fiscal year 2006 were as follows 

  

   

   

   

   

we maintain various sales programs aimed at increasing customer demand we exercise judgment in formulating the underlying estimates related to distributor inventory levels sales program participation and customer claims submittals in determining the provision for such programs during fiscal year 2006 sales programs recorded as contra revenue were approximately 7 of our gross revenue compared to 5 of our gross revenue for fiscal year 2005 the increase in sales programs as a percentage of gross revenue was primarily the result of higher price erosion in the distribution channel and growth in retail sales which typically require higher pointofsale rebates 

  

cost of revenue cost of revenue for fiscal year 2006 was approximately 71 billion up 20 from approximately 59 billion in fiscal year 2005 gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2006 was 23 as compared with 22 for fiscal year 2005 the increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue from fiscal year 2005 was primarily due to higher overall unit shipments and an increase mix of new highermargin products partially offset by higher costs associated with new product transitions increased warranty cost and customer service inventory writedowns stockbased compensation costs price erosion and in connection with 

  

the maxtor acquisition an increasingly underutilized manufacturing infrastructure required to build maxtordesigned disc drive products and purchase accounting charges primarily stockbased compensation and amortization of existing technology and integration including retention costs 

  

product development expense product development expense increased by 160 million or 25 for fiscal year 2006 when compared with fiscal year 2005 the increase in product development expense from fiscal year 2005 was primarily due to increases of 65 million in salaries and benefits resulting from increased staffing levels and variable performancebased compensation 38 million in product development support costs 24 million in stockbased compensation and 28 million in costs related to the maxtor acquisition including integration and retention costs and stockbased compensation 

  

marketing and administrative expense marketing and administrative expense increased by 141 million or 46 for fiscal year 2006 when compared with fiscal year 2005 the increase in marketing and administrative expense from fiscal year 2005 was primarily due to increases of 54 million in salaries and benefits resulting from increased staffing levels and variable performancebased compensation 24 million in stockbased compensation 13 million in advertising and promotion and 18 million in costs related to the maxtor acquisition including integration and retention costs and stockbased compensation 

  

amortization of intangibles  amortization of intangibles increased by 7 million due to intangibles acquired in the maxtor acquisition 

  

restructuring during fiscal year 2006 we recorded restructuring costs of approximately 4 million in connection with our ongoing restructuring activities these costs were related to a restructuring plan established to continue the alignment of our global workforce with existing and anticipated future business requirements in our far east operations the restructuring costs were comprised of employee termination costs relating to a continuing effort to optimize our production around the world we have completed these restructuring activities 

  

in connection with the maxtor acquisition we accrued certain exit costs aggregating 251 million all of which increased goodwill and did not impact our operating results see note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report 

  

net other income expense net other income increased by 40 million for fiscal year 2006 when compared with fiscal year 2005 the change from fiscal year 2005 was primarily due to an increase in interest income of 33 million resulting from higher average interest rates and higher average balances in our interest bearing accounts and a decrease in interest expense of 7 million resulting from the repayment of a term loan in fiscal year 2006 

  

income taxes we recorded a provision for income taxes of 84 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2006 compared to a provision for income taxes of 25 million for the fiscal year ended july 1 2005 we are a foreign holding company incorporated in the cayman islands with foreign and us subsidiaries that operate in multiple taxing jurisdictions as a result our worldwide operating income is either subject to varying rates of tax or is exempt from tax due to tax holidays or tax incentive programs we operate under in china malaysia singapore switzerland and thailand these tax holidays or incentives are scheduled to expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2015 our provision for income taxes recorded for the fiscal year ended june 30 2006 differs from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying a notional us 35 rate to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i the tax benefit related to the aforementioned tax holidays and tax incentive programs ii an increase in our valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets and iii utilization of research tax credits generated in the current year our provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended july 1 2005 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying a notional us 35 rate to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i the tax benefit related to the aforementioned tax holidays and tax incentive programs ii an increase in our valuation allowance for certain foreign deferred income tax assets iii a tax benefit related to a reduction in previously accrued foreign 

  

income taxes and iv utilization of research tax credits generated in that year based on our foreign ownership structure and subject to i potential future increases in our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets ii limitations imposed by internal revenue code section 382 on usage of certain tax attributes further described below and iii use of tax attributes acquired from maxtor and other acquisitions for which a valuation allowance has initially been recognized that if reversed will be reversed to goodwill we anticipate that our effective tax rate in future periods will generally be less than the us federal statutory rate dividend distributions received from our us subsidiaries may be subject to us withholding taxes when and if distributed deferred tax liabilities have not been recorded on unremitted earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries as these earnings will not be subject to tax in the cayman islands or us federal income tax if remitted to our foreign parent holding company 

  

as of june 30 2006 we have recorded net deferred tax assets of 78 million the realization of which is primarily dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income in fiscal years 2007 and 2008 although realization is not assured we believe that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable however may increase or decrease in subsequent quarters when we reevaluate our estimates of future taxable income 

  

as a result of the maxtor acquisition maxtor underwent a change in ownership within the meaning of section 382 of the internal revenue code irc section 382 on may 19 2006 in general irc section 382 places annual limitations on the use of certain tax attributes such as net operating losses and tax credit carryovers in existence at the ownership change date as of june 30 2006 approximately 14 billion and 378 million of us federal and state net operating losses respectively and 39 million of tax credit carryovers acquired from maxtor are generally subject to an annual limitation of approximately 110 million certain amounts may be accelerated into the first five years following the acquisition pursuant to irc section 382 and published notices on january 3 2005 we underwent a change in ownership under irc section 382 due to the sale of common shares to the public by our then largest shareholder new sac based on an independent valuation as of january 3 2005 the annual limitation for this change is 448 million as of june 30 2006 there are 447 million of us net operating loss carryforwards and 111 million of us tax credit carryforwards subject to the irc section 382 limitation associated with the january 3 2005 change to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets associated with tax attributes subject to this irc section 382 limitation will not be realized a valuation allowance has been provided 

  

the internal revenue service is currently examining our federal income tax returns for fiscal years ending in 2001 through 2004 the timing of the settlement of these examinations is uncertain we believe that adequate amounts of tax have been provided for any final assessments that may result 

  

fiscal year 2005 compared to fiscal year 2004 

  

revenue revenue for fiscal year 2005 was approximately 76 billion up 21 from approximately 62 billion in fiscal year 2004 the increase in revenue was primarily due to record disc drive shipments of 981 million units in fiscal year 2005 compared to 793 million units in fiscal year 2004 as well as an improved product mix of our new products offset by price erosion unit shipments for our products in fiscal year 2005 were as follows 

  

   

   

   

   

our overall average sales price per unit asp for our products was 80 for fiscal year 2005 up from 71 in fiscal year 2004 this increase in overall asp reflects the favorable impact of the new products many of which have asp’s above the company average 

  

we maintained various sales programs aimed at increasing customer demand we exercise judgment in formulating the underlying estimates related to distributor inventory levels sales program participation and customer claims submittals in determining the provision for such programs during fiscal year 2005 sales programs recorded as contra revenue were approximately 5 of our gross revenue compared to 7 of our gross revenue for fiscal year 2004 the decrease in sales programs as a percentage of gross revenue was the result of a shift in revenue mix from our distribution customers where the various sales programs are more prevalent to our oem customers and lower channel inventory levels with respect to our distribution customers 

  

cost of revenue cost of revenue for fiscal year 2005 was approximately 59 billion up 23 from approximately 48 billion in fiscal year 2004 gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2005 was 22 as compared with 23 for fiscal year 2004 the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue from fiscal year 2004 was primarily due to price erosion higher costs associated with new product transitions and increased warranty accruals with respect to new and older products partially offset by higher overall unit shipments and an increased mix of new highermargin products 

  

product development expense product development expense decreased by 21 million or 3 for fiscal year 2005 when compared with fiscal year 2004 the decrease in product development expense from fiscal year 2004 was primarily due to decreases of 26 million in salaries resulting from reductions in staffing levels 10 million in product development support costs 6 million resulting from the discontinuation of certain benefits associated with our postretirement medical plan 4 million in relocation costs and 4 million in depreciation these decreases were partially offset by an increase of 30 million in variable performancebased compensation 

  

marketing and administrative expense marketing and administrative expense increased by 16 million or 6 for fiscal year 2005 when compared with fiscal year 2004 the increase in marketing and administrative expense from fiscal year 2004 was primarily due to increases of 27 million in variable performancebased compensation and 4 million in the provision for bad debt these increases were partially offset by decreases of 13 million in salaries resulting from reductions in staffing levels and 3 million resulting from the discontinuation of certain benefits associated with our postretirement medical plan 

  

restructuring during fiscal year 2005 we recorded 8 million in restructuring charges these costs were primarily a result of a restructuring plan established to continue the alignment of our global workforce with existing and anticipated future business requirements primarily in our us operations the restructuring charges were comprised of employee termination costs of 5 million relating to a reduction in our workforce and approximately 3 million in charges related to impaired facilities improvements as a result of the alignment plan these restructuring activities were substantially complete at july 1 2005 additionally we reversed approximately 8 million of our restructuring accruals comprised of approximately 3 million recorded in prior fiscal years relating to accrued severance benefits that were less than amounts originally estimated and approximately 5 million relating to the sale in the first quarter of fiscal year 2005 of a surplus building previously impaired in the fiscal year 2000 restructuring 

  

net other income expense net other income of 10 million in fiscal year 2005 changed from net other expense of 16 million for fiscal year 2004 the change from fiscal year 2004 was primarily due to an increase in interest income of 18 million resulting from higher average interest rates and higher average balances in our interest bearing accounts and 10 million in income in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005 resulting from the settlement of a litigation matter 

  

income taxes we recorded a provision for income taxes of 25 million for the fiscal year ended july 1 2005 compared to a benefit from income taxes of 101 million for the fiscal year ended july 2 2004 we are a foreign holding company incorporated in the cayman islands with foreign and us subsidiaries that operate in multiple taxing jurisdictions as a result our worldwide operating income is either subject to varying rates of tax or is exempt from tax due to tax holidays or tax incentive programs we operate under in china malaysia singapore and thailand these tax holidays or incentives are scheduled to expire in whole or in part at various 

  

dates through 2015 our provision for income taxes recorded for the fiscal year ended july 1 2005 differs from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying a notional us 35 rate to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i the tax benefit related to the aforementioned tax holidays and tax incentive programs ii an increase in our valuation allowance for certain foreign deferred tax assets iii a tax benefit related to a reduction in previously accrued foreign income taxes and iv utilization of us research tax credits generated in the current year our provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended july 2 2004 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying a notional us 35 rate to income before income taxes primarily due to i the tax benefit related to the aforementioned tax holidays and tax incentive programs ii an additional valuation allowance recorded for us deferred tax assets and iii the reversal of the 125 million tax indemnification amount for veritas further described below dividend distributions received from our us subsidiaries may be subject to us withholding taxes when and if distributed deferred tax liabilities have not been recorded on certain unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as these earnings will not be subject to tax in the cayman islands or to us federal income taxes if remitted to our foreign parent holding company 

  

on january 3 2005 we underwent a change in ownership within the meaning of section 382 of the internal revenue code irc sec 382 due to the sale of common shares to the public by our then largest shareholder new sac based upon an independent valuation as of january 3 2005 the annual limitation is 448 million as of july 1 2005 409 million of us net operating loss carryforwards and 123 million of us tax credit carryforwards were subject to the sec 382 limitation associated with the january 3 2005 change a valuation allowance has been provided for deferred tax assets associated with tax attributes subject to the irc section 382 limitations that we concluded will not be realized the impact of the irc sec 382 limitation was to increase our current tax expense related to the tax benefit of stock options credited to shareholders equity by approximately 15 million during fiscal year 2005 

  

in the fiscal year ended july 2 2004 we recorded a 125 million income tax benefit from the reversal of 125 million of accrued income taxes relating to tax indemnification amounts due to veritas pursuant to the indemnification agreement between seagate delaware suez acquisition corporation and veritas the tax indemnification amount was recorded by us in connection with the purchase of the operating assets of seagate delaware and represented us tax liabilities previously accrued by seagate delaware for periods prior to the acquisition date of the operating assets as a result of the conclusion of the tax audits with no additional tax liabilities due management determined that the 125 million accrual for the tax indemnification was no longer required and it was reversed in our third quarter of fiscal year 2004 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

the following is a discussion of our principal liquidity requirements and capital resources 

  

we had approximately 17 billion in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments at june 30 2006 which includes 910 million of cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents increased by 164 million during fiscal year 2006 up from 746 million at july 1 2005 this increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily provided by cash from operations of approximately 15 billion the net decrease in shortterm investments and cash received upon the acquisition of maxtor offset by capital additions repayment of longterm debt dividends paid to shareholders and repurchases of common shares 

  

until required for other purposes our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase our shortterm investments consist primarily of readily marketable debt securities with remaining maturities of more than 90 days at the time of purchase 

  

cash provided by operating activities 

  

cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2006 was approximately 15 billion and consisted primarily of net income adjusted for depreciation amortization and stockbased compensation partially offset by an increase in our net operating liabilities 

  

cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2005 was approximately 14 billion and consisted primarily of net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization combined with an increase in our net operating assets 

  

cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2004 of 635 million was primarily attributable to net income as adjusted for noncash expenses for depreciation and amortization and the noncash benefit for the reversal of tax indemnification amounts 

  

cash used in investing activities 

  

during fiscal year 2006 we used 561 million for net cash investing activities which was primarily attributable to expenditures for property equipment and leasehold improvements of approximately 10 billion partially offset by the maturities and sales of shortterm investments in excess of purchases of 308 million as well as 297 million of net cash acquired from maxtor the approximately 10 billion we invested in property equipment and leasehold improvements was comprised of 

  

   

   

   

   

the 317 million increase in investment in property equipment and leasehold improvements from fiscal year 2005 was for increased capacity to support 2006 shipments and additional capacity for fiscal year 2007 as we rampup capacity for production of new seagatedesigned disc drive products in fiscal year 2007 we expect that our investment in property equipment and leasehold improvements will be up to 13 billion the increased capital spending is intended to support our continued growth technology advances and meet market demand for our products 

  

net cash used in investing activities was approximately 11 billion and 962 million for fiscal years 2005 and 2004 respectively and was primarily attributable to expenditures for property equipment and leasehold improvements and the purchases of shortterm investments in excess of maturities and sales thereof specifically during fiscal year 2005 we invested approximately 691 million in property equipment and leasehold improvements comprised of 

  

   

   

   

   

cash used in financing activities 

  

net cash used in financing activities of 732 million for fiscal year 2006 was primarily attributable to 399 million used in the repurchases of common shares the repayment of a 340 million term loan and 155 million of dividends paid to our shareholders partially offset by 118 million in cash provided by employee stock option exercises and employee stock purchases 

  

net cash used in financing activities of 35 million for fiscal year 2005 was primarily attributable to dividends of 122 million paid to our shareholders and principal payments on our senior secured credit facilities offset by 90 million in cash provided by employee stock option exercises and employee stock purchases 

  

net cash used in financing activities for fiscal year 2004 was zero and was primarily attributable to dividends totaling 90 million paid to our shareholders and principal payments on our senior secured credit facilities completely offset by 96 million in cash provided by employee stock option exercises and employee stock purchases 

  

liquidity sources and cash requirements and commitments 

  

our principal sources of liquidity as of june 30 2006 consisted of 1 approximately 17 billion in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments 2 cash we expect to generate from operations and 3 a 100 million revolving credit facility 

  

we have a 100 million revolving credit facility that matures in november 2008 the revolving credit facility is available for cash borrowings and for the issuance of letters of credit up to 100 million although no borrowings have been drawn under this revolving credit facility to date we had utilized 31 million for outstanding letters of credit and bankers’ guarantees as of june 30 2006 leaving 69 million of available capacity for additional letters of credit or cash borrowings subject to compliance with financial covenants and other customary conditions to borrowing seagate had other uncommitted unsecured credit lines totaling 21 million at june 30 2006 which are available to support letters of credit bank guarantees and overdraft facilities as of june 30 2006 a total of 8 million of letters of credit and bank guarantees was outstanding under these facilities 

  

the credit agreement that governs our revolving credit facility contains covenants that we must satisfy in order to remain in compliance with the agreement this credit agreement contains three financial covenants 1 minimum cash cash equivalents and marketable securities 2 a fixed charge coverage ratio and 3 a net leverage ratio as of june 30 2006 we are in compliance with all covenants 

  

our principal liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital research and development and capital expenditure needs to service our debt including debt assumed from maxtor and in connection with the maxtor acquisition the company anticipates restructuring and other merger related cash charges of approximately 500 million in addition since the second half of fiscal year 2002 and through fiscal year 2006 we have paid dividends to our shareholders 

  

during fiscal year 2006 we paid dividends aggregating approximately 155 million or 032 per share to our common shareholders of record as of august 5 2005 november 4 2005 february 3 2006 and may 5 2006 on august 8 2006 we declared a quarterly dividend of 008 per share that was paid on september 1 2006 to our common shareholders of record as of august 18 2006 in deciding whether or not to declare quarterly dividends our directors will take into account such factors as general business conditions within the disc drive industry our financial results our capital requirements contractual and legal restrictions on the payment of dividends by our subsidiaries to us or by us to our shareholders the impact of paying dividends on our credit ratings and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant 

  

as a result of the maxtor acquisition we assumed all debts and liabilities of maxtor corporation together with cash and shortterm investments and any consolidated indebtedness of maxtor corporation outstanding at may 19 2006 including without limitation its outstanding convertible senior notes which were consolidated with our indebtedness for financial reporting purposes following the acquisition we will require additional amounts of cash to fund scheduled payments of principal and interest on maxtor’s indebtedness which could limit our financial flexibility in addition maxtor’s 2375 convertible senior notes due august 2012 one of the series of notes which were assumed by seagate following the acquisition and of which 326 million were outstanding as of june 30 2006 contain a cash conversion feature that will require seagate to deliver the holders upon any conversion of these notes cash in an amount equal to the lesser of a the principal amount of the notes converted and b the asconverted value of the notes to the extent holders of the maxtor notes choose to convert their notes following the acquisition seagate will require additional amounts of cash to meet this obligation 

  

in october 2005 our board authorized the use of up to 400 million for the repurchase of our outstanding common shares during the quarter ended june 30 2006 the company repurchased a total of approximately 167 million common shares for approximately 400 million all of which were retired and therefore not available for reissue in july 2006 our board of directors approved an additional share repurchase of up to 25 billion of our common shares over the next two years we expect to fund the share repurchase through a combination of cash on hand future cash flow from operations and other sources of financing such as additional debt share repurchases under this program may be made through a variety of methods which may include open market purchases privately negotiated transactions block trades accelerated share repurchase transactions or otherwise or by any combination of such methods the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including the share price corporate and regulatory requirements other market and economic conditions and sources of liquidity the share repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time 

  

in addition as part of our strategy we may selectively pursue strategic alliances acquisitions and investments that are complementary to our business any material future acquisitions alliances or investments will likely require additional capital we may enter into more of these types of arrangements in the future which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all we will require substantial amounts of cash to fund scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness future capital expenditures any increased working capital requirements and share repurchases if we are unable to meet our cash requirements out of existing cash or cash flow from operations we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain alternative financing on terms acceptable to us if at all 

  

we believe that our sources of cash will be sufficient to fund our operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months our ability to fund these requirements and comply with the financial covenants under our debt agreements will depend on our future operations performance and cash flow and is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial business and other factors some of which are beyond our control 

  

contractual obligations and commitments 

  

our contractual cash obligations and commitments as of june 30 2006 have been summarized in the table below in millions 

  

    

   

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

as of june 30 2006 we did not have any material offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of regulation sk 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

the methods estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements the sec has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are highly uncertain at the time of estimation based on this definition our most critical policies include establishment of sales program accruals establishment of warranty accruals valuation of deferred tax assets as well as the valuation of intangibles and goodwill below we discuss these policies further as well as the estimates and judgments involved we also have other key accounting policies and accounting estimates relating to uncollectible customer accounts valuation of inventory valuation of sharebased payments and acquisition related restructuring we believe that these other accounting policies and accounting estimates either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective or it is less likely that they would have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period 

  

establishment of sales program accruals we establish certain distributor and oem sales programs aimed at increasing customer demand these programs are typically related to a distributor’s level of sales order size advertising or point of sale activity or an oem’s level of sale activity or agreed upon rebate programs we provide for these obligations at the time that revenue is recorded based on estimated requirements these estimates are based on various factors including estimated future price erosion customer orders and sellthrough levels program participation customer claim submittals and sales returns during periods in which our distributors’ inventories of our products are at higher than historical levels such as the second quarter of fiscal year 2004 our estimates upon which our recorded contrarevenue is based are subject to a greater degree of subjectivity and the potential for actual results to vary is accordingly higher currently our distributors’ 

  

inventories are within the historical range significant actual variations in any of the factors upon which we base our estimates could have a material effect on our operating results in addition our failure to accurately predict the level of future sales returns by our distribution customers could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

establishment of warranty accruals we estimate probable product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized we generally warrant our products for a period of one to five years we use estimated repair or replacement costs and use statistical modeling to estimate product return rates in order to determine our warranty obligation we exercise judgment in determining the underlying estimates our judgment is subject to a greater degree of subjectivity with respect to newly introduced products because of a lack of past experience with those products upon which to base our estimates we continually introduce new products and have recently begun a shift to disc drive products that utilize perpendicular recording technology if the actual rate of unit failures is significantly different than what we used in estimating the warranty expense accrual we would need to adjust our warranty accrual and our results of operations could be materially affected we also exercise judgment in estimating our ability to sell certain repaired disc drives to the extent such sales fall below our forecast warranty cost will be adversely impacted 

  

valuation of deferred tax assets the recording of our deferred tax assets each period depends primarily on our ability to generate current and future taxable income in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions each period we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and we adjust the valuation allowance so that we record net deferred tax assets only to the extent that we conclude it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized with the acquisition of maxtor the realizability of us deferred tax assets was determined on a consolidated return basis as a result maxtor’s deferred tax assets that were determined to be realizable were recorded as a reduction of goodwill and seagate deferred tax assets that were determined to be no longer realizable were written off with a charge to income tax expense at the date of acquisition 

  

valuation of intangible assets and goodwill in accordance with the provisions of statement of sfas no 141 business combinations “sfas 141” the purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired business based on their estimated fair values with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill we engaged thirdparty appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed such valuations require management to make significant judgments estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from and economic lives of existing technology customer relationships trade names and other intangible assets and discount rates unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results 

  

we are required to periodically evaluate the carrying values of our intangible assets for impairment if any of our intangible assets are determined to be impaired we may have to writedown the impaired asset and our earnings would be adversely impacted in the period that occurs 

  

at june 30 2006 our goodwill totaled approximately 25 billion and our identifiable intangible assets totaled 307 million in accordance with the provisions of sfas 142 goodwill and other intangible assets “sfas 142 we assess the impairment of goodwill at least annually or more often if warranted by events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying value may exceed its fair value this assessment requires the projection and discounting of cash flows analysis of our market capitalization and estimating the fair values of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities estimating future cash flows and determining their present values are based upon among other things certain assumptions about expected future operating performance and appropriate discount rates determined by our management our estimates of cash flows may differ from actual 

  

cash flows due to among other things economic conditions changes to the business model or changes in operating performance significant differences between these estimates and actual cash flows could materially affect our future financial results 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

in november 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 151 “inventory costs” “sfas 151” sfas 151 amends accounting research bulletin no 43 chapter 4 “inventory pricing” this statement clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and wasted material and requires those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of “so abnormal” additionally sfas 151 requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities we adopted sfas 151 in our first quarter of fiscal year 2006 the adoption of sfas 151 did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position however sfas 151 may have a more significant impact as we wind down the volume of maxtordesigned disc drive products resulting in an inefficient use of the maxtor manufacturing infrastructure 

  

effective july 2 2005 we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” “sfas 123r” using the modifiedprospectivetransition method except for options granted prior to the initial filing of our registration statement on form s1 in october 2002 as a result we have included stockbased compensation costs in our results of operations for fiscal year 2006 see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report the adoption of sfas 123r had a material impact on our results of operations 

  

in february 2006 the financial accounting standards board or fasb issued sfas no 155 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments  which amends sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and sfas no 140 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities sfas no 155 simplifies the accounting for certain derivatives embedded in other financial instruments by allowing them to be accounted for as a whole if the holder elects to account for the entire instrument on a fair value basis sfas no 155 also clarifies and amends certain other provisions of sfas no 133 and sfas no 140 sfas no 155 is effective for all financial instruments acquired issued or subject to a remeasurement event occurring in fiscal years beginning after september 15 2006 earlier adoption is permitted provided the company has not yet issued financial statements including for interim periods for that fiscal year the company does not expect the adoption of sfas no 155 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

in june 2006 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no fin 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fasb statement no 109  this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 109 accounting for income taxes  this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 and will be adopted by us in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008 we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of fin 48 will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

  

   

interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and longterm debt we currently do not use derivative financial instruments in either our investment portfolio or to hedge debt 

  

as stated in our investment policy we are averse to principal loss and ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk we mitigate default risk by maintaining portfolio investments in diversified highquality investment grade securities with limited time to maturity we constantly monitor our investment portfolio and position our portfolio to respond appropriately to a reduction in credit rating of any investment issuer guarantor or depository we maintain a highly liquid portfolio by investing only in marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets 

  

we have both fixed and variable rate debt obligations we enter into debt obligations to support general corporate purposes including capital expenditures and working capital needs we currently do not use interest rate derivatives to hedge our interest rate exposure 

  

at june 30 2006 the company had 58 million in marketable securities that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for a period greater than twelve months the unrealized loss on these marketable securities was immaterial 

  

the table below presents principal or notional amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio and debt obligations as of june 30 2006 all investments mature in three years or less 

  

   

foreign currency exchange risk we transact business in various foreign countries our primary foreign currency cash flows are in emerging market countries in asia and in european countries in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004 we instituted a foreign currency hedging program to protect against the increase in value of foreign currency cash flows resulting from expenses over the next year we hedge portions of our forecasted expenses denominated in foreign currencies with forward exchange contracts when the us dollar weakens significantly against the foreign currencies the increase in the value of the future foreign currency expenditure is offset by gains in the value of the forward contracts designated as hedges conversely as the us dollar strengthens the decrease in value of the future foreign currency cash flows is offset by losses in the value of the 

  

forward contracts these forward foreign exchange contracts carried at fair value may have maturities between one and twelve months the maximum original duration of forward foreign exchange contracts is twelve months 

  

we evaluate hedging effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively and record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in other income expense on the statement of operations we did not have any net gains losses recognized in other income expense for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness in fiscal years 2006 2005 and 2004 

  

as of june 30 2006 our notional amount of foreign exchange forward contracts totaled 59 million we do not believe that these derivatives present significant credit risks because the counterparties to the derivatives consist of major financial institutions and we manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with any one counterparty we maintain settlement and revaluation limits as well as maximum tenure of contracts based on the credit rating of the financial institutions we do not enter derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes the table below provides information as of june 30 2006 about our derivative financial instruments comprised of foreign currency forward exchange contracts the table is provided in us dollar equivalent amounts and presents the notional amounts at the contract exchange rates and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission or coso we have excluded from our evaluation the internal control over financial reporting of maxtor corporation and subsidiaries which we acquired on may 19 2006 and is included in the fiscal year 2006 consolidated financial statements of seagate technology and constituted 41 billion and 20 billion of total and net assets respectively as of june 30 2006 and 279 million and 143 million of revenues and net loss respectively for the year then ended 

  

based on our evaluation under the framework in internal control — integrated framework  our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of june 30 2006 our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2006 has been audited by ernst  young llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report that is included herein 

  

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

  

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our fourth fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

  

limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

  

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal controls have been designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within seagate have been detected an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of june 30 2006 based on that evaluation our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level

 item 1 business 

  

we are a leader in the design manufacturing and marketing of rigid disc drives rigid disc drives which are commonly referred to as disc drives or hard drives are used as the primary medium for storing electronic information in systems ranging from desktop and notebook computers and consumer electronics devices to data centers delivering information over corporate networks and the internet we produce a broad range of disc drive products that make us a leader in the industry with products addressing enterprise applications where our products are used in enterprise servers mainframes and workstations desktop applications where our products are used in desktop computers mobile computing applications where our products are used in notebook computers and consumer electronics applications where our products are used in a wide variety of devices such as digital video recorders digital music players and gaming devices 

  

we sell our disc drives primarily to major original equipment manufacturers or oems and also market to distributors under our globally recognized brand name for fiscal years 2005 2004 and 2003 approximately 72 64 and 63 respectively of our disc drive revenue was from sales to oems including customers such as hewlettpackard dell ibm emc and apple we have longstanding relationships with many of these oem customers we also have key relationships with major distributors who sell our disc drive products to small oems dealers system integrators and retailers throughout most of the world also we are currently expanding our direct sales to retailers for fiscal years 2005 2004 and 2003 approximately 31 29 and 33 respectively of our disc drive revenue came from customers located in north america approximately 28 33 and 31 respectively came from customers located in europe and approximately 41 38 and 36 respectively came from customers located in the far east substantially all of our revenue is denominated in us dollars 

  

industry 

  

demand for electronic data storage 

  

we believe that the amount of data stored and accessed electronically is growing rapidly and that there are a number of key factors driving this demand we are particularly focused on three areas of growing demand for disc drives 

  

growth in disc drives for consumer electronics  highperformance computing and communications functions and increasingly disc drives are being incorporated into consumer electronics devices such as digital video recorders digital music players video game consoles and advanced television settop boxes in addition faster connections to the internet and increased broadband capacity have encouraged consumers to download greater amounts of text video and audio data expanding the market for disc drives for use in new consumer and entertainment appliances the adoption and rapid growth of the use of disc drives in these applications will be facilitated by the development of lowcost disc drives that meet the pricing requirements of the consumer electronics market 

  

growth in disc drives for mobile computing the mobile computing market is expected to grow faster than any other personal computer segment as price and performance continue to improve placing notebook computers in an attractive position relative to desktop computers notebook systems are increasingly becoming replacement systems to desktop computers and progressively more desirable to consumers as the need for mobility increases and wireless adoption continues to advance in the united states the sale of notebook computers recently exceeded that of desktop computers 

  

growth of storage area networks and network attached storage  the need to address the dramatic expansion in data storage management requirements has spurred the evolution of new storage and data management technologies enterprises are increasingly offloading network traffic to dedicated storage area networks or sans in addition many enterprises are moving away from the use of serverattached storage to networkattached storage or nas these solutions combine highperformance storage products that are comprised principally of disc drives with sophisticated software and communications technologies we expect that the market for these solutions will grow rapidly and will result in greater opportunities for the sale of highperformance highcapacity disc drives 

  

an emerging application in enterprise storage is the use of nearline storage systems these systems use higher capacity disc drives to access less frequently needed data 

  

success in our industry depends on technology and manufacturing leadership 

  

the design and manufacturing of disc drives depends on highly advanced technology and manufacturing techniques especially in the areas of readwrite heads and recording media disc drive manufacturers are distinguished by their level of integration which is the degree to which they control the technology used in their products and by whether they are captive producing disc drives for their own computer systems or independent producing disc drives as a standalone product integrated manufacturers are companies that design and produce the critical technologies including readwrite heads and recording media used in their disc drives an integrated approach enables them to lower manufacturing costs and to improve the functionality of components so that they work together efficiently in contrast manufacturers that are not integrated purchase most of their components from thirdparty suppliers upon whom they depend for key elements of their technological innovation and differentiation this can limit their ability to coordinate technology roadmaps and optimize the component design process for manufacturing efficiency and product reliability while making them reliant on the technology investment decisions of their suppliers independent manufacturers can enjoy a competitive advantage over captive manufacturers in working with oems because they do not compete with oems for computer system sales 

  

due to the significant challenges posed by the need to continually innovate and improve manufacturing efficiency the disc drive industry has undergone significant consolidation as manufacturers and merchant component suppliers merged with other companies or exited the industry consolidation is likely to continue in our industry as the technological challenges and the associated levels of required investment grow increasing the competitive necessity of largescale operations we believe the competitive dynamics of the disc drive industry favor integrated independent manufacturers with the scale to make substantial technology investments and apply them across a broad product portfolio and set of customers 

  

overview of disc drive technology 

  

all disc drives incorporate the same basic technology although individual products vary one or more discs are attached to a spindle assembly powered by a spindle motor that rotates the discs at a high constant speed around a hub the discs or recording media are the components on which data is stored and from which it is retrieved each disc typically consists of a substrate of finely machined aluminum or glass with a layer of a thinfilm magnetic material readwrite heads mounted on an arm assembly similar in concept to that of a record player fly extremely close to each disc surface and record data on and retrieve it from concentric tracks in the magnetic layers of the rotating discs the readwrite heads are mounted vertically on an eshaped assembly the eblock and the recording media are mounted inside a metal casing called the base casting 

  

upon instructions from the drive’s electronic circuitry a head positioning mechanism or actuator guides the heads to the selected track of a disc where the data is recorded or retrieved application specific integrated circuits or asics and ancillary electronic control chips are collectively mounted on printed circuit boards asics move data to and from the readwrite head and the internal controller or interface which communicates with the host computer disc drive manufacturers typically use one or more of several industry standard interfaces such as advanced technology architecture or ata serial ata which provides higher data transfer rates than the previous ata standard small computer system interface or scsi serial attached scsi or sas and fibre channel 

  

disc drive performance is commonly assessed by six key characteristics 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

areal density is a measure of storage capacity per square inch on the recording surface of a disc current areal densities are sufficient to meet the requirements of most applications today although the rate of increase in areal density is slowing we expect the longterm demand for increased drive capacities to continue to increase as audio and visual data require many multiples of the storage capacity of simple text we have pursued and expect to continue to pursue a range of technologies to increase areal densities across the entire range of our products to increase disc drive capacities and to enable the production of higher capacity smaller form factor disc drives for example in june 2005 we announced a product that utilizes perpendicular recording technology in which data bits are oriented vertically on the disc platter perpendicular to the disc surface rather than flat to the surface as with existing longitudinal recording as a result of the transition to perpendicular recording there is a need to increase the thickness of the recording materials and increase the complexity of the readwrite head technology furthermore perpendicular recording technology requires a complex interplay between the readwrite heads the recording media the asics and the disc drive software we believe that because of our vertical design and manufacturing strategy we are well suited to meet the challenges that such close dependence of components for our disc drives using perpendicular recording require 

  

manufacturing 

  

we pursue an integrated business strategy based on the ownership of critical component technologies this strategy allows us to maintain control over our product roadmap and component cost quality and availability our manufacturing efficiency and flexibility is a critical element of our integrated business strategy during the past several years we have made significant improvements in our manufacturing efficiency by 

  

   

   

   

   

   

manufacturing our disc drives is a complex process that begins with the production of individual components and ends with a fully assembled unit we design assemble andor manufacture a number of the most important components found in our disc drives including readwrite heads recording media printed circuit boards spindle motors and asics 

  

readwrite heads  the function of the readwrite head is to scan across the disc as it spins magnetically recording or reading information the tolerances of recording heads are extremely demanding and require stateoftheart equipment and processes our readwrite heads are manufactured with thinfilm and photolithographic processes similar to those used to produce semiconductor integrated circuits beginning with sixinch round ceramic wafers we process more than 25000 head elements at one time each of these head elements goes through more than 300 steps all in clean room environments our readwrite heads require highly advanced processes with tolerances approaching the thickness of a single atom we perform all primary stages of design and manufacture of readwrite heads at our facilities although the percentage of our requirements for readwrite heads that we produce internally varies periodically we currently manufacture all of our readwrite heads with perpendicular recording expected to eventually replace longitudinal recording the tolerances and complexity of recording heads will be even more demanding in future generation products however because perpendicular recording utilizes existing capital equipment to manufacture readwrite heads we do not believe additional capital investment will be required 

  

recording media  the function of the recording media is to magnetically store information the domains where each bit of magnetic code is stored are extremely small and precisely placed as a result the manufacturing of recording media requires sophisticated thinfilm processes each disc is a sequentially processed set of layers that consist of structural magnetic protective and lubricating materials once complete the disc must have a high degree of physical uniformity to assure reliable and errorfree storage we purchase aluminum substrate blanks for recording media production from third parties mainly in japan these blanks are machined plated and polished to produce finished substrates at our plant in northern ireland we also purchase all of our glass substrates from third parties in japan in manufacturing our disc drives used in mobile and small form factor consumer electronics products the percentage of our requirements for recording media that we produce internally varies from quarter to quarter we continue to expand our media production facility in singapore to further increase our production capacity our strategy is to purchase no more than 20 of our recording media requirements from thirdparty suppliers in any given quarter although the increased thickness of the recording media required by perpendicular recording technology could have a negative effect upon our manufacturing throughput we believe we have compensated for this effect by investing in advanced manufacturing technologies 

  

printed circuit boards  we assemble and test a significant portion of the printed circuit boards used in our disc drives printed circuit boards are the boards that contain the electronic circuitry and asics that provide the electronic controls of the disc drive and on which the headdisc assembly is mounted we assemble printed circuit boards at our facilities in malaysia and china 

  

spindle motors  we participate in the design of many of our spindle motors and purchase them principally from outside vendors in asia whom we have licensed to use our intellectual property and technology 

  

asics  we participate in the design of many of the asics used in our disc drives for motor and actuator control such as interface controllers readwrite channels and preamplifiers we do not manufacture any asics but rather buy them from thirdparty suppliers 

  

following the production of the individual components of the disc drive the first step in the manufacture of a disc drive itself is the assembly of the actuator arm readwrite heads discs and spindle motor in a housing to form the headdisc assembly the production of the headdisc assembly involves largely automated processes 

  

printed circuit boards are then mated to the headdisc assembly and the completed unit is tested prior to packaging and shipment final assembly and test operations of our disc drives occur primarily at facilities located in china singapore and thailand we perform subassembly and component manufacturing operations at our facilities in china malaysia northern ireland singapore thailand and in the united states in california and minnesota in addition third parties manufacture and assemble components for us in various asian countries including china japan korea malaysia the philippines singapore taiwan thailand and vietnam and in europe and the united states 

  

products 

  

we offer a broad range of disc drive products for the enterprise desktop mobile computing and consumer electronics sectors of the disc drive industry during fiscal year 2005 we introduced and shipped in volume 12 new disc drive products including 

  

   

   

   

   

we offer more than one product within each product family and differentiate products on the basis of priceperformance and form factor or the dimensions of the disc drive historically our industry has been characterized by continuous and significant advances in technology which contributed to rapid product life cycles however based upon the recent pace of new product introductions we believe that our industry is currently in a period in which the rate of increases in areal density which is the storage capacity per square inch on a disc is lower than the rate of the last several years resulting in longer product life cycles we list in the table below our main current product offerings 

  

   

in june 2005 we further broadened our product offering with the announcement of 10 new disc drive products which will be introduced in fiscal year 2006 including

customers 

  

we sell our disc drive products primarily to major oems and distributors oem customers incorporate our disc drives into computer systems and storage systems for resale distributors typically sell our disc drives to small oems dealers system integrators and other resellers shipments to oems were approximately 72 64 and 63 of our disc drive revenue in fiscal years 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively shipments to distributors were approximately 26 35 and 37 of our disc drive revenue in fiscal years 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively sales to hewlettpackard accounted for approximately 18 19 and 18 of our disc drive revenue in fiscal years 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively while sales to dell as a percentage of our disc drive revenue were 12 in fiscal year 2005 no other customer accounted for 10 or more of our disc drive revenue in fiscal years 2005 2004 and 2003 retail sales in fiscal year 2005 as a percentage of our disc drive revenue increased to 17 from 09 and 01 in fiscal years 2004 and 2003 respectively see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—risk factors—risks related to our business—dependence on key customers—we may be adversely affected by the loss of or reduced delayed or cancelled purchases by one or more of our larger customers” 

  

oem customers typically enter into master purchase agreements with us these agreements provide for pricing volume discounts order lead times product support obligations and other terms and conditions the term of these agreements is usually 12 to 36 months although our product support obligations generally extend substantially beyond this period these master agreements typically do not commit the customer to buy any minimum quantity of products or create exclusive relationships deliveries are scheduled only after receipt of purchase orders in addition with limited leadtime customers may cancel or defer most purchase orders without significant penalty anticipated orders from many of our customers have in the past failed to materialize or oem delivery schedules have been deferred or altered as a result of changes in their business needs 

  

our distributors generally enter into nonexclusive agreements for the redistribution of our products they typically furnish us with a nonbinding indication of their nearterm requirements and product deliveries are generally scheduled based on a weekly confirmation by the distributor of its requirements for that week the agreements typically provide the distributors with price protection with respect to their inventory of our disc drives at the time of a reduction by us in our selling price for the disc drives and also provide limited rights to return the product 

  

we also regularly enter into agreements with our customers which obligate us to provide a limited indemnity against losses resulting from intellectual property claims these agreements are customary in our industry and typically require us to indemnify our customer against certain damages and costs incurred as a result of third party intellectual property claims arising as a result of their use of our products 

  

sales marketing and customer service 

  

our sales organization focuses on deepening our relationship with our customers the worldwide sales group focuses on geographic coverage of oems and distributors throughout most of the world the worldwide sales group is organized regionally among north america japan asiapacific excluding japan and europe africa and the middle east in addition we have a sales operation group which focuses on aligning our production levels with customers’ product requirements our sales force works directly with our marketing organization to coordinate our oem and distribution channel relationships we maintain sales offices throughout the united states and in australia china england france germany india ireland japan singapore and taiwan

foreign sales are subject to foreign exchange controls and other restrictions including in the case of some countries approval by the office of export administration of the us department of commerce and other us governmental agencies 

  

competition 

  

the disc drive industry is intensely competitive with manufacturers competing for a limited number of major customers some of the principal factors used by customers to differentiate among disc drive manufacturers are 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we believe that our products are competitive with respect to each of these factors in the markets that we currently address we summarize below our principal competitors the effect of competition on price erosion for our products and product life cycles and technology 

  

principal competitors  we have experienced and expect to continue to experience intense competition from a number of domestic and foreign companies some of which have greater financial and other resources than we have these competitors include other independent disc drive manufacturers such as maxtor and western digital as well as large captive manufacturers such as fujitsu hitachi global storage technologies samsung and toshiba because they produce complete computer systems captive manufacturers can derive a greater portion of their operating margins from other components which reduces their need to realize a profit on the disc drives included in their computer systems and allows them to sell disc drives to third parties at very low margins many captive manufacturers are also formidable competitors because they have more substantial resources and greater access to their internal customers than we do in addition hitachi global storage technologies together with affiliated entities and samsung electronics incorporated also sell other products to our customers including critical components like flash memory applicationspecific integrated circuits or asics and flat panel displays and may be willing to sell their disc drives at a lower margin to advance their overall business strategy 

  

we also face indirect competition from present and potential customers who continually evaluate whether to manufacture their own disc drives and other information storage products or purchase them from outside sources other than us these manufacturers also sell disc drives to third parties which results in direct competition with us we expect that continued consolidation both among independent manufacturers and among captive manufacturers will increase the threat posed to our business by these competitors during the last few years three additional competitors have entered the market cornice and gs magicstor offering 1inch disc drives and excelstor as a contract manufacturer of desktop disc drives 

  

recently with respect to our lower capacity smaller form factor disc drives such as our st1 used in handheld consumer electronics devices such as digital music players digital cameras and digital video cameras we have also started to experience competition from other companies that produce alternative storage technologies like flash memory 

  

price erosion  our competitors have historically offered new or existing products at lower prices as part of a strategy to gain or retain market share and customers and we expect these practices to continue even during periods when demand for disc drives is growing our industry is price competitive and vendors experience price erosion over the life of a product such price erosion has increased as product life cycles have lengthened due to a slowing in the rate of increase in areal density this slowing of the areal density curve may contribute to 

  

increases in average price erosion to the extent that historical price erosion patterns continue product life cycles are lengthened our competitors have more time to enter the market for a particular product and we are unable to offset this with new products at higher average prices we expect that price erosion in our industry will continue for the foreseeable future to remain competitive we believe it will be necessary to continue to reduce our prices as well as introduce new product offerings in advance of our competitors to take advantage of potentially higher initial profit margins on these product introductions we have established production facilities in china malaysia singapore and thailand to achieve cost reductions 

  

product life cycles and changing technology  historically competition and changing customer preference and demand in the disc drive industry have shortened product life cycles and caused acceleration in the development and introduction of new technology based on the recent pace of new product introductions however we believe that the current rate of increase in areal density is slowing from the rate of the last several years and the resulting variability in product life cycles may make planning for product transitions more difficult we believe that our future success will depend upon our ability to develop manufacture and market products of high quality and reliability which meet changing user needs and which successfully anticipate or respond to changes in technology and standards on a costeffective and timely basis 

  

research and development 

  

we are committed to developing new component technologies and products and evaluating alternative storage technologies we have increased our focus on research and development and realigned our disc drive development process this structured product process is designed to bring new products to market through predictable and repeatable methodologies seagate research which is based in pittsburgh pennsylvania is dedicated to extending the capacity of magnetic and optical recording and exploring alternative data storage technologies including perpendicular recording technology and heat assisted magnetic recording technology perpendicular recording technology involves a different orientation for the magnetic field than is currently used in disc drives and heat assisted magnetic recording technology uses heat generated by a laser to improve storage capacity our advanced technology integration effort focuses disc drive and component research on recording subsystems including readwrite heads and recording media marketspecific product technology as well as technology focused towards new business opportunities the primary purpose of our advanced technology integration effort is to ensure timely availability of mature component technologies to our product development teams as well as allowing us to leverage and coordinate those technologies in the design centers across our products in order to take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace during fiscal years 2005 2004 and 2003 we had product development expenses of 645 million 666 million and 670 million respectively 

  

patents and licenses 

  

as of july 1 2005 we had approximately 2710 us patents and 501 patents issued in various foreign jurisdictions as well as approximately 1027 us and 766 foreign patent applications pending the number of patents and patent applications will vary at any given time as part of our ongoing patent portfolio management activity due to the rapid technological change that characterizes the information storage industry we believe that the improvement of existing products reliance upon trade secret law the protection of unpatented proprietary knowhow and development of new products are generally more important than patent protection in establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage nevertheless we believe that patents are valuable to our business and intend to continue our efforts to obtain patents where available in connection with our research and development program 

  

the information storage industry is characterized by significant litigation relating to patent and other intellectual property rights because of rapid technological development in the information storage industry some of our products have been and in the future could be alleged to infringe existing patents of third parties from time to time we receive claims that our products infringe patents of third parties although we have been able to resolve some of those claims or potential claims by obtaining licenses or rights under the patents in question without a material adverse affect on us other claims have resulted in adverse decisions or settlements 

  

in addition other claims are pending which if resolved unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations for more information on these claims see “item 3 legal proceedings” the costs of engaging in intellectual property litigation may be substantial regardless of the merit of the claim or the outcome we have patent crosslicenses with a number of companies additionally as part of our normal intellectual property practices we are engaged in negotiations with other major disc drive companies and component manufacturers with respect to ongoing patent crosslicenses for a discussion of the related risks see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—risk factors—risks related to our business—potential loss of licensed technology—the closing of the november 2000 transactions may have triggered change of control or antiassignment provisions in some of our license agreements which could result in a loss of our right to use licensed technology” 

  

backlog 

  

in view of customers’ rights to cancel or defer orders with little or no penalty we believe backlog in the disc drive industry is of limited indicative value in estimating future performance and results 

  

employees 

  

at july 1 2005 we employed approximately 44000 persons worldwide of which approximately 35000 employees were located in our asian operations in addition we make use of temporary employees principally in manufacturing who are hired on an asneeded basis we believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees at all levels and even then we cannot assure you of any such success we believe that our employee relations are good 

  

environmental matters 

  

our operations are subject to comprehensive us and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites some of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution and these permits are subject to modification renewal and revocation by issuing authorities 

  

we believe that our operations are currently in substantial compliance with all environmental laws regulations and permits we incur operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental laws if additional or more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future we could incur additional operating costs and capital expenditures 

  

some environmental laws such as the us federal superfund law and similar state statutes can impose liability for the cost of cleanup of contaminated sites upon any of the current or former site owners or operators or upon parties who sent waste to these sites regardless of whether the owner or operator owned the site at the time of the release of hazardous substances or the lawfulness of the original disposal activity we have been identified as a potentially responsible party at several superfund sites at each of these sites the government has assigned to us a portion of the financial liability based on the type and amount of hazardous substances disposed of by each party at the site and the number of financially viable parties 

  

some of our current and former sites have a history of commercial and industrial operations including the use of hazardous substances groundwater and soil contamination resulting from historical operations has been identified at several of our current and former facilities and we are addressing the cleanup of these sites in cooperation with the relevant government agencies 

  

while our ultimate costs in connection with these sites is difficult to predict with complete accuracy based on our current estimates of cleanup costs and our expected allocation of these costs we do not expect costs in connection with these superfund sites and contaminated sites to be material 

  

executive officers and directors

the closing price of our common shares as reported by the new york stock exchange on july 26 2005 was 1874 per share as of july 26 2005 there were approximately 892 holders of record of our common shares we did not sell any of our equity securities during fiscal year 2005 that were not registered under the securities act of 1933 as amended 

  

dividends 

  

on march 4 2005 our board of directors approved the increase of our quarterly dividend from 006 per share to no more than 008 per share up to 032 per share annually so long as the aggregate amount of the dividend does not exceed 50 of our cumulative consolidated net income plus 100 of net cash proceeds received from the issuance of capital all of which are measured from the period beginning june 30 2001 and ending the most recent fiscal quarter in which financial statements are internally available 

  

we are restricted in our ability to pay dividends by the covenants contained in the indenture governing our senior notes and the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities our declaration of dividends is also subject to cayman islands law and the discretion of our board of directors in deciding whether or not to declare quarterly dividends our directors will take into account such factors as general business conditions within the disc drive industry our financial results our capital requirements contractual and legal restrictions on the payment of dividends by our subsidiaries to us or by us to our shareholders the impact of paying dividends on our credit ratings and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant 

  

since the closing of our initial public offering in december 2002 we have paid dividends pursuant to our quarterly dividend policy totaling approximately 238 million in the aggregate 

  

   

on july 19 2005 we declared a dividend of 008 per share to be paid on or before august 19 2005 to our shareholders of record as of august 5 2005 

  

to the extent that the amount of any distribution exceeds our current or accumulated earnings and profits for us federal income tax purposes in any taxable year the distribution will be treated as a return of capital for us tax purposes causing a reduction in a shareholder’s adjusted tax basis in the common shares because we did not have any current or accumulated earnings and profits for us federal income tax purposes for our taxable year ended july 1 2005 distributions on our common shares during this period were treated as a return of capital rather than dividend income for us federal income tax purposes there can be no assurance however that we will not have current or accumulated earnings and profits for us federal income tax purposes in future years to the extent that we have current or accumulated earnings and profits for us federal income tax purposes distributions on our common shares will not be treated as a return of capital distribution and will be treated as dividend income taxable to us shareholders if during fiscal year 2006 we engage in activities such as the repayment of our term loan the repurchase of our common shares etc which require significant usage of cash beyond the normal quarterly distributions to shareholders it is likely that we would generate current earnings and profits if this occurs all distributions made during fiscal year 2006 are anticipated to be treated as dividend income even if the activities occur after the distributions are made 

  

furthermore we believe that we were a foreign personal holding company for us federal income tax purposes for our taxable years ended july 1 2005 and july 2 2004 pursuant to the american jobs creation act of 2004 foreign corporations will be excluded from the application of the personal holding company rules of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” effective for taxable years of foreign corporations beginning after december 31 2004 for the company the effective date is its fiscal year beginning july 2 2005 as a result if taxable distributions on our common shares are made after july 1 2005 us shareholders who are individuals may be eligible for reduced rates of taxation applicable to certain dividend income currently a maximum rate of 15 on distributions made after the effective date

november 2000 transactions 

  

prior to november 22 2000 suez acquisition company the predecessor to new sac entered into a stock purchase agreement with seagate delaware and seagate software holdings inc a subsidiary of seagate delaware concurrently seagate delaware and veritas software corporation which is now a whollyowned subsidiary of symantec corporation “veritas” entered into an agreement and plan of merger and reorganization suez acquisition company was an exempted company incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the cayman islands and formed solely for the purpose of entering into the stock purchase agreement and undertaking the related acquisitions suez acquisition company later assigned all of its rights and obligations under the stock purchase agreement to new sac an exempted company incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the cayman islands and formed for the same purpose 

  

an indemnification agreement provided that new sac and its subsidiaries would be required to indemnify veritas and its affiliates for specified liabilities of seagate delaware and seagate software holdings inc including selected taxes in return veritas seagate delaware and their affiliates agreed to indemnify new sac and its subsidiaries for specified liabilities including all taxes of seagate delaware for which new sac would not be obligated to indemnify veritas and its affiliates veritas deposited 150 million in an escrow account which could be applied by new sac to satisfy certain tax liabilities and which remained in the escrow account in full to the extent that any part of the 150 million was not utilized to satisfy these tax liabilities it would be paid out to the former seagate delaware stockholders in july 2002 we and those of our affiliates that were parties to the indemnification agreement entered into a reimbursement agreement which allocated the respective liabilities and obligations under the indemnification agreement 

  

under the reimbursement agreement if we and our affiliates became obligated to indemnify seagate delaware veritas or any of their affiliates for tax liabilities under the indemnification agreement seagate technology hdd holdings would be responsible for the first 125 million of the tax liabilities and any amount exceeding 125 million would then be allocated among seagate technology hdd holdings seagate technology san holdings certance holdings and seagate software cayman holdings corporation on a pro rata basis in accordance with the portion of the purchase price allocated to each entity in connection with the november 2000 transactions for indemnification obligations other than tax liabilities under the indemnification agreement the responsible entity would reimburse any entity that satisfied the obligation on its behalf 

  

on july 31 2001 seagate delaware and the internal revenue service filed a settlement stipulation with the united states tax court in complete settlement of the remaining disputed tax matter reflected in the statutory notice of deficiency dated june 12 1998 the settlement stipulation was expressly contingent upon seagate delaware and the internal revenue service entering into a closing agreement in connection with certain tax matters arising in all or some part of the open tax years of seagate delaware and new sac the internal revenue service completed its review of seagate delaware’s federal tax returns for the periods prior to the acquisition date of the operating assets and submitted its conclusions to the congressional joint committee on taxation for review on march 15 2004 veritas received written notification from the internal revenue service that the congressional joint committee on taxation had completed its review and had taken no exception to the internal revenue service’s conclusions

overview 

  

industry overview our industry is characterized by several trends that have a material impact on our strategic planning financial condition and results of operations 

  

first we believe that the industry is experiencing several positive trends relative to overall demand including 

  

   

   

   

   

we believe that for some of the fastest growing applications described above particularly in consumer electronics the demand is focused on higher capacity products 

  

historically the disc drive industry has exhibited a seasonal decline in unit demand during the first half of each calendar year given the dramatic rates of growth exhibited by the consumer electronics applications in the march 2005 and june 2005 quarters there was no traditional seasonal decline experienced by the disc drive industry in fiscal year 2005 this lack of seasonality is unprecedented in the disc drive industry and there can be no assurance that this will occur again given the highly seasonal nature of consumer electronics products generally the traditional seasonal decline in unit demand could be even greater in future years 

  

second our industry has been characterized by continuous and significant advances in technology which have contributed to rapid product life cycles the importance of being first to market with new products and the difficulty in recovering research and development expenses however we believe that our industry is currently in a period in which the rate of growth in areal density has slowed due to increased technological complexity the slowing rate of growth in areal density has contributed to 

  

   

   

   

currently the industry is in the midst of significant product transitions and new product introductions which we believe in some cases have significantly stimulated the growth of new markets disc drive unit shipments in fiscal year 2005 were approximately 24 higher than those in fiscal year 2004 we believe that this growth has begun to and will continue to place strain on industry capacity and availability of certain key components such as media and heads particularly in connection with the demand for higher capacity products the lead times and capital requirements necessary to build component capacity can be substantial this strain on industry and key component capacity may be reducing the potential for excess industry supply and accelerated price erosion and may be increasing the potential for market share shifts among industry competitors due to product availability this dynamic may also slow the rate of industry cost reductions 

  

finally to the extent that our industry builds product based on expectations of demand that do not materialize the distribution channel may experience an oversupply of products that could lead to increased price erosion the industry exited the june 2005 quarter with what we believe to be more than 5 weeks of distribution channel inventory 

  

seagate overview  we are a leader in the disc drive industry with products that address substantially all of the available consumer electronics mobile computing enterprise and desktop storage markets we maintain a 

  

highly integrated approach to our business by designing and manufacturing a significant portion of the components we view as critical to our products such as readwrite heads and recording media we believe that our control of these key technologies combined with our platform design and manufacturing enable us to achieve product performance timetomarket leadership and manufacturing flexibility which allows us to respond to customers and market opportunities our technology ownership combined with our integrated design and manufacturing have allowed us to effectively leverage our leadership in traditional computing markets into new highergrowth markets with only incremental product development and manufacturing costs 

  

revenue in fiscal year 2005 of 76 billion was driven primarily by customer acceptance of our new products introduced in june 2004 particularly in the consumer electronics market these new products contributed approximately 53 of revenue in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005 

  

   

   

   

   

over the past several quarters our dependency on the distribution channel has declined due to stabilization of supplydemand active distribution inventory management and increased oem demand we exited the june quarter with approximately 45 weeks of distribution channel inventory which we believe was at the lowend of the industry average for fiscal years 2005 and 2004 72 and 64 respectively of our disc drive revenue was from sales to oems for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005 the third quarter of fiscal year 2005 and the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004 76 70 and 74 respectively of our disc drive revenue was from sales to oems 

  

historically we have exhibited a seasonal decline in unit demand during the first half of each calendar year given the dramatic rates of growth exhibited by the consumer electronics applications in the march 2005 and 

  

june 2005 quarters we did not experience a traditional seasonal decline in fiscal year 2005 this lack of seasonality is unprecedented in the disc drive industry and there can be no assurance that this will occur again given the highly seasonal nature of consumer electronics products generally the traditional seasonal decline in unit demand could be even greater for us in future years 

  

in this period of rapid industry unit growth and strain on industry capacity and component availability we believe that our areal density and vertical design and manufacture of heads and media have contributed to the increased demand for our products and our ability to supply that demand as we have broadened our product portfolio and have gained acceptance in markets previously unaddressed by us demand for our products has outstripped existing production capacity and we have been constrained in our ability to fully meet our customers’ requirements as a result we are and we believe the industry is at full production capacity given substantial constraints in key components such as glass and aluminum media during the june 2005 quarter and will remain so for at least the september 2005 quarter in particular these component constraints will limit our ability to meet demand for certain of our mobile and desktop products in the september 2005 quarter we will continue to increase our capital investment and add capacity in a measured manner particularly in our key components capacity to ensure that we can meet existing customer requirements 

  

commencing in our first quarter of fiscal year 2006 we will include the effect of expensing stock options in our results of operations also in fiscal year 2006 we expect our income tax rate to increase

results of operations 

  

we list in the tables below the historical consolidated statements of operations in dollars and as a percentage of revenue for the fiscal years indicated 

  

   

   

fiscal year 2005 compared to fiscal year 2004 

  

revenue revenue for fiscal year 2005 was 7553 billion up 21 from 6224 billion in fiscal year 2004 the increase in revenue was primarily due to record disc drive shipments of 981 million units in fiscal year 2005 compared to 793 million units in fiscal year 2004 as well as an improved product mix of our new products offset by price erosion unit shipments for our products in fiscal year 2005 were as follows 

  

   

   

   

   

our overall average sales price per unit asp for our products was 72 76 79 and 80 for the first second third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2005 respectively this increase in overall asp reflects the favorable impact of the new products many of which have asp’s above the company average 

  

we continue to maintain various sales programs aimed at increasing customer demand we exercise judgment in formulating the underlying estimates related to distributor inventory levels sales program participation and customer claims submittals in determining the provision for such programs during fiscal year 2005 sales programs recorded as contra revenue were approximately 5 of our gross revenue compared to 7 of our gross revenue for fiscal year 2004 the decrease in sales programs as a percentage of gross revenue was the result of a shift in revenue mix from our distribution customers where the various sales programs are more prevalent to our oem customers and lower channel inventory levels with respect to our distribution customers 

  

cost of revenue cost of revenue for fiscal year 2005 was 5880 billion up 23 from 4765 billion in fiscal year 2004 gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2005 was 22 as compared with 23 for fiscal year 2004 the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue from fiscal year 2004 was primarily due to price erosion higher costs associated with new product transitions and increased warranty accruals with respect to new and older products partially offset by higher overall unit shipments and an increased mix of new highermargin products 

  

product development expense product development expense decreased by 21 million or 3 for fiscal year 2005 when compared with fiscal year 2004 the decrease in product development expense from fiscal year 2004 was primarily due to decreases of 26 million in salaries resulting from reductions in staffing levels 10 million in product development support costs 6 million resulting from the discontinuation of certain benefits associated with our postretirement medical plan 4 million in relocation costs and 4 million in depreciation these decreases were partially offset by an increase of 30 million in variable performancebased compensation 

  

marketing and administrative expense marketing and administrative expense increased by 16 million or 6 for fiscal year 2005 when compared with fiscal year 2004 the increase in marketing and administrative expense from fiscal year 2004 was primarily due to increases of 27 million in variable performancebased compensation and 4 million in the provision for bad debt these increases were partially offset by decreases of 13 million in salaries resulting from reductions in staffing levels and 3 million resulting from the discontinuation of certain benefits associated with our postretirement medical plan 

  

restructuring during fiscal year 2005 we recorded 8 million in restructuring charges these costs were primarily a result of a restructuring plan established to continue the alignment of our global workforce with existing and anticipated future business requirements primarily in our us operations the restructuring charges were comprised of employee termination costs of 5 million relating to a reduction in our workforce and approximately 3 million in charges related to impaired facilities improvements as a result of the alignment plan these restructuring activities were substantially complete at july 1 2005 additionally we reversed approximately 8 million of our restructuring accruals comprised of approximately 3 million recorded in prior fiscal years relating to accrued severance benefits that were less than amounts originally estimated and approximately 5 million relating to the sale in the first quarter of fiscal year 2005 of a surplus building previously impaired in the fiscal year 2000 restructuring 

  

upon completion of the fiscal year 2005 restructuring activities we estimate that annual salary expense will be reduced by approximately 8 million we continue to look at opportunities for further cost reductions which may result in additional restructuring activities and restructuring charges in the future 

  

net other income expense net other income of 10 million in fiscal year 2005 changed from net other expense of 16 million for fiscal year 2004 the change from fiscal year 2004 was primarily due to an increase in interest income of 18 million resulting from higher average interest rates and higher average balances in our interest bearing accounts and 10 million in income in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005 resulting from the settlement of a litigation matter 

  

income taxes we recorded a provision for income taxes of 25 million for the fiscal year ended july 1 2005 compared to a benefit from income taxes of 101 million for the fiscal year ended july 2 2004 we are a 

  

foreign holding company incorporated in the cayman islands with foreign and us subsidiaries that operate in multiple taxing jurisdictions as a result our worldwide operating income is either subject to varying rates of tax or is exempt from tax due to tax holidays or tax incentive programs we operate under in china malaysia singapore and thailand these tax holidays or incentives are scheduled to expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2015 our provision for income taxes recorded for the fiscal year ended july 1 2005 differs from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying a notional us 35 rate to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i the tax benefit related to the aforementioned tax holidays and tax incentive programs ii an increase in our valuation allowance for certain foreign deferred tax assets iii a tax benefit related to a reduction in previously accrued foreign income taxes and iv utilization of us research tax credits generated in the current year our provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended july 2 2004 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying a notional us 35 rate to income before income taxes primarily due to i the tax benefit related to the aforementioned tax holidays and tax incentive programs ii an additional valuation allowance recorded for us deferred tax assets and iii the reversal of the 125 million tax indemnification amount for veritas further described below based on our foreign ownership structure and subject to i potential future increases in our valuation allowance for us deferred tax assets and ii limitations imposed by internal revenue code section 382 on usage of certain tax attributes further described below we anticipate that our effective tax rate in future periods will generally be less than the us federal statutory rate dividend distributions received from our us subsidiaries may be subject to us withholding taxes when and if distributed deferred tax liabilities have not been recorded on unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as these earnings will not be subject to tax in the cayman islands or to us federal income taxes if remitted to our foreign parent holding company 

  

as of july 1 2005 we have recorded net deferred tax assets of 47 million the realization of which is primarily dependent on our ability to generate sufficient us and certain foreign taxable income in fiscal years 2006 and 2007 although realization is not assured we believe that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable however may increase or decrease in subsequent quarters when we reevaluate our estimates of future us and certain foreign taxable income 

  

on january 3 2005 we underwent a change in ownership within the meaning of section 382 of the internal revenue code irc sec 382 due to the sale of additional common shares to the public by our largest shareholder new sac as a result our prechange net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation based upon i the aggregate fair market value of our us business operations immediately before the ownership change multiplied by ii the federal longterm tax exempt rate within the meaning of irc sec 382f in effect at that time based upon an independent valuation as of january 3 2005 the annual limitation is 448 million this annual limitation is cumulative therefore if not fully utilized in a year it is carried forward for utilization in future years in addition to the irc sec 382 limitation for those years to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets consisting of the prechange net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards will not be realized a valuation allowance has been provided the impact of the irc sec 382 limitation was to increase our current tax expense related to the tax benefit of stock options credited to shareholders equity by approximately 15 million during the current fiscal year in future years such limitation may cause certain prechange net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards to expire before utilization as of july 1 2005 409 million of us net operating loss carryforwards and 123 million of us tax credit carryforwards were subject to the sec 382 limitation in fiscal year 2006 as a result of this change in control we expect our income tax rate to increase 

  

the internal revenue service is currently examining our federal income tax returns for fiscal years ending in 2001 and 2002 the timing of the settlement of these examinations is uncertain we believe that adequate amounts of tax have been provided for any final assessments that may result 

  

in the fiscal year ended july 2 2004 we recorded a 125 million income tax benefit from the reversal of 125 million of accrued income taxes relating to tax indemnification amounts due to veritas 

  

pursuant to the indemnification agreement between seagate delaware suez acquisition corporation and veritas the tax indemnification amount was recorded by us in connection with the purchase of the operating assets of seagate delaware and represented us tax liabilities previously accrued by seagate delaware for periods prior to the acquisition date of the operating assets as a result of the conclusion of the tax audits with no additional tax liabilities due management determined that the 125 million accrual for the tax indemnification was no longer required and it was reversed in our third quarter of fiscal year 2004 

  

fiscal year 2004 compared to fiscal year 2003 

  

revenue revenue for fiscal year 2004 was 6224 billion down 4 from 6486 billion in fiscal year 2003 the decrease in revenue was primarily due to price erosion particularly with respect to our enterprise storage products partially offset by an increase in unit shipments our unit shipments increased from 68 million units in fiscal year 2003 to 79 million units in fiscal year 2004 this increase in unit shipments was primarily in our desktop storage products and was due to an increase in the total available market additionally shipments increased as a result of the introduction of our mobile computing storage product 

  

our overall average unit sales price for our disc drive products was 81 80 76 and 71 for the first second third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2004 respectively price erosion from fiscal year 2003 to fiscal year 2004 was approximately 18 

  

unit shipments for desktop storage disc drives were 590 million for fiscal year 2004 up from 523 million in fiscal year 2003 however we did experience a slight decline in drive shipments for desktop applications in the fourth fiscal quarter which can be attributed to an unexpected decline in industry distribution channel sellthrough despite this decline we believe that we maintained our market share 

  

unit shipments for enterprise storage disc drives were 104 million during fiscal year 2004 slightly down from 105 million in fiscal year 2003 and although we experienced aggressive pricing we believe we maintained our market share 

  

during fiscal year 2004 we shipped 36 million mobile computing disc drives we were impacted by our limited product set for this market and our concentrated customer base we also experienced aggressive pricing in the first half of calendar year 2004 

  

unit shipments for consumer electronics storage disc drives were 63 million during fiscal year 2004 which represents a 33 increase in shipments from fiscal year 2003 this reflects strong growth in shipments to digital video recorder consumer electronics applications 

  

we continued to maintain various sales programs aimed at increasing customer demand we exercise judgment in formulating the underlying estimates related to distributor inventory levels sales program participation and customer claims submittals in determining the provision for such programs during fiscal year 2004 sales programs issued and recorded as contrarevenue were approximately 7 of our gross revenue compared to 5 of our gross revenue for fiscal year 2003 the increase in the provision for sales programs as a percentage of our gross revenue in fiscal year 2004 as compared to fiscal year 2003 was the result of higher distribution unit sales particularly in the first half of fiscal year 2004 

  

cost of revenue cost of revenue for fiscal year 2004 was 4765 billion and was flat from 4759 billion in fiscal year 2003 gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2004 was 23 as compared with 27 for fiscal year 2003 the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to price erosion as a result of fewer new product introductions and longer product cycles caused by a slowing in the rate of increase in areal density gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the first second third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2004 was 27 26 22 and 17 respectively 

  

product development expense product development expense decreased by 4 million or 1 for fiscal year 2004 when compared with fiscal year 2003 the decrease in product development expense from fiscal year 

  

2003 was primarily due to decreases of 30 million in employee incentive compensation a 6 million business development grant received in fiscal year 2003 4 million in legal expense and the absence of 4 million in product development expense incurred in the yearago period by xiotech which we sold in fiscal year 2003 these decreases were partially offset by increases of 21 million in salaries as a result of increased headcount and annual merit increases 11 million in program materials and 7 million in depreciation 

  

marketing and administrative expense marketing and administrative expense decreased by 67 million or 19 for fiscal year 2004 when compared with fiscal year 2003 the decrease in marketing and administrative expense from fiscal year 2003 was primarily due to the absence of 16 million in marketing and administrative expense incurred by xiotech which we sold in fiscal year 2003 and decreases of 12 million related to the discontinuation of an annual monitoring fee paid to certain new sac investors 7 million in compensation expense pursuant to executive terminations all of which occurred in fiscal year 2003 as well as 18 million in employee incentive compensation and 12 million in outside services 

  

restructuring during fiscal year 2004 we recorded 59 million in restructuring charges of the 59 million 39 million was incurred in our fourth fiscal quarter ended july 2 2004 and was associated with the planned workforce reduction that we first announced in april 2004 and implemented in june 2004 the 39 million restructuring charge was comprised of employee termination costs relating to a workforce reduction primarily in our us and far east operations of approximately 2400 employees the restructuring activities related to the charge taken in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004 were substantially complete as of october 2004 

  

the remaining 20 million in restructuring charges were incurred through the nine months ended april 2 2004 as a result of a restructuring plan established to continue the alignment of our global workforce with existing and anticipated future market requirements primarily in our us design centers and far east operations the restructuring costs were comprised of employee termination costs relating to a reduction in our workforce of approximately 650 employees these restructuring activities were substantially complete at july 2 2004 upon completion of the fiscal year 2004 restructuring activities we estimate that annual salary expense was reduced by approximately 95 million 

  

net other income expense net other expense decreased 15 million or 48 for fiscal year 2004 when compared with fiscal year 2003 the decrease in net other expense from fiscal year 2003 was primarily due to a decrease of 8 million in writedowns of our investment in a private company and a 4 million change in the value of the underlying assets of the rabbi trust associated with the deferred compensation plan 

  

income taxes we recorded a benefit from income taxes of 101 million for the fiscal year ended july 2 2004 compared to a provision for income taxes of 19 million for the fiscal year ended june 27 2003 we are a foreign holding company incorporated in the cayman islands with foreign and us subsidiaries that operate in multiple taxing jurisdictions as a result our worldwide operating income is either subject to varying rates of tax or is exempt from tax due to tax holidays or tax incentive programs we operate under in china malaysia singapore and thailand these tax holidays or incentives are scheduled to expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2015 the benefit for income taxes recorded for the fiscal year ended july 2 2004 differs from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying a notional us 35 rate to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i the tax benefit related to the aforementioned tax holidays and tax incentive programs ii an additional valuation allowance recorded for us deferred tax assets and iii the reversal of the 125 million tax indemnification amount for veritas further described below our provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended june 27 2003 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying a notional us 35 rate to income before income taxes primarily due to i the tax benefit related to the aforementioned tax holidays and tax incentive programs and ii the realization of deferred tax assets that had previously been subject to a valuation allowance based on our foreign ownership structure and subject to potential future increases in our valuation allowance for us deferred tax assets we anticipate that our effective tax rate in future periods will generally be less than the us federal statutory rate dividends received from our us subsidiaries may be subject to us withholding taxes when and if distributed deferred 

  

tax liabilities have not been recorded on unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as these earnings will not be subject to tax in the cayman islands or to us federal income taxes if remitted to our foreign parent holding company

liquidity and capital resources 

  

the following is a discussion of our principal liquidity requirements and capital resources 

  

as of july 1 2005 our indebtedness consisted of 400 million in principal amount of 8 senior notes due 2009 and senior secured credit facilities which consisted of a 350 million term loan facility that had been drawn in full and a 150 million revolving credit facility under which 35 million had been utilized for outstanding letters of credit the credit agreement that governs our senior secured credit facilities contains covenants that seagate technology hdd holdings or hdd our whollyowned subsidiary that operates our disc drive business must satisfy in order to remain in compliance with the agreement these covenants require hdd among other things to maintain the following ratios 1 an interest expense coverage ratio for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters of at least 250100 2 a fixed charge coverage ratio for any four consecutive fiscal quarters of at least 150100 and 3 a net leverage ratio of not more than 150100 as of the end of any fiscal quarter as of july 1 2005 we are in compliance with all of these covenants including the financial ratios that we are required to maintain 

  

the calculated financial ratios for the quarter ended july 1 2005 are as follows 

  

   

on july 28 2005 our board of directors approved a resolution which authorized management to either restructure or repay the 350 million term loan and the 150 million revolving credit facility such restructuring 

  

or repayment may result in increased flexibility with respect to payment of dividends andor the ability to repurchase some of our common shares 

  

the degree to which we are leveraged could materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for working capital capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances or other purposes and could make us more vulnerable to industry downturns and competitive pressures although we are currently not a party to any agreement or letter of intent with respect to potential investments in or acquisitions of complementary businesses products or technologies we may enter into these types of arrangements in the future which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all we will require substantial amounts of cash to fund scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness future capital expenditures and any increased working capital requirements if we are unable to meet our cash requirements out of existing cash or cash flow from operations we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain alternative financing on terms acceptable to us if at all

during fiscal year 2005 we paid dividends aggregating approximately 122 million or 026 per share to our common shareholders of record as of august 6 2004 november 5 2004 february 4 2005 and may 6 2005 on july 19 2005 we declared a quarterly dividend of 008 per share to be paid on or before august 19 2005 to our common shareholders of record as of august 5 2005 

  

our principal sources of liquidity as of july 1 2005 consisted of 1 1836 billion in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments 2 a 150 million revolving credit facility of which 35 million had been used for outstanding letters of credit and bankers’ guarantees as of july 1 2005 and 3 cash we expect to generate from operations 

  

our principal liquidity requirements are to service our debt and meet our working capital research and development and capital expenditure needs in addition since the second half of fiscal year 2002 and through fiscal years 2003 2004 and 2005 we have paid dividends to our shareholders 

  

we believe that our sources of cash will be sufficient to fund our operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months our ability to fund these requirements and comply with the financial covenants under our debt agreements will depend on our future operations performance and cash flow and is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial business and other factors some of which are beyond our control in addition as part of our strategy we may selectively pursue strategic alliances acquisitions and investments that are complementary to our business any material future acquisitions alliances or investments will likely require additional capital we cannot assure you that additional funds from available sources will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 

  

our contractual cash obligations and commitments as of july 1 2005 have been summarized in the table below in millions 

  

    

   

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

as of july 1 2005 we did not have any material offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of regulation sk 

  

equity compensation plan information 

  

the following table sets forth for each of our existing equity compensation plans the number of common shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding options warrants and rights the weightedaverage exercise price of the outstanding options warrants and rights and the number of common shares remaining available for issuance under such plans as of the end of fiscal year 2005 

  

    

   

   

critical accounting policies 

  

the methods estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements the sec has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are highly uncertain at the time of estimation based on this definition our most critical policies include establishment of sales program accruals establishment of warranty accruals and valuation of deferred tax assets below we discuss these policies further as well as the estimates and judgments involved we also have other key accounting policies and accounting estimates relating to uncollectible customer accounts and valuation of inventory we believe that these other accounting policies and accounting estimates either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective or it is less likely that they would have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period 

  

establishment of sales program accruals we establish certain distributor and oem sales programs aimed at increasing customer demand these programs are typically related to a distributor’s level of sales order size advertising or point of sale activity or an oem’s level of sale activity or agreed upon rebate programs we provide for these obligations at the time that revenue is recorded based on estimated requirements these estimates are based on various factors including estimated future price erosion customer orders and sellthrough levels program participation customer claim submittals and sales returns during periods in which our distributors’ inventories of our products are at higher than historical levels such as the second quarter of fiscal year 2004 our estimates upon which our recorded contrarevenue is based are subject to a greater degree of 

  

subjectivity and the potential for actual results to vary is accordingly higher currently our distributors’ inventories of our products are at the low end of the historical range significant actual variations in any of the factors upon which we base our estimates could have a material effect on our operating results in addition our failure to accurately predict the level of future sales returns by our distribution customers could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

establishment of warranty accruals we estimate probable product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized we generally warrant our products for a period of one to five years we use estimated repair or replacement costs and use statistical modeling to estimate product return rates in order to determine our warranty obligation we exercise judgment in determining the underlying estimates our judgment is subject to a greater degree of subjectivity with respect to newly introduced products because of a lack of past experience with those products upon which to base our estimates we recently introduced a number of new products of which we are in the early stages of volume shipment in addition effective june 1 2004 we extended our standard warranty from one year to five years on all internal desktop and notebook disc drives shipped through the distribution and retail channels if the actual rate of unit failures is greater than what we used in estimating the warranty expense accrual we would need to increase our warranty accrual and our results of operations could be materially affected 

  

valuation of deferred tax assets the recording of our deferred tax assets each period depends primarily on our ability to generate current and future taxable income in the united states each period we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and we adjust the valuation allowance so that we record net deferred tax assets only to the extent that we conclude it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

in november 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 151 “inventory costs” “sfas 151” sfas 151 amends accounting research bulletin no 43 chapter 4 “inventory pricing” this statement clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and wasted material and requires those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of “so abnormal” additionally sfas 151 requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities beginning with our first quarter of fiscal year 2006 we will be required to adopt sfas 151 we do not expect that the adoption of sfas 151 will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 

  

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” “sfas 123r” which is a revision of sfas 123 “accounting for stock compensation” “sfas 123” and supersedes accounting principles board opinion “apbo” no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” “apbo 25” and its related implementation guidance sfas 123r clarifies and expands sfas 123’s guidance in several areas including measuring fair value classifying an award as equity or as a liability and attributing compensation cost to reporting periods additionally sfas 123r amends fasb statement no 95 “statement of cash flows” to require that excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as reduction of taxes paid beginning with our first quarter of fiscal year 2006 we will be required to adopt sfas 123r and will recognize sharebased compensation costs in our results of operations we currently provide pro forma disclosures under sfas 123 reflecting the effects of sharebased compensation costs on our results of operations in our notes to consolidated financial statements see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies—pro forma effects of stockbased compensation on net income per share although such pro forma effects of applying sfas 123 may be indicative of the effects of adopting sfas 123r the provisions of these two statements differ in some important respects the actual effects of adopting sfas 123r will be dependent on numerous factors including but not limited to levels of sharebased payments granted in the future and the timing thereof the valuation model chosen by us to value stockbased awards the assumed award forfeiture rate the accounting policies adopted concerning the method of recognizing the fair value of awards over the service period the potentially significant effect of income taxes and the transition method chosen for adopting sfas 123r which permits 

  

public companies to adopt its requirements using various methods including the “modified prospective application method” and the “modified retrospective application method” we plan to adopt sfas 123r using the modified prospective application method we expect that the adoption of sfas 123r will have a material impact on our results of operations subsequent to adoption 

  

in june 2005 the fasb issued sfas no 154 “accounting changes and error corrections” “sfas 154” sfas 154 replaces apbo no 20 “apbo 20” and sfas no 3 “reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements” and applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and changes the requirements for accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle apbo 20 previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of change a cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle whereas sfas 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods’ financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is impracticable sfas 154 enhances the consistency of financial information between periods sfas 154 will be effective beginning with our first quarter of fiscal year 2006 we not expect that the adoption of sfas 154 will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 

  

risk factors 

  

risks related to our business 

  

competition—our industry is highly competitive and our products have experienced significant price erosion and market share variability 

  

even during periods when demand is stable the disc drive industry is intensely competitive and vendors typically experience substantial price erosion over the life of a product our competitors have historically offered existing products at lower prices as part of a strategy to gain or retain market share and customers and we expect these practices to continue we may need to reduce our prices to retain our market share which could adversely affect our results of operations based on our recent experience in the industry with respect to new product introductions we believe that the rate of growth in areal density or the storage capacity per square inch on a disc is slowing from its previous levels this trend may contribute to increased average price erosion to the extent that historical price erosion patterns continue product life cycles may lengthen our competitors may have more time to enter the market for a particular product and we may be unable to offset these factors with new product introductions at higher average prices a second trend that may contribute to increased average price erosion is the growth of sales to distributors that serve producers of nonbranded products in the personal storage sector these customers generally have limited product qualification programs which increase the number of competing products available to satisfy their demand as a result purchasing decisions for these customers are based largely on price and terms any increase in our average price erosion would have an adverse effect on our result of operations 

  

moreover a significant portion of our success in the past has been a result of increasing our market share at the expense of our competitors our market share for our products can be negatively affected by our customers’ diversifying their sources of supply as the slowing rate of growth in areal density has resulted in longer product cycles and more time for our competitors to enter the market for particular products when our competitors successfully introduce product offerings which are competitive with our recently introduced new products our customers may quickly diversify their sources of supply any significant decline in our market share would adversely affect our results of operations 

  

principal competitors—we compete with both independent manufacturers whose primary focus is producing technologically advanced disc drives and captive manufacturers who do not depend solely on sales of disc drives to maintain their profitability 

  

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience intense competition from a number of domestic and foreign companies including other independent disc drive manufacturers and large captive manufacturers such as 

  

   

the term “independent” in this context refers to manufacturers that primarily produce disc drives as a standalone product and the term “captive” refers to disc drive manufacturers who themselves or through affiliated entities produce complete computer or other systems that contain disc drives or other information storage products captive manufacturers are formidable competitors because they have the ability to determine pricing for complete systems without regard to the margins on individual components because components other than disc drives generally contribute a greater portion of the operating margin on a complete computer system than do disc drives captive manufacturers do not necessarily need to realize a profit on the disc drives included in a computer system and as a result may be willing to sell disc drives to third parties at very low margins many captive manufacturers are also formidable competitors because they have more substantial resources than we do in addition hitachi global storage technologies together with affiliated entities and samsung electronics incorporated also sell other products to our customers including critical components like flash memory 

  

applicationspecific integrated circuits or asics and flat panel displays and may be willing to sell their disc drives at a lower margin to advance their overall business strategy this may improve their ability to compete with us to the extent we are not successful competing with captive or independent disc drive manufacturers our results of operations will be adversely affected 

  

in addition in response to customer demand for highquality highvolume and lowcost disc drives manufacturers of disc drives have had to develop large in some cases global production facilities with highly developed technological capabilities and internal controls the development of large production facilities and industry consolidation can contribute to the intensification of competition we also face indirect competition from present and potential customers who evaluate from time to time whether to manufacture their own disc drives or other information storage products 

  

we have also started to experience competition from other companies that produce alternative storage technologies like flash memory where increased capacity and lower cost of these technologies have resulted in competition with our lower capacity smaller form factor disc drives 

  

volatility of quarterly results—our quarterly operating results fluctuate significantly from period to period and this may cause our stock price to decline 

  

in the past our quarterly revenue and operating results fluctuated significantly from period to period we expect this fluctuation to continue for a variety of reasons including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

as a result we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful and that these comparisons may not be an accurate indicator of our future performance our operating results in one or more future quarters may fail to meet the expectations of investment research analysts or investors which could cause an immediate and significant decline in the trading price of our common shares 

  

new product offerings—market acceptance of new product introductions cannot be accurately predicted and our results of operations will suffer if there is less demand for our new products than is anticipated 

  

we are continually developing new products in the hope that we will be able to introduce technologically advanced disc drives into the marketplace ahead of our competitors 

  

the success of our new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors including market acceptance our ability to manage the risks associated with product transitions the effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand and the risk that our new products will have quality problems or other defects in the early stages of introduction that were not anticipated in the design of those products accordingly we cannot accurately determine the ultimate effect that our new products will have on our results of operations 

  

in addition the success of our new product introductions is dependent upon our ability to qualify as a primary source of supply with our oem customers in order for our products to be considered by our customers for qualification we must be among the leaders in timetomarket with those new products once a product is accepted for qualification testing any failure or delay in the qualification process or a requirement that we requalify can result in our losing sales to that customer until new products are introduced the limited number of highvolume oems magnifies the effect of missing a product qualification opportunity these risks are further magnified because we expect competitive pressures to result in declining sales and declining gross margins on our current generation products we cannot assure you that we will be among the leaders in timetomarket with new products or that we will be able to successfully qualify new products with our customers in the future 

  

smaller form factor disc drives—if we do not continue to successfully market smaller form factor disc drives our business may suffer 

  

the disc drive industry is experiencing significant increases in sales of smaller form factor disc drives for an expanding number of applications in particular notebook computers and consumer electronics devices but also including personal computers and enterprise storage applications many of these applications have typically used disc drives with a 35inch form factor which we currently manufacture some of these applications such as consumer electronics applications like digital music players and digital cameras represent fast growing markets for disc drives we initiated volume shipments of our first small form factor disc drive the momentus notebook disc drive to a number of oems in the second quarter of fiscal year 2004 in june 2004 we announced our first 1inch form factor disc drive additional capacity models of our momentus notebook disc drive and a 25inch form factor disc drive for enterprise storage applications in june 2005 we announced an 8gb 1inch form factor disc drive which will primarily be used in handheld consumer electronics devices such as digital music players and digital cameras and new versions of our 25inch disc drives for the mobile computing and consumer electronics markets if we do not successfully introduce these products or if we do not suitably adapt our technology and product offerings to successfully develop and introduce additional smaller form factor disc drives customers may decrease the amounts of our products that they purchase which would adversely affect our results of operations 

  

seasonality—because we experience seasonality in the sales of our products our results of operations will generally be adversely impacted during our fourth fiscal quarter 

  

because sales of computer systems storage subsystems and consumer electronics tend to be seasonal we expect to continue to experience seasonality in our business as we respond to variations in our customers’ demand for disc drives in particular we anticipate that sales of our products will continue to be lower during our fourth fiscal quarter than the rest of the year in the desktop computer notebook computer and consumer electronics sectors of our business this seasonality is partially attributable to our customers’ increased sales of personal computers and consumer electronics during the winter holiday season in the enterprise sector of our business our sales are seasonal because of the capital budgeting and purchasing cycles of our end users because our working capital needs peak during periods in which we are increasing production in anticipation of orders that have not yet been received our operating results will fluctuate seasonally even if the forecasted demand for our products proves accurate furthermore it is difficult for us to evaluate the degree to which this seasonality may affect our business in future periods because our overall growth may have reduced the impact of this seasonality in recent periods for instance given the dramatic rates of growth exhibited by the consumer electronics applications in the march 2005 and june 2005 quarters we did not experience a traditional seasonal decline in fiscal year 2005 this lack of seasonality is unprecedented in the disc drive industry and there can be 

  

no assurance that this will occur again given the highly seasonal nature of consumer electronics products generally the traditional seasonal decline in unit demand could be even greater for us in future years 

  

difficulty in predicting quarterly demand—if we fail to predict demand accurately for our products in any quarter we may not be able to recapture the cost of our investments 

  

the disc drive industry operates on quarterly purchasing cycles with much of the order flow in any given quarter coming at the end of that quarter our manufacturing process requires us to make significant productspecific investments in inventory in each quarter for that quarter’s production because we typically receive the bulk of our orders late in a quarter after we have made our investments there is a risk that our orders will not be sufficient to allow us to recapture the costs of our investment before the products resulting from that investment have become obsolete we cannot assure you that we will be able to accurately predict demand in the future 

  

other factors that may negatively impact our ability to recapture the cost of investments in any given quarter include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

dependence on supply of equipment and components—if we experience shortages or delays in the receipt of critical equipment or components necessary to manufacture our products we may suffer lower operating margins production delays and other material adverse effects 

  

the cost quality and availability of components certain equipment and raw materials used to manufacture disc drives and key components like media and heads are critical to our success the equipment we use to manufacture our products and components is frequently custom made and comes from a few suppliers and the lead times required to obtain manufacturing equipment can be significant particularly important components for disc drives include readwrite heads recording media asics spindle motors printed circuit boards and suspension assemblies we rely on sole suppliers or a limited number of suppliers for some of these components including recording media that we do not manufacture asics spindle motors printed circuit boards and suspension assemblies in the past we have experienced increased costs and production delays when we were 

  

unable to obtain the necessary equipment or sufficient quantities of some components andor have been forced to pay higher prices or make volume purchase commitments or advance deposits for some components equipment or raw materials such as precious metals that were in short supply in the industry in general 

  

in addition the recent increases in demand for small form factor mobile products such as our st1 and momentus drives have led to shortages in the components used in smaller form factor disc drives such as the glass substrates used to make the recording media for such drives increasing unit growth for 35inch disc drives could also put a strain on aluminum media production capacity 

  

historically the technology sector specifically and the economy generally have experienced economic pressure which has resulted in consolidation among component manufacturers and may result in some component manufacturers exiting the industry or not making sufficient investments in research to develop new components 

  

if there is a shortage of or delay in supplying us with critical components equipment or raw materials then 

  

   

   

   

   

we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain critical components in a timely and economic manner or at all 

  

importance of reducing operating costs—if we do not reduce our operating expenses we will not be able to compete effectively in our industry 

  

our strategy involves to a substantial degree increasing revenue and product volume while at the same time reducing operating expenses in this regard we have engaged in ongoing companywide manufacturing efficiency activities intended to increase productivity and reduce costs these activities have included closures and transfers of facilities significant personnel reductions and efforts to increase automation for example in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004 we undertook significant restructuring activities to reduce the costs of our operations and we continue to look at opportunities for further cost reductions which may result in additional restructuring activities in the future we cannot assure you that our efforts will result in the increased profitability cost savings or other benefits that we expect moreover the reduction of personnel and closure of facilities may adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in required volumes to meet customer demand and may result in other disruptions that affect our products and customer service in addition the transfer of manufacturing capacity of a product to a different facility frequently requires qualification of the new facility by some of our oem customers we cannot assure you that these activities and transfers will be implemented on a costeffective basis without delays or disruption in our production and without adversely affecting our customer relationships and results of operations 

  

industry demand—changes in demand for computer systems and storage subsystems has caused and may cause in the future a decline in demand for our products 

  

our disc drives are components in computers computer systems storage subsystems and consumer electronics devices the demand for these products has been volatile in a weak economy consumer spending 

  

tends to decline and retail demand for personal computers and consumer electronics devices tends to decrease as does enterprise demand for computer systems and storage subsystems during economic slowdowns such as the one that began in 2000 demand for disc drives particularly in the enterprise sector was adversely impacted as a result of the weakened economy and because enterprises shifted their focus from making new equipment purchases to more efficiently using their existing information technology infrastructure through among other things adopting new storage architectures unexpected slowdowns in demand for computer systems and storage subsystems generally cause sharp declines in demand for disc drive products 

  

additional causes of declines in demand for our products in the past have included announcements or introductions of major operating system or semiconductor improvements or changes in consumer preferences such as the shift from desktop to notebook computers we believe these announcements and introductions have from time to time caused consumers to defer their purchases and made inventory obsolete whenever an oversupply of disc drives causes participants in our industry to have higher than anticipated inventory levels we experience even more intense price competition from other disc drive manufacturers than usual 

  

dependence on distributors—we are dependent on sales to distributors which may increase price erosion and the volatility of our sales 

  

a substantial portion of our sales has been to distributors of desktop disc drive products product qualification programs in this distribution channel are limited which increases the number of competing products that are available to satisfy demand particularly in times of lengthening product cycles as a result purchasing decisions in this channel are based largely on price terms and product availability sales volumes through this channel are also less predictable and subject to greater volatility than sales to our oem customers in the second half of fiscal year 2004 a number of disc drive manufacturers independently launched initiatives to improve the stability of the distribution channel particularly with respect to the purchasing behavior of these distributors while other disc drive manufacturers have not these actions have further increased the uncertainty as to demand within this market segment to the extent that distributors reduce their purchases of our products or prices decline significantly in the distribution channel our results of operations would be adversely affected 

  

longer product life cycles—lengthening of product life cycles can make planning product transitions difficult and may reduce the favorable impact of new product transitions 

  

in contrast to historical trends based on our recent experience in the industry with respect to new product introductions we believe that the current rate of growth in areal density is slowing from the rate of the last several years we believe that this slowdown in the rate of growth in areal density will continue until a significant advance in technology for the electronic storage of data such as perpendicular recording technology becomes commercially available 

  

when the rate of growth in areal density slows it may contribute to increased average price erosion to the extent historical price erosion patterns continue a limitation in our ability to introduce new products at higher prices and lengthened product life cycles which permits competitors more time to enter the market for a particular type of disc drive in addition the lengthening of product life cycles can make planning product transitions more difficult to the extent that we prematurely discontinue a product or do not timely introduce new products our operating results may be adversely affected 

  

because the rate of growth in areal density is slowing the favorable impact of new product introductions on our results of operations may be minimized historically the introduction of new products generally has had a favorable impact on our results of operations both because the new products are introduced at higher prices than existing competitive offerings and because advances in areal density technology have enabled lower manufacturing costs through a reduction in components such as readwrite heads and discs however in contrast to when the rate of growth in areal density is increasing a slowing rate of growth in areal density can limit the cost benefits of new products because it is technologically more difficult to reduce the number of readwrite heads and discs in a particular drive in addition given the environment of intense price competition in the absence of significant capacity or reliability increases it is difficult to obtain higher prices for new products 

  

industry consolidation—consolidation among captive manufacturers may serve to increase their resources and improve their access to customers thereby making them more formidable competitors 

  

consolidation among captive manufacturers may provide them with competitive advantages over independent manufacturers including us for example in december 2002 ibm merged its disc drive business with the disc drive business of hitachi through the formation of hitachi global storage technologies a separate company hitachi is the controlling shareholder of hitachi global storage technologies and is expected to assume full ownership at the end of 2005 as a part of this transaction each of ibm and hitachi agreed to multiyear supply commitments with the new company because ibm is one of our most significant customers and hitachi is one of our most significant competitors there is a significant risk that ibm will decrease the number of disc drives purchased from us and increase the number purchased from the new company moreover economies of scale and the combination of the two companies’ technological capabilities particularly in the enterprise sector of our industry could make the new company a more formidable competitor than ibm or hitachi operating alone 

  

importance of timetomarket—our operating results may depend on our being among the firsttomarket and achieving sufficient production volume with our new products 

  

to achieve consistent success with our oem customers it is important that we be an early provider of new types of disc drives featuring leading highquality technology historically our operating results have substantially depended upon our ability to be among the firsttomarket with new product offerings however during a period of slowing areal density growth such as we are in now the importance of timetomarket may be less critical our market share and operating results in the future may be adversely affected particularly if the rate of growth in areal density resumes its historical pattern if we fail to 

  

   

   

   

   

if delivery of our products is delayed our oem customers may use our competitors’ products to meet their production requirements if the delay of our products causes delivery of those oems’ computer systems into which our products are integrated to be delayed consumers and businesses may purchase comparable products from the oems’ competitors 

  

moreover we face the related risk that consumers and businesses may wait to make their purchases if they want to buy a new product that has been shipped or announced but not yet released if this were to occur we may be unable to sell our existing inventory of products that may have become less efficient and cost effective compared to new products as a result even if we are among the firsttomarket with a given product subsequent introductions or announcements by our competitors of new products could cause us to lose revenue and not achieve a positive return on our investment in existing products and inventory 

  

dependence on key customers—we may be adversely affected by the loss of or reduced delayed or cancelled purchases by one or more of our larger customers 

  

some of our key customers including hewlettpackard dell ibm emc and apple account for a large portion of our disc drive revenue we have longstanding relationships with many of our customers however if any of our key customers were to significantly reduce their purchases from us our results of operations would be adversely affected while sales to major customers may vary from period to period a major customer that permanently discontinues or significantly reduces its relationship with us could be difficult to replace in line with industry practice new customers usually require that we pass a lengthy and rigorous qualification process at 

  

the customer’s cost accordingly it may be difficult for us to attract new major customers additionally mergers acquisitions consolidations or other significant transactions involving our customers generally entail risks to our business if a significant transaction involving any of our key customers results in the loss of or reduction in purchases by these key customers it could have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and prospects 

  

dependence on growth in consumer electronics products—our recent results have been materially benefited by significant growth in new consumer electronics products which can experience significant volatility due to seasonal and other factors which could materially adversely impact our future results of operations 

  

our recent results have been materially benefited by significant growth in new consumer electronics applications like digital video recorders and digital music players which are experiencing unexpected growth after the typically high demand holiday season while this growth has enabled us to offset the traditional seasonal decline experienced in the march and june quarters of fiscal year 2005 the demand for consumer electronics products can be even more volatile and unpredictable than the demand for the compute products which have been our traditional markets this potential for unpredictable volatility is increased by the possibility of competing alternative storage technologies like flash memory meeting the customers’ cost and capacity metrics resulting in a rapid shift in demand from our products and disc drive technology generally to alternative storage technologies unpredictable fluctuations in demand for our products or rapid shifts in demand from our products to alternative storage technologies in new consumer electronics applications could materially adversely impact our future results of operations 

  

new product development and technological change—if we do not develop products in time to keep pace with technological changes our operating results will be adversely affected 

  

our customers have demanded new generations of disc drive products as advances in computer hardware and software have created the need for improved storage products with features such as increased storage capacity improved performance and reliability of smaller form factors we and our competitors have developed improved products and we will need to continue to do so in the future for fiscal years 2005 2004 and 2003 we had product development expenses of 645 million 666 million and 670 million respectively we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully complete the design or introduction of new products in a timely manner that we will be able to manufacture new products in sufficient volumes with acceptable manufacturing yields that we will be able to successfully market these new products or that these products will perform to specifications on a longterm basis in addition the impact of slowing areal density growth may adversely impact our ability to be successful 

  

when we develop new products with higher capacity and more advanced technology our operating results may decline because the increased difficulty and complexity associated with producing these products increases the likelihood of reliability quality or operability problems if our products suffer increases in failures are of low quality or are not reliable customers may reduce their purchases of our products and our manufacturing rework and scrap costs and service and warranty costs may increase in addition a decline in the reliability of our products may make us less competitive as compared with other disc drive manufacturers 

  

impact of technological change—increases in the areal density of disc drives may outpace customers’ demand for storage capacity 

  

the rate of increase in areal density or storage capacity per square inch on a disc may be greater than the increase in our customers’ demand for aggregate storage capacity as a result our customers’ storage capacity needs may be satisfied with fewer disc drives these factors could decrease our sales especially when combined with continued price erosion which could adversely affect our results of operations 

  

changes in information storage products—future changes in the nature of information storage products may reduce demand for traditional disc drive products 

  

we expect that in the future new personal computing devices and products will be developed some of which such as internet appliances may not contain a disc drive while we are investing development resources in designing information storage products for new applications it is too early to assess the impact of these new applications on future demand for disc drive products we cannot assure you that we will be successful in developing other information storage products in addition there are currently no widely accepted standards in various technical areas that may be important to the future of our business including the developing sector of intelligent storage solutions products using alternative technologies such as semiconductor memory optical storage and other storage technologies could become a significant source of competition to particular applications of our products 

  

for example semiconductor memory is much faster than disc drives but currently is volatile in that it is subject to loss of data in the event of power failure and is much more costly than disc drive technologies flash eeprom a nonvolatile semiconductor memory is currently much more costly than disc drive technologies and while it has higher read performance than disc drives it has lower write performance flash eeprom could become competitive in the near future for applications requiring less storage capacity than that required in traditional markets for our products 

  

high fixed costs—our vertical integration strategy entails a high level of fixed costs 

  

our vertical integration strategy entails a high level of fixed costs and requires a high volume of production and sales to be successful during periods of decreased production these high fixed costs have had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition for example in 1998 our predecessor experienced a significant decrease in the demand for its products and because our predecessor was unable to adequately reduce its costs to offset this decrease in revenue its gross and operating margins suffered in addition a strategy of vertical integration has in the past and could in the future delay our ability to introduce products containing marketleading technology because we may not have developed the technology and source of components for our products and do not have access to external sources of supply without incurring substantial costs 

  

research and development expenses represent a significant portion of our fixed costs as part of our vertical integration strategy we explore a broad range of ways to improve disc drives as well as possible alternatives to disc drives for storing and retrieving electronic data if we fail to develop new technologies in a timely manner and our competitors succeed in doing so our ability to sell our products could be significantly diminished conversely if we over invest in technologies that can never be profitably manufactured and marketed our results of operations could suffer by way of example we have incurred expenses in exploring new technologies for storing electronic data including perpendicular recording technology which involves a different orientation for the magnetic field than is currently used in disc drives and heat assisted magnetic recording technology which uses heat generated by a laser to improve storage capacity we believe these new technologies could significantly improve the storage capacity of disc drives over the long term to date we have not yet developed a commercial product based on these technologies furthermore based on our recent experience in the industry with respect to new product introductions we believe that the rate of increase of areal density is slowing as compared to its previous levels which has lengthened the life cycles of existing products and may further postpone returns on our investments in new technologies if we have invested too much in new technologies our results of operations could be adversely affected in addition as we increase our capacity and capital spending as well as replace our existing assets with new higher cost assets we expect that our depreciation expense will increase which will contribute to our high level of fixed costs and reduce our earnings this could cause the market price of our common shares to decline 

  

customer concentration—consolidation among our customers could cause sales of our products to decline 

  

mergers acquisitions consolidations or other significant transactions involving our customers generally entail risks to our business for example ibm which is one of our key customers merged its disc drive business 

  

with the disc drive business of hitachi through the formation of a new company with which ibm has entered into a multiyear supply agreement as a result ibm may decrease its purchases from us in favor of this new company if a significant transaction involving any of our key customers results in the loss of or reduction in purchases by these key customers it could have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and prospects 

  

oem purchase agreements—our oem customers are not obligated to purchase our products 

  

typically our oem purchase agreements permit oems to cancel orders and reschedule delivery dates without significant penalties in the past orders from many of our oems were cancelled and delivery schedules were delayed as a result of changes in the requirements of the oems’ customers these order cancellations and delays in delivery schedules have had a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the past and may do so again in the future our oems and distributors typically furnish us with nonbinding indications of their near term requirements with product deliveries based on weekly confirmations if actual orders from distributors and oems decrease from their nonbinding forecasts these variances could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and prospects 

  

economic risks associated with international operations—our international operations subject us to risks related to currency exchange fluctuations longer payment cycles for sales in foreign countries seasonality and disruptions in foreign markets tariffs and duties price controls potential adverse tax consequences increased costs our customers’ credit and access to capital and healthrelated risks 

  

we have significant operations in foreign countries including manufacturing facilities sales personnel and customer support operations we have manufacturing facilities in china malaysia northern ireland singapore and thailand in addition to those in the united states a substantial portion of our desktop disc drive assembly occurs in our facility in china 

  

our international operations are subject to economic risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries including the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

political risks associated with international operations—our international operations subject us to risks related to political unrest and terrorism 

  

we have manufacturing facilities in parts of the world that periodically experience political unrest this could disrupt our ability to manufacture important components as well as cause interruptions andor delays in our ability to ship components to other locations for continued manufacture and assembly any such delays or interruptions could result in delays in our ability to fill orders and have an adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition us and international responses to the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 the ongoing hostilities in afghanistan and iraq and the risk of hostilities with north korea could exacerbate these risks 

  

legal and operational risks associated with international operations—our international operations subject us to risks related to staffing and management legal and regulatory requirements and the protection of intellectual property 

  

operating outside of the united states creates difficulties associated with staffing and managing our international manufacturing facilities complying with local legal and regulatory requirements and protecting our intellectual property we cannot assure you that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with applicable customs currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which we may be subject we also cannot assure you that these laws will not be modified 

  

risks associated with future acquisitions—we may not be able to identify suitable strategic alliance acquisition or investment opportunities or successfully acquire and integrate companies that provide complementary products or technologies 

  

our growth strategy may involve pursuing strategic alliances with and making acquisitions of or investments in other companies that are complementary to our business there is substantial competition for attractive strategic alliance acquisition and investment candidates we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition investment or strategic partnership candidates even if we were able to identify them we cannot assure you that we will be able to partner with acquire or invest in suitable candidates or integrate acquired technologies or operations successfully into our existing technologies and operations our ability to finance potential acquisitions will be limited by our high degree of leverage the covenants contained in the indenture that governs our outstanding 8 senior notes the credit agreement that governs our senior secured credit facilities and any agreements governing any other debt we may incur 

  

if we are successful in acquiring other companies these acquisitions may have an adverse effect on our operating results particularly while the operations of the acquired business are being integrated it is also likely 

  

that integration of acquired companies would lead to the loss of key employees from those companies or the loss of customers of those companies in addition the integration of any acquired companies would require substantial attention from our senior management which may limit the amount of time available to be devoted to our daytoday operations or to the execution of our strategy furthermore the expansion of our business involves the risk that we might not manage our growth effectively that we would incur additional debt to finance these acquisitions or investments and that we would incur substantial charges relating to the writeoff of inprocess research and development similar to that which we incurred in connection with several of our prior acquisitions each of these items could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 

  

potential loss of licensed technology—the closing of the november 2000 transactions may have triggered change of control or antiassignment provisions in some of our license agreements which could result in a loss of our right to use licensed technology 

  

we have a number of crosslicenses with third parties that enable us to manufacture our products free from any infringement claims that might otherwise be made by these third parties against us a number of these licenses contain change of control or antiassignment provisions we have taken steps to transfer these licenses in connection with the closing of the november 2000 transactions however we cannot assure you that these transfers will not be challenged for example papst licensing gmbh ibm and hitachi initially took the position that their license agreements did not transfer to our new business entities subsequently we entered into new license agreements with ibm and hitachi in december 2001 in september 2002 we settled a broader dispute with papst that also resolved the claim by papst that its license agreement was not properly transferred 

  

we received a letter dated november 20 2002 from readrite corporation asserting that we do not currently have a license to its patented technology and that our disc drive products infringe at least two of its patents we have since received additional letters from readrite corporation making the same claims seagate technology inc entered into a patent cross license agreement dated december 31 1994 which covered the two patents referenced in the november 20 2002 letter as well as other intellectual property of readrite corporation prior to the november 20 2002 letter readrite corporation had not responded to our efforts to confirm that under the patent cross license agreement we were entitled to a new license agreement in our own name and on materially the same terms as the 1994 agreement in order to clarify the parties’ rights under the patent cross license agreement we filed a declaratory judgment action on may 7 2003 in the superior court of california county of santa clara seeking a declaration that we are entitled to a crosslicense effective as of november 22 2000 under terms substantially identical to those contained in the patent cross license agreement on june 11 2003 readrite corporation answered the complaint putting forward a general denial and asserting various affirmative defenses on june 17 2003 readrite corporation filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under chapter 7 of the us bankruptcy code upon notice our declaratory judgment action has been stayed on july 23 2003 the us bankruptcy court approved western digital corporation’s bid to acquire the assets of readrite corporation including the intellectual property that was the subject of readrite’s dispute with us in a transaction that closed on july 31 2003 in the bankruptcy court we objected to the chapter 7 trustee’s assumption and assignment to western digital of the patent crosslicense agreement and the trustee ultimately rejected the agreement on november 14 2003 the bankruptcy trustee made a motion continued from time to time to assume or reject certain readrite executory contracts rejecting the patent crosslicense agreement on november 12 2004 we filed our election to retain the benefits of the patent crosslicense agreement to the extent permitted by section 365n of the us bankruptcy code the chapter 7 trustee and western digital opposed our election to retain the benefits of the license we have since reached agreement with the bankruptcy trustee subject to bankruptcy court approval to allow us to retain the benefits of the patent crosslicense in exchange for us withdrawing our proof of claim against the bankruptcy estate western digital objected to the settlement on july 7 2005 the bankruptcy trustee filed a motion to approve settlement of all bankruptcy disputes with western digital and indicated that he no longer supports the agreement we reached with him pursuant to this motion the bankruptcy trustee seeks approval to appoint western digital as the estate’s attorney in fact involving our election to retain the benefits of the patent crosslicense 

  

agreement the bankruptcy trustee withdrew his motion to approve the seagate settlement at a hearing on july 27 2005 the bankruptcy court approved the western digital settlement and set a hearing for september 28 2005 on our 365n election to retain the benefits of the patent crosslicense agreement 

  

to the extent that third party crosslicenses including the patent cross license agreement dated december 31 1994 between readrite corporation and seagate technology inc are deemed not to have been properly assigned to us in the november 2000 transactions our inability to either obtain new licenses or transfer existing licenses could result in delays in product development or prevent us from selling our products until equivalent substitute technology can be identified licensed andor integrated or until we are able to substantially engineer our products to avoid infringing the rights of third parties we might not be able to renegotiate agreements be able to obtain necessary licenses in a timely manner on acceptable terms or at all or be able to reengineer our products successfully moreover the loss of or inability to extend any of these licenses would increase the risk of infringement claims being made against us which claims could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

risk of intellectual property litigation—our products may infringe the intellectual property rights of others which may cause us to incur unexpected costs or prevent us from selling our products 

  

we cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of others historically patent applications in the united states and some foreign countries have not been publicly disclosed until the patent is issued and we may not be aware of currently filed patent applications that relate to our products or technology if patents are later issued on these applications we may be liable for infringement we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims including claims of alleged infringement of the patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties by us or our licensees in connection with their use of our products we are currently subject to a suit by convolve inc and the massachusetts institute of technology and a suit pending in nanjing china in addition as noted above readrite corporation in a letter dated november 20 2002 and in correspondence since that date asserted that we do not currently have a license to readrite corporation patented technology and that our disc drive products infringe at least two readrite corporation patents 

  

intellectual property litigation is expensive and timeconsuming regardless of the merits of any claim and could divert our management’s attention from operating our business in addition intellectual property lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties due to the complexity of the technical issues involved and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in defending ourselves against intellectual property claims moreover software patent litigation has increased due to the current uncertainty of the law and the increasing competition and overlap of product functionality in the field if we were to discover that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of others we would need to obtain licenses from these parties or substantially reengineer our products in order to avoid infringement we might not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms or at all or be able to reengineer our products successfully moreover if we are sued for infringement and lose the suit we could be required to pay substantial damages andor be enjoined from using or selling the infringing products or technology any of the foregoing could cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling our products 

  

dependence on intellectual property—if our intellectual property and other proprietary information were copied or independently developed by competitors our operating results would be negatively affected 

  

our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to protect and preserve the proprietary aspects of our technology however we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our technology without our authorization particularly in those countries where the laws do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states or protect us from independently developing or acquiring technology that is similar to ours for example in its bankruptcy proceedings under chapter 7 of the us bankruptcy code readrite corporation’s patents and other intellectual property rights were sold to western digital corporation who will use this intellectual property to compete against us the use of our technology or similar technology by others could 

  

reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business if it became necessary for us to resort to litigation to protect these rights any proceedings could be burdensome and costly and we may not prevail 

  

limitations on patent protection—our issued and pending patents may not adequately protect our intellectual property or provide us with any competitive advantage 

  

although we have numerous us and foreign patents and numerous pending patents that relate to our technology we cannot assure you that any patents issued or pending will provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged by third parties moreover our competitors may already have applied for patents that once issued will prevail over our patent rights or otherwise limit our ability to sell our products in the united states or abroad our competitors also may attempt to design around our patents or copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology with respect to our pending patent applications we may not be successful in securing patents for these claims our failure to secure these patents may limit our ability to protect the intellectual property rights that these applications were intended to cover 

  

disclosure of our proprietary technology—confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements may not adequately protect our proprietary technology or trade secrets 

  

we have entered into confidentiality agreements with our employees and nondisclosure agreements with customers suppliers and potential strategic partners among others if any party to these agreements were to violate their agreement with us and disclose our proprietary technology to a third party we may be unable to prevent the third party from using this information because a significant portion of our proprietary technology consists of specialized knowledge and technical expertise developed by our employees we have a program in place designed to ensure that our employees communicate any developments or discoveries they make to other employees however employees may choose to leave our company before transferring their knowledge and expertise to our other employees violations by others of our confidentiality or nondisclosure agreements and the loss of employees who have specialized knowledge and expertise could harm our competitive position and cause our sales and operating results to decline our trade secrets may otherwise become known or independently developed by others and trade secret laws provide no remedy against independent development or discovery 

  

service marks and trademarks—our failure to obtain trademark registrations or service marks or challenges to those marks could impede our marketing efforts 

  

we have registered and applied for some service marks and trademarks and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional service marks and trademarks as appropriate we cannot guarantee the approval of any of our pending applications by the applicable governmental authorities moreover even if the applications are approved third parties may seek to oppose or otherwise challenge these registrations a failure to obtain trademark registrations in the united states and in other countries could limit our ability to use our trademarks and impede our marketing efforts in those jurisdictions 

  

environmental matters—we could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs fines and civil or criminal sanctions as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws 

  

our operations inside and outside the united states are subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites in addition to the us federal state and local laws to which our domestic operations are subject our extensive international manufacturing operations subject us to environmental regulations imposed by foreign governments 

  

although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection at our sites inside and outside the united states we could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs fines and civil or criminal sanctions 

  

thirdparty property damage or personal injury claims if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or become noncompliant with environmental permits required at our facilities contaminants have been detected at some of our present and former sites principally in connection with historical operations in addition we have been named as a potentially responsible party at several superfund sites while we are not currently aware of any contaminated or superfund sites as to which material outstanding claims or obligations exist the discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of additional cleanup obligations at these or other sites could result in significant liability in addition the ultimate costs under environmental laws and the timing of these costs are difficult to predict liability under some environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can be imposed retroactively and on a joint and several basis in other words one liable party could be held liable for all costs at a site potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with environmental laws that may be adopted or imposed in the future 

  

dependence on key personnel—the loss of some key executive officers and employees could negatively impact our business prospects 

  

our future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued service of key members of management as well as marketing sales and product development personnel the loss of one or more of our key personnel would have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition we believe our future success will also depend in large part upon our ability to attract retain and further motivate highly skilled management marketing sales and product development personnel all of the incentive compensation provided to our senior management at the time of the privatization vested as of november 2004 we may not be able to provide our senior management with adequate additional incentives to remain employed by us after this time we have experienced intense competition for personnel and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our key employees or that we will be successful in attracting assimilating and retaining personnel in the future 

  

system failures—system failures caused by events beyond our control could adversely affect computer equipment and electronic data on which our operations depend 

  

our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer equipment and the information stored in our databases from damage by among other things earthquake fire natural disaster power loss telecommunications failures unauthorized intrusion and other catastrophic events as our operations become more automated and increasingly interdependent our exposure to the risks posed by these types of events will increase a significant part of our operations is based in an area of california that has experienced power outages and earthquakes and is considered seismically active we do not have a contingency plan for addressing the kinds of events referred to in this paragraph that would be sufficient to prevent system failures and other interruptions in our operations that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

substantial leverage—our substantial leverage may place us at a competitive disadvantage in our industry 

  

we are leveraged and have significant debt service obligations our significant debt and debt service requirements could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities for example our high level of debt presents the following risks to you 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

significant debt service requirements—servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate cash may be affected by factors beyond our control 

  

our business may not generate cash flow in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay the principal of or interest on our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs including working capital capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control we cannot assure you that 

  

   

   

   

if we cannot fund our liquidity needs we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances selling assets restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital we cannot assure you that any of these remedies could if necessary be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all in addition our existing debt instruments permit us to incur a significant amount of additional debt if we incur additional debt above the levels now in effect the risks associated with our substantial leverage including the risk that we will be unable to service our debt or generate enough cash flow to fund our liquidity needs could intensify 

  

restrictions imposed by debt covenants—restrictions imposed by our existing debt instruments will limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in our interest 

  

our existing debt instruments including the indenture governing our outstanding 8 senior notes impose and the terms of any future debt may impose operating and other restrictions on us the indenture governing our 8 senior notes limits our ability to incur additional indebtedness if our consolidated coverage ratio which is the ratio of the aggregate consolidated earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization or ebitda of our subsidiary seagate technology hdd holdings the issuer of our 8 senior notes and its restricted subsidiaries to the total interest expense of those entities is less than or equal to 3010 during any consecutive fourquarter period our existing debt instruments also limit among other things our ability to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

these covenants are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions including exceptions that permit us to make significant dividends in addition the obligation to comply with many of the covenants under the indenture governing our 8 senior notes will cease to apply if the notes achieve investment grade status 

  

our existing debt instruments also require us to achieve specified financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control 

  

a breach of any of the restrictive covenants described above or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our existing debt instruments if a default occurs the holders of our outstanding 8 senior notes may elect to declare all of our outstanding obligations together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable if our outstanding indebtedness were to be accelerated we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full that debt and any future indebtedness which would cause the market price of our common shares to decline significantly 

  

sox 404 compliance—while we believe that we currently have adequate internal control procedures in place we are still exposed to future risks of noncompliance and will continue to incur costs associated with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 

  

we have recently completed the evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting as required by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 although our assessment testing and evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of july 1 2005 our internal controls over financial reporting were effective we cannot predict the outcome of our testing in future periods if our internal controls are ineffective in future periods our financial results or the market price of our stock could be adversely affected we will incur additional expenses and commitment of management’s time in connection with further evaluations 

  

ownership of our common shares by our sponsor group—because our sponsor group through its ownership of new sac will continue to hold a significant interest in us the influence of our public shareholders over significant corporate actions will be limited 

  

as of july 26 2005 new sac owns approximately 303 of our outstanding common shares new sac was formed in connection with the november 2000 transactions and is owned by our sponsor group and members of our management through their ownership of new sac as of july 26 2005 affiliates of silver lake partners texas pacific group august capital jp morgan partners llc and investment partnerships affiliated with goldman sachs  co indirectly own approximately 96 67 35 20 and 07 respectively of our outstanding common shares in addition affiliates of silver lake partners texas pacific group august capital jp morgan partners llc and investment partnerships affiliated with goldman sachs  co directly own approximately 33 23 12 07 and 02 respectively of our outstanding common shares as of july 26 2005 

  

while new sac now holds less than 50 of our outstanding common shares and has lost certain contractual rights under our shareholders agreement it continues to have significant influence over matters such as the election of our directors control over business policies and affairs and other matters submitted to our shareholders also new sac is not prohibited from selling a significant interest in us to a third party 

  

accordingly our ability to engage in significant transactions such as a merger acquisition or liquidation is limited without the consent of new sac which is controlled by the members of our sponsor group conflicts of interest could arise between us and new sac or our sponsor group and any conflict of interest may be resolved in a manner that does not favor us the members of our sponsor group may continue to retain significant influence over us for the foreseeable future even after new sac distributes its shares in us to the new sac shareholders as it began to do in may 2005 and continued to do in july 2005 distributing an aggregate of approximately 50 million of our outstanding common shares owned by it the members of our sponsor group may decide not to enter into a transaction in which you would receive consideration for your common shares that is much higher than the cost to you or the thencurrent market price of those shares in addition the members of our sponsor group could elect to sell a significant interest in us and you may receive less than the thencurrent fair market value or the price you paid for your shares any decision regarding their ownership of us that members of our sponsor group may make at some future time will be in their absolute discretion 

  

future sales—additional sales of our common shares by new sac our sponsors or our employees or issuances by us in connection with future acquisitions or otherwise could cause the price of our common shares to decline 

  

if new sac or—after further distributions to our sponsors of our shares by new sac—our sponsors sell a substantial number of our common shares in the future the market price of our common shares could decline the perception among investors that these sales may occur could produce the same effect new sac and our sponsors have rights subject to specified conditions to require us to file registration statements covering common shares or to include common shares in registration statements that we may file specifically any of new sac silver lake partners texas pacific group or august capital can unilaterally require that we file registration statements covering common shares held by new sac in addition either silver lake partners or texas pacific group can unilaterally cause new sac to distribute its shares in us to our sponsor group and new sac’s other shareholders by exercising their registration or distribution rights and selling a large number of common shares new sac or any of the sponsors could cause the price of our common shares to decline furthermore if we were to include common shares in a registration statement initiated by us those additional shares could impair our ability to raise needed capital by depressing the price at which we could sell our common shares 

  

new sac has stated that it intends to continue to dispose of our remaining common shares that it holds in a series of orderly and disciplined transactions in 2005 and 2006 new sac stated that the disposition would be effected primarily through a combination of market sales under the registration statement on form s3 that we filed in january 2005 and through the distribution of our shares to new sac shareholders new sac also stated that it may sell our common shares from time to time under rule 144 which limits the volume of such sales in any 90day period to the greater of 1 of our outstanding shares or the average weekly trading volume of our shares during the four weeks preceding any trade in particular new sac stated that it expected to make quarterly distributions of 25000000 of our common shares owned by it to the new sac shareholders beginning in the spring of 2005 and continuing for the next three quarters thereafter for a total distribution in this manner of 100000000 common shares over the next year in may 2005 and july 2005 new sac distributed an aggregate of approximately 50000000 of our common shares owned by it to the new sac shareholders absent registration these distributed shares will be illiquid and not eligible for resale in the public markets under rule 144 until 12 months from the date of their distribution out of new sac the shareholders of new sac with the power to request registration of these shares have consented to an agreement among themselves not to do so for at least a year if at all 

  

one component of our business strategy is to make acquisitions in the event of any future acquisitions we could issue additional common shares which would have the effect of diluting your ownership percentage of the common shares and could cause the price of our common shares to decline 

  

volatile public markets—the price of our common shares may be volatile and could decline significantly 

  

the stock market in general and the market for technology stocks in particular has recently experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of companies if these market or industrybased fluctuations continue the trading price of our common shares could decline significantly independent of our actual operating performance and you could lose all or a substantial part of your investment the market price of our common shares could fluctuate significantly in response to several factors including among others 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

failure to pay quarterly dividends—our failure to pay quarterly dividends to our common shareholders could cause the market price of our common shares to decline significantly 

  

we paid quarterly dividends of 006 per share on each of august 20 2004 november 19 2004 and february 18 2005 to our common shareholders of record as of august 6 2004 november 5 2004 and february 4 2005 respectively on march 4 2005 our board of directors approved the increase of our quarterly dividend from 006 per share to no more than 008 per share we paid a quarterly dividend of 008 per share on may 20 2005 to our common shareholders of record as of may 6 2005 on july 19 2005 we declared a dividend of 008 per share to be paid on or before august 19 2005 to our common shareholders of record as of august 5 2005 

  

our ability to pay quarterly dividends will be subject to among other things general business conditions within the disc drive industry our financial results the impact of paying dividends on our credit ratings and legal and contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends by our subsidiaries to us or by us to our common shareholders including restrictions imposed by the covenants contained in the indenture governing our senior notes and the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities any reduction or discontinuation of quarterly dividends could cause the market price of our common shares to decline significantly moreover in the event our payment of quarterly dividends is reduced or discontinued our failure or inability to resume paying dividends at historical levels could result in a persistently low market valuation of our common shares 

  

taxation of distributions—us shareholders may be subject to us federal income tax on future distributions on our common shares 

  

because we did not have any current or accumulated earnings and profits for us federal income tax purposes for our taxable year ended july 1 2005 distributions on our common shares during this period were treated as a return of capital rather than dividend income for us federal income tax purposes there can be no assurance however that we will not have current or accumulated earnings and profits for us federal income tax purposes in future years to the extent that we have current or accumulated earnings and profits for us federal 

  

income tax purposes distributions on our common shares will not be treated as a return of capital distribution and will be treated as dividend income taxable to us shareholders if during fiscal year 2006 we engage in activities such as the repayment of our term loan the repurchase of our common shares etc which require significant usage of cash beyond the normal quarterly distributions to shareholders it is likely that we would generate current earnings and profits if this occurs all distributions made during fiscal year 2006 are anticipated to be treated as dividend income even if the activities occur after the distributions are made 

  

furthermore we believe that we were a foreign personal holding company for us federal income tax purposes for our taxable years ended july 1 2005 and july 2 2004 pursuant to the american jobs creation act of 2004 foreign corporations will be excluded from the application of the personal holding company rules of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” effective for taxable years of foreign corporations beginning after december 31 2004 for the company the effective date is its fiscal year beginning july 2 2005 as a result if taxable distributions on our common shares are made after july 1 2005 us shareholders who are individuals may be eligible for reduced rates of taxation applicable to certain dividend income currently a maximum rate of 15 on distributions made after the effective date 

  

because we are a foreign corporation for corporate shareholders the dividends will not be eligible for the dividendsreceived deduction generally allowed to us corporations in respect of dividends received from other us corporations dividends will be income from sources outside the united states 

  

potential governmental action—governmental action against companies located in offshore jurisdictions may lead to a reduction in the demand for our common shares 

  

recent federal and state legislation has been proposed and additional legislation may be proposed in the future which if enacted could have an adverse tax impact on either the company or its shareholders for example the eligibility for favorable tax treatment of taxable distributions paid to us shareholders of the company as qualified dividends could be eliminated 

  

securities litigation—significant fluctuations in the market price of our common shares could result in securities class action claims against us 

  

significant price and value fluctuations have occurred with respect to the publicly traded securities of disc drive companies and technology companies generally the price of our common shares is likely to be volatile in the future in the past following periods of decline in the market price of a company’s securities class action lawsuits have often been pursued against that company if similar litigation were pursued against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

limited protection of shareholder interests—holders of the common shares may face difficulties in protecting their interests because we are incorporated under cayman islands law 

  

our corporate affairs are governed by our third amended and restated memorandum and articles of association by the companies law 2004 revision and the common law of the cayman islands the rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under cayman islands law are not as clearly established as under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in jurisdictions in the united states therefore you may have more difficulty in protecting your interests in the face of actions by our management directors or controlling shareholder than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction in the united states due to the comparatively less developed nature of cayman islands law in this area 

  

unlike many jurisdictions in the united states cayman islands law does not specifically provide for shareholder appraisal rights on a merger or consolidation of a company this may make it more difficult for you to assess the value of any consideration you may receive in a merger or consolidation or to require that the offeror give you additional consideration if you believe the consideration offered is insufficient 

  

shareholders of cayman islands exempted companies such as ourselves have no general rights under cayman islands law to inspect corporate records and accounts or to obtain copies of lists of shareholders of the company our directors have discretion under our articles of association to determine whether or not and under what conditions our corporate records may be inspected by our shareholders but are not obliged to make them available to our shareholders this may make it more difficult for you to obtain the information needed to establish any facts necessary for a shareholder motion or to solicit proxies from other shareholders in connection with a proxy contest 

  

subject to limited exceptions under cayman islands law a minority shareholder may not bring a derivative action against the board of directors our cayman islands counsel is not aware of any reported class action or derivative action having been brought in a cayman islands court 

  

antitakeover provisions could discourage or prevent an acquisition of us—provisions of our articles of association and cayman islands corporate law may impede a takeover which could adversely affect the value of the common shares 

  

our articles of association permit our board of directors to issue preferred shares from time to time with such rights and preferences as they consider appropriate our board of directors could authorize the issuance of preferred shares with terms and conditions and under circumstances that could have an effect of discouraging a takeover or other transaction 

  

unlike many jurisdictions in the united states cayman islands law does not provide for mergers as that expression is understood under corporate law in the united states while cayman islands law does have statutory provisions that provide for the reconstruction and amalgamation of companies which are commonly referred to in the cayman islands as a “scheme of arrangement” the procedural and legal requirements necessary to consummate these transactions are more rigorous and take longer to complete than the procedures typically required to consummate a merger in the united states under cayman islands law and practice a scheme of arrangement in relation to a solvent cayman islands exempted company must be approved at a shareholders’ meeting by a majority of the company’s shareholders who are present and voting either in person or by proxy at such meeting the shares voted in favor of the scheme of arrangement must also represent at least 75 of the value of each class of the company’s shareholders excluding the shares owned by the parties to the scheme of arrangement present and voting at the meeting the grand court of the cayman islands must also sanction the convening of these meetings and the terms of the amalgamation although there is no requirement to seek the consent of the creditors of the parties involved in the scheme of arrangement the grand court typically seeks to ensure that the creditors have consented to the transfer of their liabilities to the surviving entity or that the scheme of arrangement does not otherwise materially adversely affect the creditors’ interests furthermore the grand court will only approve a scheme of arrangement if it is satisfied that 

  

   

   

   

   

enforcement of civil liabilities—holders of our common shares may have difficulty obtaining or enforcing a judgment against us because we are incorporated under the laws of the cayman islands 

  

because we are a cayman islands exempted company there is uncertainty as to whether the grand court of the cayman islands would recognize or enforce judgments of united states courts obtained against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof or be competent to hear original actions brought in the cayman islands against us predicated upon the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof 

  

   

interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and longterm debt we currently do not use derivative financial instruments in either our investment portfolio or to hedge debt 

  

we invest in high credit quality issuers and by policy limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer as stated in our policy we are averse to principal loss and ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk 

  

we mitigate default risk by maintaining a diversified portfolio and by investing in only high quality securities we constantly monitor our investment portfolio and position our portfolio to respond appropriately to a reduction in credit rating of any investment issuer guarantor or depository we maintain a highly liquid portfolio by investing only in marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets 

  

we have both fixed and floating rate debt obligations we enter into debt obligations to support general corporate purposes including capital expenditures and working capital needs we have used derivative financial instruments in the form of an interest rate swap agreement to hedge a portion of our floating rate debt obligations our last interest rate swap agreement matured in november 2002 we currently have no interest rate swap agreements 

  

the table below presents principal or notional amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio and debt obligations as of july 1 2005 all investments mature in three years or less 

  

   

foreign currency exchange risk we transact business in various foreign countries our primary foreign currency cash flows are in emerging market countries in asia and in european countries in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004 we instituted a foreign currency hedging program to protect against the increase in value of foreign currency cash flows resulting from expenses over the next year we hedge portions of our forecasted expenses denominated in foreign currencies with forward exchange contracts when the us dollar weakens significantly against the foreign currencies the increase in the value of the future foreign currency expenditure is offset by gains in the value of the forward contracts designated as hedges conversely as the us dollar strengthens the decrease in value of the future foreign currency cash flows is offset by losses in the value of the forward contracts 

  

as of july 1 2005 our notional fair values of foreign exchange forward contracts totaled 63 million we do not believe that these derivatives present significant credit risks because the counterparties to the derivatives consist of major financial institutions and we manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with any one counterparty we maintain settlement and revaluation limits as well as maximum tenor of contracts based on the credit rating of the financial institutions we do not enter derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes the table below provides information as of july 1 2005 about our derivative financial instruments comprised of foreign currency forward exchange contracts the table is provided in us dollar equivalent amounts and presents the notional amounts at the contract exchange rates and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates

we are a leader in the design manufacturing and marketing of rigid disc drives rigid disc drives which are commonly referred to as disc drives or hard drives are used as the primary medium for storing electronic information in systems ranging from desktop and notebook computers and consumer electronic devices to data centers delivering information over corporate networks and the internet we produce a broad range of rigid disc drive products that make us a leader in enterprise applications where our products are used in enterprise servers mainframes and workstations desktop applications where our products are used in pcs mobile computing applications where our products are used in notebook computers and consumer electronic applications where our products are used in digital video recorders dvr’s gaming platforms and digital music players 

  

we sell our rigid disc drives primarily to major original equipment manufacturers or oems and also market to distributors under our globally recognized brand name for fiscal years 2004 2003 and 2002 approximately 60 61 and 66 respectively of our rigid disc drive revenue was from sales to oems including customers such as hewlettpackard dell ibm emc and microsoft we have longstanding relationships with many of these oem customers we also have key relationships with major distributors who sell our rigid disc drive products to small oems dealers system integrators and retailers throughout most of the world also we are currently expanding our direct sales to retailers for fiscal years 2004 2003 and 2002 approximately 30 34 and 39 respectively of our revenue came from customers located in north america approximately 30 31 and 31 respectively came from customers located in europe and approximately 40 35 and 30 respectively came from customers located in the far east substantially all of our revenue is denominated in us dollars 

  

industry 

  

demand for electronic data storage 

  

we believe that the amount of data stored and accessed electronically is growing rapidly and that there are a number of key factors driving this demand we are particularly focused on three areas of growing demand for rigid disc drives 

  

growth in rigid disc drives for consumer electronics  highperformance computing and communications functions and increasingly rigid disc drives are being incorporated into consumer electronics devices such as video game consoles dvr’s and advanced television settop boxes in addition faster connections to the internet and increased broadband capacity have encouraged consumers to download greater amounts of text video and audio data expanding the market for rigid disc drives for use in new consumer and entertainment appliances the adoption and rapid growth of the use of rigid disc drives in these applications will be facilitated by the development of lowcost rigid disc drives that meet the pricing requirements of the consumer electronics market 

  

growth in rigid disc drives for mobile computing  the mobile computing market is expected to grow faster than any other pc segment as performance and price continue to improve placing notebook computers in an attractive position relative to desktop computers notebook systems are increasingly becoming replacement systems to desktop computers and progressively more desirable to consumers as the need for mobility increases and wireless adoption continues to advance in addition the industry continually progresses towards smaller systems and devices 

  

growth of storage area networks and network attached storage  the need to address the dramatic expansion in data storage management requirements has spurred the evolution of new storage and data management technologies enterprises are increasingly offloading network traffic to dedicated storage area networks or sans in addition many enterprises are moving away from the use of serverattached storage to networkattached storage or nas these solutions combine highperformance storage products that are comprised principally of rigid disc drives with sophisticated software and communications technologies we expect that the market for these solutions will grow rapidly and will result in greater opportunities for the sale of highperformance highcapacity rigid disc drives 

  

an emerging application in storage networking is the use of nearline storage systems this application uses less expensive discs to allow fast access to less frequently needed data 

  

success in our industry depends on technology and manufacturing leadership 

  

the design and manufacturing of rigid disc drives depends on highly advanced technology and manufacturing techniques especially in the areas of readwrite heads and recording media rigid disc drive manufacturers are distinguished by their level of integration which is the degree to which they control the technology used in their products and by whether they are captive producing rigid disc drives for their own computer systems or independent integrated manufacturers are companies that design and produce the critical technologies including readwrite heads and recording media used in their rigid disc drives an integrated approach enables them to lower manufacturing costs and to improve the functionality of components so that they work together efficiently in contrast manufacturers that are not integrated purchase most of their components from thirdparty suppliers upon whom they depend for key elements of their technological innovation and differentiation this can limit their ability to coordinate technology roadmaps and optimize the component design process for manufacturing efficiency and product reliability while making them reliant on the technology investment decisions of their suppliers independent manufacturers can enjoy a competitive advantage over captive manufacturers in working with oems because they do not compete with oems for computer system sales 

  

due to the significant challenges posed by the need to continually innovate and improve manufacturing efficiency the rigid disc drive industry continues to undergo significant consolidation as manufacturers and merchant component suppliers merge with other companies or exit the industry for instance ibm merged its rigid disc drive business with that of hitachi through the formation of hitachi global storage technologies a separate company consolidation is likely to continue in our industry as the technological challenges and the associated levels of required investment grow increasing the competitive necessity of largescale operations we believe the competitive dynamics of the rigid disc drive industry favor integrated independent manufacturers with the scale to make substantial technology investments and apply them across a broad product portfolio and set of customers 

  

overview of rigid disc drive technology 

  

all rigid disc drives incorporate the same basic technology although individual products vary one or more rigid discs are attached to a spindle assembly powered by a spindle motor that rotates the discs at a high constant speed around a hub the discs or recording media are the components on which data is stored and from which it is retrieved each disc typically consists of a substrate of finely machined aluminum or glass with a layer of a 

  

thinfilm magnetic material readwrite heads mounted on an arm assembly similar in concept to that of a record player fly extremely close to each disc surface and record data on and retrieve it from concentric tracks in the magnetic layers of the rotating discs the readwrite heads are mounted vertically on an eshaped assembly the eblock and the recording media are mounted inside a metal casing called the base casting 

  

upon instructions from the drive’s electronic circuitry a head positioning mechanism or actuator guides the heads to the selected track of a disc where the data is recorded or retrieved application specific integrated circuits or asics and ancillary electronic control chips are collectively mounted on printed circuit boards asics move data to and from the readwrite head and the internal controller or interface which communicates with the host computer rigid disc drive manufacturers typically use one or more of several industry standard interfaces such as advanced technology architecture or ata serial ata which provides higher data transfer rates than the previous ata standard small computer system interface or scsi and fibre channel 

  

rigid disc drive performance is commonly assessed by six key characteristics 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

areal density is a measure of storage capacity per square inch on the recording surface of a disc current areal densities are sufficient to meet the requirements of most applications today although the rate of increase in areal density is slowing we expect the longterm demand for increased drive capacities to continue to increase as audio and visual data require many multiples of the storage capacity of simple text we have pursued and expect to continue to pursue a range of technologies to increase areal densities across the entire range of our products to increase drive capacities and to enable the production of higher capacity smaller form factor disc drives 

  

manufacturing 

  

we pursue an integrated business strategy based on the ownership of critical component technologies this strategy allows us to maintain control over our product roadmap and component cost quality and availability our manufacturing efficiency and flexibility is a critical element of our integrated business strategy during the past several years we have made significant improvements in our manufacturing efficiency by 

  

   

   

   

   

   

manufacturing our rigid disc drives is a complex process that begins with the production of individual components and ends with a fully assembled unit we design assemble andor manufacture a number of the most important components found in our rigid disc drives including readwrite heads recording media printed circuit boards spindle motors and asics 

  

readwrite heads  the function of the readwrite head is to scan across the disc as it spins magnetically recording or reading information the tolerances of recording heads are extremely demanding and require stateoftheart equipment and processes our readwrite heads are manufactured with thinfilm and photolithographic processes similar to those used to produce semiconductor integrated circuits beginning with six inch round ceramic wafers we process more than 25000 head elements at one time each of these head elements goes through more than 300 steps all in clean room environments our readwrite heads require highly advanced processes with tolerances approaching the thickness of a single atom we perform all primary stages of design and manufacture of readwrite heads at our facilities although the percentage of our requirements for readwrite heads that we produce internally varies periodically we currently manufacture all of our readwrite heads 

  

recording media  the function of the recording media is to magnetically store information the domains where each bit of magnetic code is stored are extremely small and precisely placed as a result the manufacturing of recording media requires sophisticated thinfilm processes each disc is a sequentially processed set of layers that consist of structural magnetic protective and lubricating materials once complete the disc must have a high degree of physical uniformity to assure reliable and errorfree storage we purchase aluminum substrate blanks for recording media production from third parties mainly in japan these blanks are machined plated and polished to produce finished substrates at our plant in northern ireland we also purchase glass substrates from third parties in japan for use in our mobile and small form factor consumer electronic products although the percentage of our requirements for recording media that we produce internally varies from quarter to quarter we currently manufacture almost all of our recording media requirements we are in the process of expanding our media production facility in singapore to further increase our production capacity our strategy is to purchase no more than 20 of our recording media requirements from thirdparty suppliers in any given quarter 

  

printed circuit boards  we assemble and test a significant portion of the printed circuit boards used in our rigid disc drives printed circuit boards are the boards that contain the electronic circuitry and asics that provide the electronic controls of the rigid disc drive and on which the headdisc assembly is mounted we assemble printed circuit boards at our facilities in malaysia and china 

  

spindle motors  we participate in the design of most of our spindle motors and purchase them principally from outside vendors in asia whom we have licensed to use our intellectual property and technology 

  

asics  we participate in the design of many of the asics used in our rigid disc drives for motor and actuator control such as interface controllers readwrite channels and preamplifiers we do not manufacture any asics but rather buy them from thirdparty suppliers 

  

following the production of the individual components of the rigid disc drive the first step in the manufacture of a rigid disc drive itself is the assembly of the actuator arm readwrite heads discs and spindle motor in a housing to form the headdisc assembly the production of the headdisc assembly involves largely automated processes printed circuit boards are then mated to the headdisc assembly and the completed unit is tested prior to packaging and shipment final assembly and test operations of our rigid disc drives occur primarily at facilities located in china and singapore we perform subassembly and component manufacturing operations at our facilities in china malaysia northern ireland singapore thailand and in the united states in california and minnesota in addition third parties manufacture and assemble components for us in various asian countries including china japan korea malaysia the philippines singapore taiwan and thailand and in europe and the united states 

  

products 

  

we offer a broad range of 35inch form factor rigid disc drive products for the enterprise desktop and consumer electronics sectors of the rigid disc drive industry during fiscal year 2004 we introduced the momentus family of 25inch rigid disc drives for notebook computers also during fiscal year 2004 we introduced savvio our first 25inch enterprise disc drive we offer more than one product within each product family and differentiate products on the basis of priceperformance and form factor or the dimensions of the rigid disc drive historically our industry has been characterized by continuous and significant advances in technology which contributed to rapid product life cycles however based upon the recent pace of new product introductions we believe that our industry is currently in a period in which the rate of increases in areal density which is the storage capacity per square inch on a disc is lower than the rate of the last several years resulting in longer product life cycles we list in the table below our main current product offerings 

  

   

in june 2004 we announced 12 new rigid disc drive products which will be introduced in fiscal year 2005 including

customers 

  

we sell our rigid disc drive products primarily to major oems and distributors oem customers incorporate our rigid disc drives into computer systems and storage systems for resale distributors typically sell our rigid disc drives to small oems dealers system integrators and other resellers shipments to oems were approximately 60 61 and 66 of our revenue in fiscal years 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively shipments to distributors were approximately 40 39 and 34 of our revenue in fiscal years 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively sales to hewlettpackard accounted for approximately 19 and 18 of our rigid disc drive revenue in fiscal years 2004 and 2003 respectively sales to hewlettpackard and compaq together accounted for approximately 20 of our rigid disc drive revenue in fiscal year 2002 no other customer accounted for 10 or more of our rigid disc drive revenue in fiscal years 2004 2003 and 2002 also we are currently expanding our direct sales to retailers see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—risk factors—risks related to our business—dependence on key customers” 

  

oem customers typically enter into master purchase agreements with us these agreements provide for pricing volume discounts order lead times product support obligations and other terms and conditions the term of these agreements is usually 12 to 36 months although our product support obligations generally extend substantially beyond this period these master agreements typically do not commit the customer to buy any minimum quantity of products or create exclusive relationships deliveries are scheduled only after receipt of purchase orders in addition with limited leadtime customers may cancel or defer most purchase orders without significant penalty anticipated orders from many of our customers have in the past failed to materialize or oem delivery schedules have been deferred or altered as a result of changes in their business needs 

  

our distributors generally enter into nonexclusive agreements for the redistribution of our products they typically furnish us with a nonbinding indication of their nearterm requirements and product deliveries are generally scheduled based on a weekly confirmation by the distributor of its requirements for that week the agreements typically provide the distributors with price protection with respect to their inventory of our rigid disc drives at the time of a reduction by us in our selling price for the rigid disc drives and also provide limited rights to return the product 

  

we also regularly enter into agreements with our customers which obligate us to provide a limited indemnity against losses resulting from intellectual property claims these agreements are customary in our industry and typically require us to indemnify our customer against certain damages and costs incurred as a result of third party intellectual property claims arising as a result of their use of our products

foreign sales are subject to foreign exchange controls and other restrictions including in the case of some countries approval by the office of export administration of the us department of commerce and other us governmental agencies 

  

competition 

  

the rigid disc drive industry is intensely competitive with manufacturers competing for a limited number of major customers some of the principal factors used by customers to differentiate among rigid disc drive manufacturers are 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we believe that our products are generally competitive with respect to each of these factors in the markets that we currently address we summarize below our principal competitors the effect of competition on price erosion for our products and product life cycles and technology 

  

principal competitors  we have experienced and expect to continue to experience intense competition from a number of domestic and foreign companies some of which have greater financial and other resources 

  

than we have these competitors include other independent rigid disc drive manufacturers such as maxtor and western digital as well as large captive manufacturers such as fujitsu hitachi global storage technologies samsung and toshiba because they produce complete computer systems captive manufacturers can derive a greater portion of their operating margins from other components which reduces their need to realize a profit on the rigid disc drives included in their computer systems and allows them to sell rigid disc drives to third parties at very low margins many captive manufacturers are also formidable competitors because they have more substantial resources and greater access to their internal customers than we do in addition hitachi global storage technologies together with affiliated entities and samsung electronics incorporated also sell other products to our customers including critical components like flash memory applicationspecific integrated circuits or asics and flat panel displays and may be willing to sell their disc drives at a lower margin to advance their overall business strategy we also face indirect competition from present and potential customers who evaluate from time to time whether to manufacture their own rigid disc drives and other information storage products or purchase them from outside sources other than us these manufacturers also sell rigid disc drives to third parties which results in direct competition with us we expect that continued consolidation both among independent manufacturers and among captive manufacturers will increase the threat posed to our business by these competitors during the last few years three additional competitors have entered the market cornice and gs magicstor offering 1inch disc drives and excelstor as a contract manufacturer of desktop disc drives 

  

price erosion  our competitors have historically offered new or existing products at lower prices as part of a strategy to gain or retain market share and customers and we expect these practices to continue even during periods when demand for rigid disc drives is stable our industry is price competitive and vendors experience price erosion over the life of a product such price erosion has increased as product life cycles have lengthened due to a slowing in the rate of increase in areal density this slowing of the areal density curve may contribute to increases in average price erosion to the extent that historical price erosion patterns continue product life cycles are lengthened our competitors have more time to enter the market for a particular product and we are unable to offset this with new products at higher average prices we expect that price erosion in our industry will continue for the foreseeable future to remain competitive we believe it will be necessary to continue to reduce our prices we have established production facilities in china malaysia singapore and thailand to achieve cost reductions 

  

product life cycles and changing technology  historically competition and changing customer preference and demand in the rigid disc drive industry have shortened product life cycles and caused acceleration in the development and introduction of new technology based on the recent pace of new product introductions however we believe that the current rate of increase in areal density is slowing from the rate of the last several years and the resulting variability in product life cycles may make planning for product transitions more difficult we believe that our future success will depend upon our ability to develop manufacture and market products of high quality and reliability which meet changing user needs and which successfully anticipate or respond to changes in technology and standards on a costeffective and timely basis 

  

research and development 

  

we are committed to developing new component technologies and products and evaluating alternative technologies we have increased our focus on research and development and realigned our rigid disc drive development process this structured product process is designed to bring new products to market through predictable and repeatable methodologies seagate research which is based in pittsburgh pennsylvania is dedicated to extending the capacity of magnetic and optical recording and exploring alternative data storage technologies including perpendicular recording technology and heat assisted magnetic recording technology perpendicular recording technology involves a different orientation for the magnetic field than is currently used in rigid disc drives and heat assisted magnetic recording technology uses heat generated by a laser to improve storage capacity our advanced technology integration effort focuses rigid disc drive and component research on recording subsystems including readwrite heads and recording media marketspecific product technology as well as technology focused towards new business opportunities the primary purpose of our advanced 

  

technology integration effort is to ensure timely availability of mature component technologies to our product development teams as well as allowing us to leverage and coordinate those technologies in the design centers across our products in order to take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace during fiscal years 2004 2003 and 2002 we had product development expenses of 666 million 670 million and 698 million respectively 

  

patents and licenses 

  

as of july 2 2004 we had approximately 2456 us patents and 726 patents issued in various foreign jurisdictions as well as approximately 1194 us and 1204 foreign patent applications pending the number of patents and patent applications will vary at any given time as part of our ongoing patent portfolio management activity due to the rapid technological change that characterizes the information storage industry we believe that the improvement of existing products reliance upon trade secret law the protection of unpatented proprietary knowhow and development of new products are generally more important than patent protection in establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage nevertheless we believe that patents are valuable to our business and intend to continue our efforts to obtain patents where available in connection with our research and development program 

  

the information storage industry is characterized by significant litigation relating to patent and other intellectual property rights because of rapid technological development in the information storage industry some of our products have been and in the future could be alleged to infringe existing patents of third parties from time to time we receive claims that our products infringe patents of third parties although we have been able to resolve some of those claims or potential claims by obtaining licenses or rights under the patents in question without a material adverse affect on us other claims have resulted in adverse decisions or settlements in addition other claims are pending which if resolved unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations for more information on these claims see “item 3 legal proceedings” the costs of engaging in intellectual property litigation may be substantial regardless of the merit of the claim or the outcome we have patent crosslicenses with a number of companies additionally as part of our normal intellectual property practices we are engaged in negotiations with other major rigid disc drive companies and component manufacturers with respect to ongoing patent crosslicenses for a discussion of the related risks see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—risk factors—risks related to our business—potential loss of licensed technology” 

  

backlog 

  

in view of customers’ rights to cancel or defer orders with little or no penalty we believe backlog in the rigid disc drive industry is of limited indicative value in estimating future performance and results 

  

employees 

  

at july 2 2004 we employed approximately 40000 persons worldwide of which approximately 30000 employees were located in our asian operations in addition we make use of temporary employees principally in manufacturing who are hired on an asneeded basis we believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees at all levels and even then we cannot assure you of any such success we believe that our employee relations are good 

  

environmental matters 

  

our operations are subject to comprehensive us and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites some of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution and these permits are subject to modification renewal and revocation by issuing authorities 

  

we believe that our operations are currently in substantial compliance with all environmental laws regulations and permits we incur operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental laws if additional or more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future we could incur additional operating costs and capital expenditures 

  

some environmental laws such as the us federal superfund law and similar state statutes can impose liability for the cost of cleanup of contaminated sites upon any of the current or former site owners or operators or upon parties who sent waste to these sites regardless of whether the owner or operator owned the site at the time of the release of hazardous substances or the lawfulness of the original disposal activity we have been identified as a potentially responsible party at several superfund sites at each of these sites the government has assigned to us a portion of the financial liability based on the type and amount of hazardous substances disposed of by each party at the site and the number of financially viable parties 

  

some of our current and former sites have a history of commercial and industrial operations including the use of hazardous substances groundwater and soil contamination resulting from historical operations has been identified at several of our current and former facilities and we are addressing the cleanup of these sites in cooperation with the relevant government agencies 

  

while our ultimate costs in connection with these sites is difficult to predict with complete accuracy based on our current estimates of cleanup costs and our expected allocation of these costs we do not expect costs in connection with these superfund sites and contaminated sites to be material

an indemnification agreement provided that new sac and its subsidiaries would be required to indemnify veritas and its affiliates for specified liabilities of seagate delaware and seagate software holdings inc including selected taxes in return veritas seagate delaware and their affiliates agreed to indemnify new sac and its subsidiaries for specified liabilities including all taxes of seagate delaware for which new sac would not be obligated to indemnify veritas and its affiliates veritas deposited 150 million in an escrow account which could be applied by new sac to satisfy certain tax liabilities and which remained in the escrow account in full to the extent that any part of the 150 million was not utilized to satisfy these tax liabilities it would be paid out to the former seagate delaware stockholders in july 2002 we and those of our affiliates that were parties to the indemnification agreement entered into a reimbursement agreement which allocated the respective liabilities and obligations under the indemnification agreement 

  

under the reimbursement agreement if we and our affiliates became obligated to indemnify seagate delaware veritas or any of their affiliates for tax liabilities under the indemnification agreement seagate technology hdd holdings would be responsible for the first 125 million of the tax liabilities and any amount exceeding 125 million would then be allocated among seagate technology hdd holdings seagate technology san holdings certance holdings and seagate software cayman holdings corporation on a pro rata basis in accordance with the portion of the purchase price allocated to each entity in connection with the november 2000 transactions for indemnification obligations other than tax liabilities under the indemnification agreement the responsible entity would reimburse any entity that satisfied the obligation on its behalf

in may 2002 we made 32 million in payments to participants in the deferred compensation plan on june 19 2002 the board of directors accelerated vesting of all deferred compensation interests under the terms of the plan and we subsequently recorded an accrual of 147 million in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2002 as a result of certain distributions by new sac to holders of its preferred shares in connection with our initial public offering seagate technology hdd holdings became obligated to pay out the 147 million to participants of its deferred compensation plan including named executive officers those payments were made following the closing of our initial public offering thereby satisfying all remaining obligations under the deferred compensation plan 

  

new sac redeemed all of its outstanding preferred shares as of march 14 2003 as of july 2 2004 there were 2251011 restricted ordinary shares outstanding we have been recognizing and will continue to recognize compensation expense of approximately 28 million proportionately over the respective vesting periods based on the estimated fair value of these shares of the date of issuance through july 2 2004 we had recognized 27 million of this compensation expense 

  

consummation of initial public offering 

  

in december 2002 we completed the initial public offering of 72500000 of our common shares 24000000 of which were sold by us and 48500000 of which were sold by new sac our controlling shareholder at a price of 12 per share we received proceeds from our sale of the 24000000 newly issued common shares of approximately 270 million after deducting underwriting fees discounts and commissions in connection with our initial public offering new sac converted its 400000000 shares of our preferred stock into common stock immediately prior to the closing of our initial public offering we paid a return of capital distribution of 262 million or 065 per share to the holders of our thenoutstanding shares including new sac we also paid a lump sum of approximately 12 million to members of our sponsor group in exchange for the discontinuation of an annual monitoring fee of 2 million this payment was charged to marketing and administrative expense during our second fiscal quarter of 2002 

  

new sac received proceeds of approximately 557 million from the sale of 48500000 common shares in our initial public offering after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions new sac distributed these net proceeds together with the proceeds from the distribution described above to holders of its preferred and ordinary shares as a result of the distribution to new sac’s preferred shareholders our whollyowned subsidiary seagate technology hdd holdings became obligated to make payments of approximately 147 million to the participants in its deferred compensation plan these payments were made following the closing of our initial public offering and as a consequence there are no longer any outstanding obligations under that deferred compensation plan

overview 

  

industry overview our industry is characterized by several trends that have a material impact on our strategic planning financial condition and results of operations historically our industry has been characterized by continuous and significant advances in technology which contributed to rapid product life cycles the importance of being first to market with new products and the difficulty in recovering research and development expenses however based upon the recent pace of new product introductions we believe that our industry is currently in a period in which the rate of increases in areal density which is the storage capacity per square inch on a disc is lower than the rate of the last several years the slowing change in areal density contributes to 

  

   

   

   

we also believe that the industry is experiencing several positive trends relative to overall demand including 

  

   

   

   

in the first half of fiscal year 2004 we observed what we believe to be a shift in seasonal demand for disc drives used in desktop and consumer electronics markets we believe the seasonally high demand for disc drives used in these markets may be shifting more toward our first fiscal quarter from our second fiscal quarter we believe this trend will continue and due to the increasing importance of the consumer electronics market to our business will impact our revenue and results of operations in these quarters 

  

another key factor is the continued importance of sales to the distribution channel product qualification programs in this channel are limited which increases the number of competing products that are available to satisfy demand particularly in times of lengthening product cycles as a result purchasing decisions in this channel are based largely on price terms and product availability and unit sales growth is less predictable and has greater fluctuation than sales to oem customers to the extent that our industry builds product based on expectations of demand that do not materialize distributors may experience an oversupply of personal storage products that could lead to increased price erosion as sales to distributors become an increasingly larger portion of total industry sales disc drive manufacturers may experience increased volatility in their results of operations 

  

seagate overview we maintain a highly integrated approach to our business by designing and manufacturing components we view as critical to our products such as readwrite heads and recording media we believe that our control of these key technologies combined with our innovations in manufacturing enable us to achieve product performance timetomarket leadership and manufacturing flexibility which allows us to respond to customers and market opportunities although we derive an important competitive advantage as a result of this strategy it results in higher fixed costs which may adversely affect our financial performance particularly in periods of declining demand and in periods of slower growth in the areal density curve such as we are now experiencing to offset these higher fixed costs we are continuously engaged in efforts to reduce our costs and improve our manufacturing efficiencies and flexibility this approach also increases the importance of realizing and maintaining substantial market share in the markets in which we compete allowing us to spread our technology investments across a high unit volume of products 

  

a significant portion of our success historically has been a result of increasing our market share at the expense of our competitors however in the first fiscal quarter of 2004 our market share for our enterprise products was negatively affected by our customers’ diversifying their sources of supply as the slowing areal density curve has resulted in longer product cycles and more time for our competitors to enter the market for particular products additionally in the second half of fiscal year 2004 our market share for notebook drive products was negatively affected by an oversupply condition in our customers’ supply chain during june 2004 however we announced 12 new products which will address every major computing application and all major consumer markets thereby expanding our current addressable market from approximately 75 to approximately 97 we believe that our nearterm financial results will depend heavily on the successful introduction and customer acceptance of these new products 

  

we are dependent on our sales to distributors however in the distribution channel unit sales growth is less predictable and has greater fluctuation than sales to oem customers to the extent that our industry builds product based on expectations of demand that do not materialize distributors may experience an oversupply of personal storage products that could lead to increased price erosion during our second fiscal quarter of 2004 ended january 2 2004 we observed lower than anticipated sellthrough in the distribution channel we believe our experience was consistent with that of our industry we believe that this lower than anticipated sellthrough taken together with the level of industry production created increased pressure on pricing and terms and resulted in historically high industry channel inventories at the end of the december quarter during the march quarter a number of disc drive manufacturers independently launched initiatives to improve the stability of the distribution channel particularly with respect to the purchasing behavior of distributors while other disc drive manufacturers have not these initiatives included efforts to develop pointofsale information systems to help match supply and demand pricing increases and alteration of distribution programs as the distribution channel reacts to these various activities there may be increased volatility of sales in this channel for individual disc drive manufacturers we exited the june quarter with approximately 5 weeks of distribution channel inventory or 

  

approximately one million units lower than the march quarter to the extent that our distributor customers reduce their purchases of our products or prices decline significantly in the distribution channel our results of operations would be adversely affected 

  

during periods of slowing growth of areal density and longer product cycles we may experience heightened pricing pressures this pricing pressure has contributed to a reduction in gross margins to the extent that these pricing pressures continue our gross margin may be negatively affected furthermore the favorable impact of new product introductions on our results of operations may be minimized historically the introduction of new products generally has had a favorable impact on our results of operations both because the new products are introduced at higher prices than existing competitive offerings and because advances in areal density technology have enabled lower manufacturing costs through reduction in components such as readwrite heads and rigid discs however in contrast to when the rate of growth in areal density is increasing a slowing growth rate in areal density can limit the cost benefits of new products because it is technologically more difficult to reduce the number of readwrite heads and rigid discs in a particular drive in addition given the environment of intense price competition in the absence of significant capacity increases or improvements in reliability it is difficult to obtain higher prices for new products 

  

we believe that we and the hard drive industry are in a unique and challenging period of time with longer product cycles continued aggressive pricing in the core markets and ongoing changes in how we serve our distribution channel partners all of these may impact our nearterm profitability in our fourth fiscal quarter of 2004 we undertook significant restructuring activities to reduce the costs of our operations in light of our declining revenue gross margins and earnings over the past several quarters resulting from recent significant price erosion and market share variability particularly with respect to our enterprise disc drive products we continue to look at opportunities for further cost reductions which may result in additional restructuring activities and restructuring charges in the future during this challenging period the management team will continue to be intensely focused on maintaining profitability excluding the impact of any restructuring charges that we may incur 

  

results of operations 

  

we list in the tables below the historical consolidated statements of operations in dollars and as a percentage of revenue for the fiscal years indicated 

  

   

   

fiscal year 2004 compared to fiscal year 2003 

  

revenue revenue for fiscal year 2004 was 6224 billion down 4 from 6486 billion in fiscal year 2003 the decrease in revenue was primarily due to price erosion particularly with respect to our enterprise storage products partially offset by an increase in unit shipments our unit shipments increased from 68 million units in fiscal year 2003 to 79 million units in fiscal year 2004 this increase in unit shipments was primarily in our desktop storage products and was due to an increase in the total available market as well as our share of the total available market additionally shipments increased as a result of the introduction of our mobile computing storage product 

  

our overall average unit sales price for our rigid disc drive products was 81 80 76 and 71 for the first second third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2004 respectively average annual price erosion from fiscal year 2003 to fiscal year 2004 was approximately 18 

  

unit shipments for desktop storage disc drives were 590 million for fiscal year 2004 up from 523 million in fiscal year 2003 however we did experience a slight decline in drive shipments for desktop applications in the fourth fiscal quarter which can be attributed to an unexpected decline in industry distribution channel sellthrough despite this decline we believe that we maintained our market share 

  

unit shipments for enterprise storage disc drives were 104 million during fiscal year 2004 slightly down from 105 million in fiscal year 2003 and although we continue to experience aggressive pricing we believe we maintained our market share 

  

during fiscal year 2004 we shipped 36 million mobile computing disc drives we continue to be impacted by our limited product set for this market and our concentrated customer base we also experienced aggressive pricing in the first half of calendar year 2004 as we leverage this product platform and expand our product offerings later in calendar year 2004 we expect to penetrate more of the mobile computing market and capture additional customers revenue and market share 

  

unit shipments for consumer electronics storage disc drives were 63 million during fiscal year 2004 which represents a 33 increase in shipments from fiscal year 2003 this reflects strong growth in shipments to dvr consumer electronics applications until now we have only participated in the portion of the consumer electronics market where 35inch form factors drives are utilized beginning in our first fiscal quarter of 2005 we will add to our consumer electronics offerings with the previously announced st1 our new 5 gigabyte 

  

1inch form factor rigid disc drive targeted at a variety of handheld consumer electronics applications such as digital music players and digital cameras 

  

we continued to maintain various sales programs aimed at increasing customer demand we exercise judgment in formulating the underlying estimates related to distributor inventory levels sales program participation and customer claims submittals in determining the provision for such programs during fiscal year 2004 sales programs issued and recorded as contrarevenue were approximately 7 of our gross revenue compared to 5 of our gross revenue for fiscal year 2003 the increase in the provision for sales programs as a percentage of our gross revenue in fiscal year 2004 as compared to fiscal year 2003 was the result of higher distribution unit sales particularly in the first half of fiscal year 2004 

  

cost of revenue cost of revenue for fiscal year 2004 was 4765 billion and was flat from 4759 billion in fiscal year 2003 gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2004 was 23 as compared with 27 for fiscal year 2003 the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to price erosion as a result of fewer new product introductions and longer product cycles caused by a slowing in the rate of increase in areal density gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the first second third and fourth fiscal quarters of 2004 was 27 26 22 and 17 respectively 

  

product development expense product development expense decreased by 4 million or 1 for fiscal year 2004 when compared with fiscal year 2003 the decrease in product development expense from fiscal year 2003 was primarily due to decreases of 30 million in employee incentive compensation a 6 million business development grant received in fiscal year 2003 4 million in legal expense and the absence of 4 million in product development expense incurred in the yearago period by xiotech which we sold in fiscal year 2003 these decreases were partially offset by increases of 21 million in salaries as a result of increased headcount and annual merit increases 11 million in program materials and 7 million in depreciation 

  

marketing and administrative expense marketing and administrative expense decreased by 67 million or 19 for fiscal year 2004 when compared with fiscal year 2003 the decrease in marketing and administrative expense from fiscal year 2003 was primarily due to the absence of 16 million in marketing and administrative expense incurred by xiotech which we sold in fiscal year 2003 and decreases of 12 million related to the discontinuation of an annual monitoring fee paid to certain new sac investors 7 million in compensation expense pursuant to executive terminations all of which occurred in fiscal year 2003 as well as 18 million in employee incentive compensation and 12 million in outside services 

  

restructuring during fiscal year 2004 we recorded 59 million in restructuring charges of the 59 million 39 million was incurred in the quarter ended july 2 2004 and was associated with the planned workforce reduction that we first announced in april 2004 and implemented in june 2004 the 39 million restructuring charge was comprised of employee termination costs relating to a workforce reduction primarily in our us and far east operations of approximately 2407 employees 1626 of whom had been terminated as of july 2 2004 we expect the restructuring activities related to the charge taken in our fourth fiscal quarter of 2004 to be substantially completed by august 2004 

  

the remaining 20 million in restructuring charges were incurred through the nine months ended april 2 2004 as a result of a restructuring plan established to continue the alignment of our global workforce with existing and anticipated future market requirements primarily in our us design centers and far east operations the restructuring costs were comprised of employee termination costs relating to a reduction in our workforce of approximately 649 employees 626 of whom had been terminated as of july 2 2004 the restructuring activities taken through the nine months ended april 2 2004 were substantially complete at july 2 2004 

  

upon completion of the fiscal year 2004 restructuring activities we estimate that annual salary expense will be reduced by approximately 95 million we continue to look at opportunities for further cost reductions which may result in additional restructuring activities and restructuring charges in the future 

  

net other income expense net other expense decreased 15 million or 48 for fiscal year 2004 when compared with fiscal year 2003 the decrease in net other expense from fiscal year 2003 was primarily due to a decrease of 8 million in writedowns of our investment in a private company a 4 million change in the value of the underlying assets of the rabbi trust associated with the deferred compensation plan 

  

income taxes we recorded a benefit from income taxes of 101 million for the fiscal year ended july 2 2004 compared to a provision for income taxes of 19 million for the fiscal year ended june 27 2003 we are a foreign holding company incorporated in the cayman islands with foreign and us subsidiaries that operate in multiple taxing jurisdictions as a result our worldwide operating income is either subject to varying rates of tax or is exempt from tax due to tax holidays or tax incentive programs we operate under in china malaysia singapore and thailand these tax holidays or incentives are scheduled to expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2015 the benefit for income taxes recorded for the fiscal year ended july 2 2004 differs from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying a notional us 35 rate to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i the tax benefit related to the aforementioned tax holidays and tax incentive programs ii an additional valuation allowance recorded for us deferred tax assets and iii the reversal of the 125 million tax indemnification amount for veritas further described below our provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended june 27 2003 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying a notional us 35 rate to income before income taxes primarily due to i the tax benefit related to the aforementioned tax holidays and tax incentive programs and ii the realization of deferred tax assets that had previously been subject to a valuation allowance based on our foreign ownership structure and subject to potential future increases in our valuation allowance for us deferred tax assets we anticipate that our effective tax rate in future periods will generally be less than the us federal statutory rate dividend distributions received from our us subsidiaries may be subject to us withholding taxes when and if distributed deferred tax liabilities have not been recorded on unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as these earnings will not be subject to tax in the cayman islands or to us federal income taxes if remitted to our foreign parent holding company 

  

as of july 2 2004 we have recorded net deferred tax assets of 58 million the realization of which is primarily dependent on our ability to generate sufficient us taxable income in fiscal years 2005 and 2006 although realization is not assured management believes that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable however may increase or decrease in subsequent quarters when we reevaluate our estimates of future us and certain foreign taxable income 

  

on july 31 2001 seagate delaware and the internal revenue service filed a settlement stipulation with the united states tax court in complete settlement of the remaining disputed tax matters reflected in the statutory notice of deficiency dated june 12 1998 on march 15 2004 veritas received written notification from the internal revenue service that the congressional joint committee on taxation had completed its review and had taken no exception to the internal revenue service’s conclusions on april 6 2004 seagate delaware and the internal revenue service filed a revised settlement stipulation with the united states tax court in connection with the statutory notice of deficiency which reflected the parties’ agreement to fully resolve the remaining tax matters included in the statutory notice of deficiency on june 28 2004 the revised settlement stipulation was made final by the united states tax court and the case has been closed 

  

in the fiscal year ended july 2 2004 we recorded a 125 million income tax benefit from the reversal of 125 million of accrued income taxes relating to tax indemnification amounts due to veritas pursuant to the indemnification agreement between seagate delaware suez acquisition company and veritas the tax indemnification amount was recorded by us in connection with the purchase of the operating assets of seagate delaware and represented us tax liabilities previously accrued by seagate delaware for periods prior to the acquisition date of the operating assets as a result of the conclusion of the tax audits with no additional tax liabilities due we determined that the 125 million accrual for the tax indemnification was no longer required and it was reversed in our third fiscal quarter of 2004 

  

certain of seagate delaware’s foreign and state tax returns remain under examination by various taxing authorities the internal revenue service is currently examining our federal income tax returns for fiscal years ending in 2001 and 2002 the timing of the settlement of these examinations is uncertain we believe that adequate amounts of tax have been provided for any final assessment that may result 

  

fiscal year 2003 compared to fiscal year 2002 

  

revenue revenue for fiscal year 2003 was 6486 billion up 7 from 6087 billion in fiscal year 2002 the increase in revenue was primarily due to improved unit sales volume that was substantially offset by price erosion and a shift in mix to our desktop storage products as compared to our enterprise storage products our unit shipments increased from 55 million units in fiscal year 2002 to 68 million units in fiscal year 2003 this increase in unit shipments was in both our desktop storage products and our enterprise storage products and was due to an increase in the total available market especially for desktop storage products as well as our share of the total available market additionally we experienced strong growth in shipments to nongaming consumer electronics applications 

  

our overall average unit sales price for our rigid disc drive products was 93 94 97 and 97 for the first second third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2003 respectively average annual price erosion from fiscal year 2002 to fiscal year 2003 was approximately 14 price erosion in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2003 was the lowest we have experienced in eight years over the past few quarters including seasonally weak periods our industry has demonstrated operational discipline in managing production and inventory levels 

  

during fiscal year 2003 we continued to maintain various sales programs aimed at increasing customer demand we exercise a considerable degree of judgment in formulating the underlying estimates related to distributor inventory levels sales program participation and customer claims submittals in determining the provision for such programs during fiscal year 2003 the total provision for sales programs recorded as contrarevenue was approximately 5 of our gross revenue compared to 4 of our gross revenue for fiscal year 2002 the increase in the provision for sales programs as a percentage of our gross revenue in fiscal year 2003 as compared to fiscal year 2002 was a result of the increase in the portion of our revenue derived from sales to distributors 

  

cost of revenue cost of revenue for fiscal year 2003 was 4759 billion up 6 from 4494 billion in fiscal year 2002 gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2003 was 27 as compared with 26 for fiscal year 2002 the increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue resulted from overall costs decreasing at a higher rate than price erosion and was primarily due to improved absorption of fixed costs from increased unit sales volume ongoing cost savings as a result of our restructuring activities and our continued implementation of operational efficiencies also benefited our gross margins in addition gross margins were enhanced by improved yields for products introduced during the last half of fiscal year 2003 as well as a trend toward increased price stability 

  

product development expense product development expense decreased by 28 million or 4 for fiscal year 2003 when compared with fiscal year 2002 the decrease in product development expense from fiscal year 2002 was primarily due to the nonrecurrence of deferred compensation charges incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2002 and our sale of xiotech in november 2002 these decreases were partially offset by increased expense related to the opening of our new research facility in pittsburgh pennsylvania which included employee equipment and occupancy costs as well as several new product introductions and our development efforts in smaller than 35inch form factor rigid disc drives 

  

marketing and administrative expense marketing and administrative expense decreased by 141 million or 28 for fiscal year 2003 when compared with fiscal year 2002 the decrease in marketing and administrative expense from fiscal year 2002 was primarily due to the nonrecurrence of deferred compensation charges of 112 million incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2002 and decreases of 48 million as a result of our sale 

  

of xiotech in november 2002 and 21 million in the provision for bad debts these decreases were partially offset by increases of 20 million in salaries and related costs 14 million in information technology expense and 7 million in depreciation expense 

  

restructuring during fiscal year 2003 we recorded 19 million in restructuring charges we also reduced a restructuring accrual previously recorded by our predecessor in fiscal year 1998 by 10 million due to a change in estimated lease obligations these combined actions resulted in a net restructuring charge of 9 million in fiscal year 2003 of the 19 million 17 million was incurred in the quarter ended september 27 2002 as a result of a restructuring plan which we refer to as the fiscal year 2003 restructuring plan established to continue the alignment of our global workforce and manufacturing capacity with existing and anticipated future market requirements primarily in our far east operations the restructuring charge was comprised of employee termination costs relating to a reduction in our workforce of approximately 3750 employees we estimate that after completion of the fiscal year 2003 restructuring activities annual salary expense has been reduced by approximately 12 million excluding any savings in salary expense related to xiotech which was sold in november 2002 the fiscal year 2003 restructuring plan was substantially complete at june 27 2003 the remaining 2 million restructuring charge was incurred in the fiscal quarter ended june 27 2003 and was comprised of employee termination costs relating to a workforce reduction of approximately 686 employees in our thailand operations we estimate that after completion of these restructuring activities annual salary expense was reduced by approximately 03 million these restructuring activities were completed in july 2003 

  

net other income expense net other expense decreased 104 million or 77 for fiscal year 2003 when compared with fiscal year 2002 the decrease in net other expense from fiscal year 2002 was primarily due to decreases of 93 million related to the debt refinancing charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2002 and a 30 million reduction in interest expense in fiscal year 2003 as a result of lower average outstanding debt and lower average interest rates paid because of our debt refinancing in may 2002 these decreases were partially offset by 10 million in writedowns of our investment in a private company in fiscal year 2003 and a decrease in interest income of 9 million resulting from lower average interest rates and a lower average balance in our interest bearing accounts 

  

income taxes we recorded a provision for income taxes of 19 million for fiscal year 2003 compared to a provision for income taxes of 86 million for fiscal year 2002 we are a foreign holding company incorporated in the cayman islands with foreign and us subsidiaries that operate in multiple taxing jurisdictions as a result our worldwide operating income is either subject to varying rates of tax or exempt from tax due to tax holidays and tax incentive programs that we operate under in china malaysia singapore and thailand our provision for income taxes for fiscal year 2003 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying a notional us 35 rate to income before income taxes primarily due to i the tax benefit related to the aforementioned tax holidays and tax incentive programs and ii the realization of various deferred tax assets that had previously been subject to a valuation allowance our provision for income taxes for fiscal year 2002 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying a notional us 35 rate to income before taxes primarily due to the net effect of i the tax benefit related to the aforementioned tax holidays and tax incentive programs and ii an increase in our valuation allowance for us deferred tax assets based on our foreign ownership structure and subject to potential future increases in our valuation allowance for domestic deferred tax assets we anticipate that our effective tax rate in future periods will generally be less than the us federal statutory rate dividend distributions received from our us subsidiaries may be subject to us withholding taxes when and if distributed deferred tax liabilities have not been recorded on unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as these earnings will not be subject to tax in the cayman islands or us federal income tax if remitted to the foreign parent holding company 

  

as of june 27 2003 we have recorded net deferred tax assets of 74 million the realization of which is primarily dependent on our ability to generate sufficient us taxable income in fiscal years 2004 and 2005 although realization is not assured management believes that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax 

  

assets will be realized the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable however may increase or decrease in subsequent quarters when we reevaluate the underlying basis for our estimates of future us and certain foreign taxable income 

  

certain of our foreign tax returns for various fiscal years are under examination by taxing authorities we believe that adequate amounts of tax have been provided for any final assessment that may result from these examinations 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

the following is a discussion of our principal liquidity requirements and capital resources 

  

in may 2002 we refinanced all of our then outstanding indebtedness since that time our indebtedness has consisted of 400 million in principal amount of 8 senior notes due 2009 and senior secured credit facilities which consist of a 350 million term loan facility that has been drawn in full and a 150 million revolving credit facility under which 113 million was available for borrowing as of july 2 2004 although no borrowings have been drawn under this revolving credit facility to date we had utilized 37 million of the credit facility for outstanding letters of credit and bankers’ guarantees as of july 2 2004 the credit agreement that governs our senior secured credit facilities contains covenants that seagate technology hdd holdings our whollyowned subsidiary that operates our rigid disc drive business must satisfy in order to remain in compliance with the agreement these covenants require seagate technology hdd holdings among other things to maintain the following ratios 1 an interest expense coverage ratio for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters of at least 250 to 100 2 a fixed charge coverage ratio for any four consecutive fiscal quarters of at least 150 to 100 and 3 a net leverage ratio of not more than 150 to 100 as of the end of any fiscal quarter we are currently in compliance with all of these covenants including the financial ratios that we are required to maintain 

  

the calculated financial ratios for the quarter ended july 2 2004 are as follows 

  

   

the degree to which we are leveraged could materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for working capital capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances or other purposes and could make us more vulnerable to industry downturns and competitive pressures although we are currently not a party to any agreement or letter of intent with respect to potential investments in or acquisitions of complementary businesses products or technologies we may enter into these types of arrangements in the future which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all we will require substantial amounts of cash to fund scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness future capital expenditures and any increased working capital requirements if we are unable to meet our cash requirements out of existing cash or cash flow from operations we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain alternative financing on terms acceptable to us if at all 

  

discussion of cash flows 

  

at july 2 2004 our working capital was 1213 billion which included cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 1183 billion cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments decreased 11 million from fiscal year 2003 to fiscal year 2004 this decrease was primarily due to investments in property equipment and leasehold improvements and distributions to shareholders offset by cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from employee stock option exercises 

  

cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2004 was 635 million and consisted primarily of net income plus depreciation and amortization partially offset by a reversal of 125 million in tax indemnification amounts 

  

during fiscal year 2004 we invested approximately 605 million in property equipment and leasehold improvements the 605 million investment comprised 

  

   

   

   

   

   

during fiscal year 2003 we invested approximately 516 million in property equipment and leasehold improvements the 516 million investment comprised 

  

   

   

   

   

   

for fiscal year 2003 cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments increased 351 million this increase was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from the issuance of our common shares offset by distributions to shareholders and investments in property equipment and leasehold improvements 

  

until required for other purposes our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase our shortterm investments consist primarily of readily marketable debt securities with remaining maturities of more than 90 days at the time of purchase 

  

net cash provided by operating activities was 635 million for fiscal year 2004 882 million for fiscal year 2003 and 905 million for fiscal year 2002 net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2004 was primarily attributable to net income as adjusted for noncash expenses for depreciation and amortization and the benefit for the reversal of tax indemnification amounts net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2003 was primarily attributable to net income as adjusted for noncash expenses for depreciation and amortization and deferred compensation payments net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2002 was primarily attributable to net income as adjusted for noncash expenses for depreciation and amortization deferred income taxes deferred compensation and the writeoff of debt issuance costs and as adjusted to reclassify the cash payment for the redemption premium on the 12 1  2  senior subordinated notes to net cash used in financing activities 

  

net cash used in investing activities was 962 million for fiscal year 2004 754 million for fiscal year 2003 and 610 million for fiscal year 2002 net cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2004 was primarily attributable to expenditures for property equipment and leasehold improvements and the purchases of 

  

shortterm investments in excess of maturities net cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2003 was primarily attributable to expenditures for property equipment and leasehold improvements and the purchases of shortterm investments in excess of maturities net cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2002 was primarily attributable to expenditures for property equipment and leasehold improvements 

  

net cash provided by used in financing activities was 0 million for fiscal year 2004 9 million for fiscal year 2003 and 409 million for fiscal year 2002 net cash provided by used in financing activities for fiscal year 2004 was primarily attributable to distributions to our shareholders and principal payments on our senior credit facilities offset by cash provided from employee stock option exercises and employee stock purchases net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year 2003 was primarily attributable to cash provided from the sale of our common shares partially offset by distributions to our shareholders net cash used in financing activities for fiscal year 2002 was primarily attributable to the refinancing and overall reduction of all of our outstanding indebtedness payment of distributions to our shareholders and payment of the redemption premium on the 12 1  2  senior subordinated notes 

  

liquidity sources and cash requirements and commitments 

  

on january 29 2004 our board of directors amended our quarterly dividend policy and pursuant to our amended dividend policy we are paying and expect to continue to pay our shareholders a quarterly distribution of up to 006 per share 024 annually so long as the aggregate amount of the distributions does not exceed 50 of our cumulative consolidated net income plus 100 of net cash proceeds received from the issuance of capital for the period beginning june 30 2001 and ending the most recent fiscal quarter for which financial statements are internally available our ability to continue to pay quarterly distributions will be subject to among other things general business conditions within the rigid disc drive industry our financial results the impact of paying distributions on our credit ratings and legal and contractual restrictions on the payment of distributions by our subsidiaries to us or by us to our shareholders including restrictions imposed by the covenants contained in the indenture governing our senior notes currently the most significant restriction on our ability to pay dividends is under the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities which limits annual distributions to 150 million on july 19 2004 our board of directors declared a quarterly distribution of 006 per share to be paid on or before august 20 2004 to our shareholders of record as of august 6 2004 

  

our principal sources of liquidity as of july 2 2004 consisted of 1 1183 billion in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments 2 a 150 million revolving credit facility of which 37 million had been used for outstanding letters of credit and bankers’ guarantees as of july 2 2004 and 3 cash we expect to generate from operations during this fiscal year 

  

since the closing of the november 2000 transactions our principal liquidity requirements have been to service our debt and meet our working capital research and development and capital expenditure needs in addition in the second half of fiscal year 2002 and through fiscal years 2003 and 2004 we made distributions to our shareholders 

  

we believe that our sources of cash will be sufficient to fund our operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months our ability to fund these requirements and comply with the financial covenants under our debt agreements will depend on our future operations performance and cash flow and is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial business and other factors some of which are beyond our control in addition as part of our strategy we intend to selectively pursue strategic alliances acquisitions and investments that are complementary to our business any material future acquisitions alliances or investments will likely require additional capital we cannot assure you that additional funds from available sources will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 

  

our contractual cash obligations and commitments as of july 2 2004 have been summarized in the table below in millions 

  

    

   

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

as of july 2 2004 we did not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of regulation sk 

  

equity plan compensation information 

  

the following table sets forth for each of our existing equity compensation plans the number of common shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding options warrants and rights the weightedaverage exercise price of the outstanding options warrants and rights and the number of common shares remaining available for issuance under such plans as of the end of fiscal year 2004 

  

    

   

   

   

critical accounting policies 

  

the methods estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements the sec has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are highly uncertain at the time of estimation based on this definition our most critical policies include establishment of distributor sales program accruals establishment of warranty accruals and valuation of deferred tax assets below we discuss these policies further as well as the estimates and judgments involved we also have other key accounting policies and accounting estimates relating to uncollectible customer accounts and valuation of inventory we believe that these other accounting policies and other accounting estimates either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective or it is less likely that they would have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period 

  

establishment of sales program accruals we establish certain distributor and oem sales programs aimed at increasing customer demand these programs are typically related to a distributor’s level of sales order size advertising or point of sale activity or an oem’s level of sale activity or agreed upon rebate programs we provide for these obligations at the time that revenue is recorded based on estimated requirements these estimates are based on various factors including estimated future price erosion distributor sellthrough levels program participation customer claim submittals and sales returns during periods in which our distributors’ inventories of our products are at higher than historical levels such as the second fiscal quarter ended january 2 2004 our estimates upon which our recorded contrarevenue is based are subject to a greater degree of subjectivity and the potential for actual results to vary is accordingly higher significant actual variations in any of the factors upon which we base our estimates could have a material effect on our operating results in addition our failure to accurately predict the level of future sales returns by our distribution customers could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

we made changes to our distributor sales programs commencing with our third fiscal quarter of 2004 that simplified the calculation of sales incentive allowances although these changes have the potential to reduce the level of estimation required in establishing sales program accruals in future periods no assurance can be given that this will be the case particularly as we implement our new programs 

  

establishment of warranty accruals we estimate probable product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized we generally warrant our products for a period of one to five years we use estimated repair or replacement costs and use statistical modeling to estimate product return rates in order to determine our warranty obligation we exercise judgment in determining the underlying estimates our judgment is subject to a greater degree of subjectivity with respect to newly introduced products because of a lack of past experience with those products upon which to base our estimates should actual experience in any future period differ significantly from our estimates our future results of operations could be materially affected the actual results with regard to warranty expenditures could have a material adverse effect on us if the actual rate of unit failure is greater than 

  

what we used in estimating the warranty expense accrual on july 26 2004 we announced the introduction of our fiveyear warranty on products shipped into our distribution and retail channels and we expect that the impact of this change will increase our future warranty costs 

  

valuation of deferred tax assets the recording of our deferred tax assets each period depends primarily on our ability to generate current and future taxable income in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions each period we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and we adjust the valuation allowance so that we record net deferred tax assets only to the extent that we conclude it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

in april 2003 the fasb issued sfas no 149 “amendment of statement 133 on derivative instruments and hedging activities” “sfas 149” which amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” sfas 149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june 30 2003 except for the provisions that were cleared by the fasb in prior pronouncements the adoption of sfas 149 did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 

  

in may 2003 the fasb issued sfas no 150 “accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity” “sfas 150” this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures in its statement of financial position certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity in accordance with the standard financial instruments that embody obligations for the issuer are required to be classified as liabilities this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may 31 2003 and was effective in our fiscal quarter ended october 3 2003 the adoption of sfas 150 did not have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position 

  

in december 2003 the fasb issued a revision to fasb statement no 132 “employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits” “sfas 132r” this statement establishes standards that require companies to provide more details about their plan assets benefit obligations cash flows benefit costs and other relevant information in addition to expanded annual disclosures companies are required to report the various elements of pension and other postretirement benefit costs on a quarterly basis this statement is effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2003 and was effective for our fiscal quarter ended april 2 2004 because the revisions only effect disclosure requirements the adoption of sfas 132r did not have an impact on our results of operations or financial position 

  

risk factors 

  

risks related to our business 

  

competition—our industry is highly competitive and our products have experienced significant price erosion and market share variability 

  

even during periods when demand is stable the rigid disc drive industry is intensely competitive and vendors typically experience substantial price erosion over the life of a product our competitors have historically offered existing products at lower prices as part of a strategy to gain or retain market share and customers and we expect these practices to continue we may need to reduce our prices to retain our market share which could adversely affect our results of operations based on our recent experience in the industry with respect to new product introductions we believe that the rate of increase in areal density or the storage capacity per square inch on a disc is slowing from its previous levels this trend may contribute to increased average price erosion to the extent that historical price erosion patterns continue product life cycles may lengthen our competitors may have more time to enter the market for a particular product and we may be unable to offset these factors with new product introductions at higher average prices a second trend that may contribute to increased average price erosion is the growth of sales to distributors that serve producers of nonbranded products in the personal storage sector these customers generally have limited product qualification programs which increases the number of competing products available to satisfy their demand as a result purchasing decisions for these customers are based largely on price and terms any increase in our average price erosion would have an adverse effect on our result of operations 

  

moreover a significant portion of our success historically has been a result of increasing our market share at the expense of our competitors however in the first fiscal quarter of 2004 our market share for our enterprise products was negatively affected by our customers’ diversifying their sources of supply as the slowing areal density curve has resulted in longer product cycles and more time for our competitors to enter the market for particular products additionally in the third fiscal quarter of 2004 our market share for notebook drive products was negatively affected by an oversupply condition in our customers’ supply chain any significant further decline in our market share would adversely affect our results of operations 

  

principal competitors—we compete with both captive manufacturers who do not depend solely on sales of rigid disc drives to maintain their profitability and independent manufacturers whose primary focus is producing technologically advanced rigid disc drives 

  

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience intense competition from a number of domestic and foreign companies including other independent rigid disc drive manufacturers and large captive manufacturers such as 

  

   

the term “independent” in this context refers to manufacturers that primarily produce rigid disc drives as a standalone product and the term “captive” refers to rigid disc drive manufacturers who themselves or through affiliated entities produce complete computer or other systems that contain rigid disc drives or other information storage products captive manufacturers are formidable competitors because they have the ability to determine pricing for complete systems without regard to the margins on individual components because components other than rigid disc drives generally contribute a greater portion of the operating margin on a complete computer system than do rigid disc drives captive manufacturers do not necessarily need to realize a profit on the rigid disc drives included in a computer system and as a result may be willing to sell rigid disc drives to third parties at very low margins many captive manufacturers are also formidable competitors because they have more 

  

substantial resources than we do in addition hitachi global storage technologies together with affiliated entities and samsung electronics incorporated also sell other products to our customers including critical components like flash memory applicationspecific integrated circuits or asics and flat panel displays and may be willing to sell their disc drives at a lower margin to advance their overall business strategy this may improve their ability to compete with us to the extent we are not successful competing with captive or independent rigid disc drive manufacturers our results of operations will be adversely affected 

  

in addition in response to customer demand for highquality highvolume and lowcost rigid disc drives manufacturers of rigid disc drives have had to develop large in some cases global production facilities with highly developed technological capabilities and internal controls the development of large production facilities and industry consolidation can contribute to the intensification of competition we also face indirect competition from present and potential customers who evaluate from time to time whether to manufacture their own rigid disc drives or other information storage products 

  

volatility of quarterly results—our quarterly operating results fluctuate significantly from period to period and this may cause our stock price to decline 

  

in the past our quarterly revenue and operating results fluctuated significantly from period to period we expect this fluctuation to continue for a variety of reasons including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

as a result we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful and that these comparisons may not be an accurate indicator of our future performance our operating results in one or more future quarters may fail to meet the expectations of investment research analysts or investors which could cause an immediate and significant decline in the trading price of our common shares 

  

new product offerings—market acceptance of new product introductions cannot be accurately predicted and our results of operations will suffer if there is less demand for our new products than is anticipated 

  

we are continually developing new products in the hope that we will be able to introduce technologically advanced rigid disc drives into the marketplace ahead of our competitors 

  

we recently announced 12 new rigid disc drive products which will be introduced in the current fiscal year many of which will address rigid disc drive applications for which we currently have no product offerings some of these new products introduce new form factors such as our first 1inch form factor rigid disc drive and our first 25inch form factor rigid disc drive for enterprise applications some of these new products also introduce higher levels of areal density than our existing products we believe that our nearterm financial results including our ability to achieve the results included in publicly announced forecasts will depend heavily on the successful introduction and customer acceptance of these new products 

  

the success of our new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors including market acceptance our ability to manage the risks associated with product transitions the effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand and the risk that our new products will have quality problems or other defects in the early stages of introduction that were not anticipated in the design of those products accordingly we cannot accurately determine the ultimate effect that our new products will have on our sales or results of operations 

  

in addition the success of our new product introductions is dependent upon our ability to qualify as a primary source of supply with our oem customers in order for our products to be considered by our customers for qualification we must be among the leaders in timetomarket with those new products once a product is accepted for qualification testing any failure or delay in the qualification process or a requirement that we requalify can result in our losing sales to that customer until new products are introduced the limited number of highvolume oems magnifies the effect of missing a product qualification opportunity these risks are further magnified because we expect competitive pressures to result in declining sales and declining gross margins on our current generation products we cannot assure you that we will be among the leaders in timetomarket with new products or that we will be able to successfully qualify new products with our customers in the future 

  

smaller form factor rigid disc drives—if we do not continue to successfully market smaller form factor rigid disc drives our business may suffer 

  

increases in sales of notebook computers and in areal density are resulting in a shift to smaller form factor rigid disc drives for an expanding number of applications including personal computers enterprise storage applications and consumer electronic devices many of these applications have typically used rigid disc drives with a 35inch form factor which we currently manufacture notebook computers typically use 25inch form factor rigid disc drives we initiated volume shipments of our momentus notebook disc drive to a number of oems in the second fiscal quarter of 2004 these shipments materially contributed to our results of operations in the second fiscal quarter however our recently introduced products only address a limited portion of the existing notebook market and in our third fiscal quarter of 2004 ended april 2 2004 an oversupply of notebook disc drives in the supply chain led to a significant reduction in our shipments of momentus which adversely impacted our results of operations we recently announced our first 1inch form factor rigid disc drive additional capacity models of our momentus notebook disc drive and a 25inch form factor disc drive for enterprise storage applications these products are scheduled for introduction during fiscal year 2005 if we do not successfully introduce these products or if we do not suitably adapt our technology and product offerings to successfully develop and introduce additional smaller form factor rigid disc drives customers may decrease the amounts of our products that they purchase which would adversely affect our results of operations 

  

importance of reducing operating costs—if we do not reduce our operating expenses we will not be able to compete effectively in our industry 

  

our strategy involves to a substantial degree increasing revenue while at the same time reducing operating expenses in this regard we have engaged in ongoing companywide manufacturing efficiency activities intended to increase productivity and reduce costs these activities have included closures and transfers of facilities significant personnel reductions and efforts to increase automation for example in our fourth fiscal quarter of 2004 we undertook significant restructuring activities to reduce the costs of our operations and we 

  

continue to look at opportunities for further cost reductions which may result in additional restructuring activities in the future we cannot assure you that our efforts will result in the increased profitability cost savings or other benefits that we expect moreover the reduction of personnel and closure of facilities may adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in required volumes to meet customer demand and may result in other disruptions that affect our products and customer service in addition the transfer of manufacturing capacity of a product to a different facility frequently requires qualification of the new facility by some of our oem customers we cannot assure you that these activities and transfers will be implemented on a costeffective basis without delays or disruption in our production and without adversely affecting our customer relationships and results of operations 

  

industry demand—changes in demand for computer systems and storage subsystems has caused and may cause in the future a decline in demand for our products 

  

our rigid disc drives are components in computers computer systems and storage subsystems and consumer electronic devices the demand for these products has been volatile in a weak economy consumer spending tends to decline and retail demand for pcs and consumer electronic devices tends to decrease as does enterprise demand for computer systems and storage subsystems during economic slowdowns such as the one that began in 2001 demand for rigid disc drives particularly in the enterprise sector was adversely impacted as a result of the weakened economy and because enterprises shifted their focus from making new equipment purchases to more efficiently using their existing information technology infrastructure through among other things adopting new storage architectures unexpected slowdowns in demand for computer systems and storage subsystems generally cause sharp declines in demand for rigid disc drive products 

  

additional causes of declines in demand for our products in the past have included announcements or introductions of major operating system or semiconductor improvements or changes in consumer preferences such as the shift from desktop to notebook computers we believe these announcements and introductions have from time to time caused consumers to defer their purchases and made inventory obsolete whenever an oversupply of rigid disc drives causes participants in our industry to have higher than anticipated inventory levels we experience even more intense price competition from other rigid disc drive manufacturers than usual 

  

seasonality—because we experience seasonality in the sales of our products our results of operations will generally be adversely impacted during our fourth fiscal quarter 

  

because sales of computer systems storage subsystems and consumer electronics tend to be seasonal we expect to continue to experience seasonality in our business as we respond to variations in our customers’ demand for rigid disc drives in particular we anticipate that sales of our products will continue to be lower during our fourth fiscal quarter than the rest of the year in the desktop computer notebook computer and consumer electronics sectors of our business this seasonality is partially attributable to our customers’ increased sales of pcs and consumer electronics during the winter holiday season in the enterprise sector of our business our sales are seasonal because of the capital budgeting and purchasing cycles of our end users because our working capital needs peak during periods in which we are increasing production in anticipation of orders that have not yet been received our operating results will fluctuate seasonally even if the forecasted demand for our products proves accurate furthermore it is difficult for us to evaluate the degree to which this seasonality may affect our business in future periods because our overall growth may have reduced the impact of this seasonality in recent periods in addition the pattern of seasonal changes in demand may change for instance we believe demand for our products used in consumer electronics may be peaking in our first fiscal quarter which is earlier than in the past 

  

difficulty in predicting quarterly demand—if we fail to predict demand accurately for our products in any quarter we may not be able to recapture the cost of our investments 

  

the rigid disc drive industry operates on quarterly purchasing cycles with much of the order flow in any given quarter coming at the end of that quarter our manufacturing process requires us to make significant 

  

productspecific investments in inventory in each quarter for that quarter’s production because we typically receive the bulk of our orders late in a quarter after we have made our investments there is a risk that our orders will not be sufficient to allow us to recapture the costs of our investment before the products resulting from that investment have become obsolete we cannot assure you that we will be able to accurately predict demand in the future 

  

other factors that may negatively impact our ability to recapture the cost of investments in any given quarter include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

dependence on distributors—we are dependent on sales to distributors which may increase price erosion and the volatility of our sales 

  

a substantial portion of our sales has been to distributors of desktop disc drive products product qualification programs in this distribution channel are limited which increases the number of competing products that are available to satisfy demand particularly in times of lengthening product cycles as a result purchasing decisions in this channel are based largely on price terms and product availability sales volumes through this channel are also less predictable and subject to greater volatility than sales to our oem customers recently a number of disc drive manufacturers independently launched initiatives to improve the stability of the distribution channel particularly with respect to the purchasing behavior of these distributors while other disc drive manufacturers have not these actions have further increased the uncertainty as to demand within this market segment to the extent that distributors reduce their purchases of our products or prices decline significantly in the distribution channel our results of operations would be adversely affected 

  

longer product life cycles—lengthening of product life cycles can make planning product transitions difficult and may reduce the favorable impact of new product transitions 

  

in contrast to historical trends based on our recent experience in the industry with respect to new product introductions we believe that the current rate of increase in areal density is slowing from the rate of the last several years we believe that this slowdown in the rate of increase in areal density will continue until a significant advance in technology for the electronic storage of data such as perpendicular recording technology becomes commercially available 

  

when the rate of increase in areal density slows it may contribute to increased average price erosion to the extent historical price erosion patterns continue a limitation in our ability to introduce new products at higher prices and lengthened product life cycles which permits competitors more time to enter the market for a particular type of disc drive in addition the lengthening of product life cycles can make planning product transitions more difficult to the extent that we prematurely discontinue a product or do not timely introduce new products our operating results may be adversely affected 

  

because the rate of growth in areal density is slowing the favorable impact of new product introductions on our results of operations may be minimized historically the introduction of new products generally has had a favorable impact on our results of operations both because the new products are introduced at higher prices than existing competitive offerings and because advances in areal density technology have enabled lower manufacturing costs through a reduction in components such as readwrite heads and rigid discs however in contrast to when the rate of growth in areal density is increasing a slowing growth rate in areal density can limit the cost benefits of new products because it is technologically more difficult to reduce the number of readwrite heads and rigid discs in a particular drive in addition given the environment of intense price competition in the absence of significant capacity or reliability increases it is difficult to obtain higher prices for new products 

  

industry consolidation—consolidation among captive manufacturers may serve to increase their resources and improve their access to customers thereby making them more formidable competitors 

  

consolidation among captive manufacturers may provide them with competitive advantages over independent manufacturers including us for example in december 2002 ibm merged its disc drive business with the disc drive business of hitachi through the formation of hitachi global storage technologies a separate company hitachi is the controlling shareholder of hitachi global storage technologies and is expected to assume full ownership at the end of 2005 as a part of this transaction each of ibm and hitachi agreed to multiyear supply commitments with the new company because ibm is one of our most significant customers and hitachi is one of our most significant competitors there is a significant risk that ibm will decrease the number of rigid disc drives purchased from us and increase the number purchased from the new company moreover economies of scale and the combination of the two companies’ technological capabilities particularly in the enterprise sector of our industry could make the new company a more formidable competitor than ibm or hitachi operating alone 

  

importance of timetomarket—our operating results may depend on our being among the firsttomarket and achieving sufficient production volume with our new products 

  

to achieve consistent success with our oem customers it is important that we be an early provider of new types of rigid disc drives featuring leading highquality technology historically our operating results have substantially depended upon our ability to be among the firsttomarket with new product offerings however during a period of slowing areal density growth such as we are in now the importance of timetomarket may be less critical our market share and operating results in the future may be adversely affected particularly if the areal density curve resumes its historical rate of growth if we fail to 

  

   

   

   

   

if delivery of our products is delayed our oem customers may use our competitors’ products to meet their production requirements if the delay of our products causes delivery of those oems’ computer systems into which our products are integrated to be delayed consumers and businesses may purchase comparable products from the oems’ competitors 

  

moreover we face the related risk that consumers and businesses may wait to make their purchases if they want to buy a new product that has been shipped or announced but not yet released if this were to occur we may be unable to sell our existing inventory of products that may have become less efficient and cost effective compared to new products as a result even if we are among the firsttomarket with a given product subsequent introductions or announcements by our competitors of new products could cause us to lose revenue and not achieve a positive return on our investment in existing products and inventory 

  

new product development and technological change—if we do not develop products in time to keep pace with technological changes our operating results will be adversely affected 

  

our customers have demanded new generations of rigid disc drive products as advances in computer hardware and software have created the need for improved storage products with features such as increased storage capacity improved performance and reliability of smaller form factors we and our competitors have developed improved products and we will need to continue to do so in the future for fiscal years 2004 2003 and 2002 we had product development expenses of 666 million 670 million and 698 million respectively we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully complete the design or introduction of new products in a timely manner that we will be able to manufacture new products in sufficient volumes with acceptable manufacturing yields that we will be able to successfully market these new products or that these products will perform to specifications on a longterm basis in addition the impact of slowing areal density growth may adversely impact our ability to be successful 

  

when we develop new products with higher capacity and more advanced technology our operating results may decline because the increased difficulty and complexity associated with producing these products increases the likelihood of reliability quality or operability problems if our products suffer increases in failures are of low quality or are not reliable customers may reduce their purchases of our products and our manufacturing rework and scrap costs and service and warranty costs may increase in addition a decline in the reliability of our products may make us less competitive as compared with other rigid disc drive manufacturers 

  

impact of technological change—increases in the areal density of disc drives may outpace customers’ demand for storage capacity 

  

the rate of increase in areal density or storage capacity per square inch on a disc may be greater than the increase in our customers’ demand for aggregate storage capacity as a result our customers’ storage capacity needs may be satisfied with fewer rigid disc drives these factors could decrease our sales especially when combined with continued price erosion which could adversely affect our results of operations 

  

changes in information storage products—future changes in the nature of information storage products may reduce demand for traditional rigid disc drive products 

  

we expect that in the future new personal computing devices and products will be developed some of which such as internet appliances may not contain a rigid disc drive while we are investing development resources in designing information storage products for new applications it is too early to assess the impact of these new applications on future demand for rigid disc drive products we cannot assure you that we will be successful in developing other information storage products in addition there are currently no widely accepted standards in various technical areas that may be important to the future of our business including the developing sector of intelligent storage solutions products using alternative technologies such as semiconductor memory optical storage and other storage technologies could become a significant source of competition to particular applications of our products 

  

for example semiconductor memory is much faster than rigid disc drives but currently is volatile in that it is subject to loss of data in the event of power failure and is much more costly than rigid disc drive technologies flash eeprom a nonvolatile semiconductor memory is currently much more costly than rigid disc drive 

  

technologies and while it has higher read performance than rigid disc drives it has lower write performance flash eeprom could become competitive in the near future for applications requiring less storage capacity than that required in traditional markets for our products 

  

high fixed costs—our vertical integration strategy entails a high level of fixed costs 

  

our vertical integration strategy entails a high level of fixed costs and requires a high volume of production and sales to be successful during periods of decreased production these high fixed costs have had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition for example in 1998 our predecessor experienced a significant decrease in the demand for its products and because our predecessor was unable to adequately reduce its costs to offset this decrease in revenue its gross and operating margins suffered in addition a strategy of vertical integration has in the past and could in the future delay our ability to introduce products containing marketleading technology because we may not have developed the technology and source of components for our products and do not have access to external sources of supply without incurring substantial costs 

  

research and development expenses represent a significant portion of our fixed costs as part of our vertical integration strategy we explore a broad range of ways to improve rigid disc drives as well as possible alternatives to rigid disc drives for storing and retrieving electronic data if we fail to develop new technologies in a timely manner and our competitors succeed in doing so our ability to sell our products could be significantly diminished conversely if we over invest in technologies that can never be profitably manufactured and marketed our results of operations could suffer by way of example we have incurred expenses in exploring new technologies for storing electronic data including perpendicular recording technology which involves a different orientation for the magnetic field than is currently used in rigid disc drives and heat assisted magnetic recording technology which uses heat generated by a laser to improve storage capacity we believe these new technologies could significantly improve the storage capacity of rigid disc drives over the long term to date we have not yet developed a commercial product based on these technologies furthermore based on our recent experience in the industry with respect to new product introductions we believe that the rate of increase of areal density is slowing as compared to its previous levels which has lengthened the life cycles of existing products and may further postpone returns on our investments in new technologies if we have invested too much in new technologies our results of operations could be adversely affected in addition as we replace our existing assets with new higher cost assets we expect that our depreciation expense will increase which will contribute to our high level of fixed costs and reduce our earnings this could cause the market price of our common shares to decline 

  

dependence on supply of equipment and components—if we experience shortages or delays in the receipt of critical equipment or components necessary to manufacture our products we may suffer lower operating margins production delays and other material adverse effects 

  

the cost quality and availability of some equipment components and raw materials used to manufacture rigid disc drives and other information storage products are critical to the successful manufacture of these products the equipment we use to manufacture our products is frequently custom made and comes from a few suppliers particularly important components include readwrite heads recording media applicationspecific integrated circuits or asics spindle motors and printed circuit boards we rely on sole suppliers and a limited number of suppliers for some of these components including the readwrite heads and recording media that we do not manufacture asics spindle motors and printed circuit boards in the past we have experienced increased costs and production delays when we were unable to obtain the necessary equipment or sufficient quantities of some components andor have been forced to pay higher prices for some components or raw materials such as precious metals that were in short supply in the industry in general 

  

due to the weakened economy in general and in the technology sector of the economy in particular the rigid disc drive industry has experienced economic pressure which has resulted in consolidation among component 

  

manufacturers and may result in some component manufacturers exiting the industry or not making sufficient investments in research to develop new components in addition the recent increases in demand for our mobile computing products such as notebook computers could lead to shortages in the components used in smaller form factor rigid disc drives such as the glass substrates used to make the recording media for such drives these events could affect our ability to obtain critical components for our products including our recently introduced line of products for notebook computers which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our prospects and results of operations 

  

if there is a shortage of or delay in supplying us with critical components then 

  

   

   

   

   

we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain critical components in a timely and economic manner or at all 

  

dependence on key customers—we may be adversely affected by the loss of or reduced delayed or cancelled purchases by one or more of our larger customers 

  

for fiscal years 2004 2003 and 2002 our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 62 63 and 63 respectively of our rigid disc drive revenue hewlettpackard accounted for approximately 19 and 18 of our rigid disc drive revenue for fiscal years 2004 and 2003 respectively sales to hewlettpackard and compaq together accounted for approximately 20 of our rigid disc drive revenue in fiscal year 2002 if any of our key customers were to significantly reduce their purchases from us our results of operations would be adversely affected while sales to major customers may vary from period to period a major customer that permanently discontinues or significantly reduces its relationship with us could be difficult to replace in line with industry practice new customers usually require that we pass a lengthy and rigorous qualification process at the customer’s cost accordingly it may be difficult for us to attract new major customers 

  

customer concentration—consolidation among our customers could cause sales of our products to decline 

  

mergers acquisitions consolidations or other significant transactions involving our customers generally entail risks to our business for example ibm which is one of our key customers merged its disc drive business with the disc drive business of hitachi through the formation of a new company with which ibm has entered into a multiyear supply agreement as a result ibm may decrease its purchases from us in favor of this new company if a significant transaction involving any of our key customers results in the loss of or reduction in purchases by these key customers it could have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and prospects 

  

oem purchase agreements—our oem customers are not obligated to purchase our products 

  

typically our oem purchase agreements permit oems to cancel orders and reschedule delivery dates without significant penalties in the past orders from many of our oems were cancelled and delivery schedules were delayed as a result of changes in the requirements of the oems’ customers these order cancellations and 

  

delays in delivery schedules have had a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the past and may do so again in the future our oems and distributors typically furnish us with nonbinding indications of their near term requirements with product deliveries based on weekly confirmations if actual orders from distributors and oems decrease from their nonbinding forecasts these variances could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and prospects 

  

economic risks associated with international operations—our international operations subject us to risks related to currency exchange fluctuations longer payment cycles for sales in foreign countries seasonality and disruptions in foreign markets tariffs and duties price controls potential adverse tax consequences increased costs our customers’ credit and access to capital and healthrelated risks 

  

we have significant operations in foreign countries including manufacturing facilities sales personnel and customer support operations for fiscal years 2004 2003 and 2002 approximately 30 31 and 31 respectively of our rigid disc drive revenue were from sales to customers located in europe and approximately 40 35 and 30 respectively were from sales to customers located in the far east we have manufacturing facilities in china malaysia northern ireland singapore and thailand in addition to those in the united states a substantial portion of our desktop rigid disc drive assembly occurs in our facility in china 

  

our international operations are subject to economic risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries including the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

political risks associated with international operations—our international operations subject us to risks related to political unrest and terrorism 

  

we have manufacturing facilities in parts of the world that periodically experience political unrest this could disrupt our ability to manufacture important components as well as cause interruptions andor delays in our ability to ship components to other locations for continued manufacture and assembly any such delays or interruptions could result in delays in our ability to fill orders and have an adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition us and international responses to the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 the ongoing hostilities in afghanistan and iraq and the risk of hostilities with north korea could exacerbate these risks 

  

legal and operational risks associated with international operations—our international operations subject us to risks related to staffing and management legal and regulatory requirements and the protection of intellectual property 

  

operating outside of the united states creates difficulties associated with staffing and managing our international manufacturing facilities complying with local legal and regulatory requirements and protecting our intellectual property we cannot assure you that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with applicable customs currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which we may be subject we also cannot assure you that these laws will not be modified 

  

conflicts of interest of our directors and officers—our directors and executive officers may have conflicts of interest because of their ownership of capital stock of and their employment with our parent company and our affiliates 

  

many of our directors and executive officers hold ordinary shares of our parent company new sac ownership of the capital stock of our parent company by our directors and officers could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest when our directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for us and for new sac 

  

some of our directors also serve on the board of new sac several of our executive officers also serve as officers andor directors of new sac as well as of other affiliates of ours in view of these overlapping relationships conflicts of interest may exist or arise with respect to existing and future business dealings including the relative commitment of time and energy by our directors and officers to us and to our parent company and affiliates potential acquisitions of businesses or properties and other business opportunities the issuance of additional securities the election of new or additional directors and the payment of distributions by us we cannot assure you that any conflicts of interest will be resolved in our favor 

  

risks associated with future acquisitions—we may not be able to identify suitable strategic alliance acquisition or investment opportunities or successfully acquire and integrate companies that provide complementary products or technologies 

  

our growth strategy may involve pursuing strategic alliances with and making acquisitions of or investments in other companies that are complementary to our business there is substantial competition for attractive strategic alliance acquisition and investment candidates we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition investment or strategic partnership candidates even if we were able to identify them we cannot assure you that we will be able to partner with acquire or invest in suitable candidates or integrate acquired technologies or operations successfully into our existing technologies and operations our ability to finance 

  

potential acquisitions will be limited by our high degree of leverage the covenants contained in the indenture that governs our outstanding 8 senior notes the credit agreement that governs our senior secured credit facilities and any agreements governing any other debt we may incur 

  

if we are successful in acquiring other companies these acquisitions may have an adverse effect on our operating results particularly while the operations of the acquired business are being integrated it is also likely that integration of acquired companies would lead to the loss of key employees from those companies or the loss of customers of those companies in addition the integration of any acquired companies would require substantial attention from our senior management which may limit the amount of time available to be devoted to our daytoday operations or to the execution of our strategy furthermore the expansion of our business involves the risk that we might not manage our growth effectively that we would incur additional debt to finance these acquisitions or investments and that we would incur substantial charges relating to the writeoff of inprocess research and development similar to that which we incurred in connection with several of our prior acquisitions each of these items could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 

  

potential loss of licensed technology—the closing of the november 2000 transactions may have triggered change of control or antiassignment provisions in some of our license agreements which could result in a loss of our right to use licensed technology 

  

we have a number of crosslicenses with third parties that enable us to manufacture our products free from any infringement claims that might otherwise be made by these third parties against us a number of these licenses contain change of control or antiassignment provisions we have taken steps to transfer these licenses in connection with the closing of the november 2000 transactions however we cannot assure you that these transfers will not be challenged for example papst licensing gmbh ibm and hitachi initially took the position that their license agreements did not transfer to our new business entities subsequently we entered into new license agreements with ibm and hitachi in december 2001 in september 2002 we settled a broader dispute with papst that also resolved the claim by papst that its license agreement was not properly transferred 

  

we received a letter dated november 20 2002 from readrite corporation asserting that we do not currently have a license to its patented technology and that our rigid disc drive products infringe at least two of its patents we have since received additional letters from readrite corporation making the same claims seagate delaware entered into a patent cross license agreement dated december 31 1994 which covered the two patents referenced in the november 20 2002 letter as well as other intellectual property of readrite corporation prior to the november 20 2002 letter readrite corporation had not responded to our efforts to confirm that under the patent cross license agreement we were entitled to a new license agreement in our own name and on materially the same terms as the 1994 agreement in order to clarify the parties’ rights under the patent cross license agreement we filed a declaratory judgment action on may 7 2003 in the superior court of california county of santa clara seeking a declaration that we are entitled to a crosslicense effective as of november 22 2000 under terms substantially identical to those contained in the patent cross license agreement on june 11 2003 readrite corporation answered the complaint putting forward a general denial and asserting various affirmative defenses on june 17 2003 readrite corporation filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under chapter 7 of the us bankruptcy code upon notice our declaratory judgment action has been stayed on july 23 2003 the us bankruptcy court approved western digital corporation’s bid to acquire the assets of readrite corporation including the intellectual property that was the subject of readrite’s dispute with us in a transaction that closed on july 31 2003 we objected to western digital’s assumption of the patent crosslicense agreement on november 14 2003 the bankruptcy trustee made a motion to assume or reject certain readrite executory contracts rejecting the patent crosslicense agreement we have given notice of our election to retain the benefits of the patent crosslicense agreement to the extent permitted by section 365n of the us bankruptcy code 

  

to the extent that third party crosslicenses including the patent cross license agreement dated december 31 1994 between readrite corporation and seagate delaware are deemed not to have been properly assigned to us in the november 2000 transactions our inability to either obtain new licenses or transfer existing 

  

licenses could result in delays in product development or prevent us from selling our products until equivalent substitute technology can be identified licensed andor integrated or until we are able to substantially engineer our products to avoid infringing the rights of third parties we might not be able to renegotiate agreements be able to obtain necessary licenses in a timely manner on acceptable terms or at all or be able to reengineer our products successfully moreover the loss of or inability to extend any of these licenses would increase the risk of infringement claims being made against us which claims could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

risk of intellectual property litigation—our products may infringe the intellectual property rights of others which may cause us to incur unexpected costs or prevent us from selling our products 

  

we cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of others historically patent applications in the united states and some foreign countries have not been publicly disclosed until the patent is issued and we may not be aware of currently filed patent applications that relate to our products or technology if patents are later issued on these applications we may be liable for infringement we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims including claims of alleged infringement of the patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties by us or our licensees in connection with their use of our products we are currently subject to a suit by convolve inc and the massachusetts institute of technology and a suit pending in nanjing china in addition as noted above readrite corporation in a letter dated november 20 2002 and in correspondence since that date asserted that we do not currently have a license to readrite corporation patented technology and that our rigid disc drive products infringe at least two readrite corporation patents 

  

intellectual property litigation is expensive and timeconsuming regardless of the merits of any claim and could divert our management’s attention from operating our business in addition intellectual property lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties due to the complexity of the technical issues involved and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in defending ourselves against intellectual property claims moreover software patent litigation has increased due to the current uncertainty of the law and the increasing competition and overlap of product functionality in the field if we were to discover that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of others we would need to obtain licenses from these parties or substantially reengineer our products in order to avoid infringement we might not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms or at all or be able to reengineer our products successfully moreover if we are sued for infringement and lose the suit we could be required to pay substantial damages andor be enjoined from using or selling the infringing products or technology any of the foregoing could cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling our products 

  

dependence on intellectual property—if our intellectual property and other proprietary information were copied or independently developed by competitors our operating results would be negatively affected 

  

our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to protect and preserve the proprietary aspects of our technology however we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our technology without our authorization particularly in those countries where the laws do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states or protect us from independently developing or acquiring technology that is similar to ours for example in its bankruptcy proceedings under chapter 7 of the us bankruptcy code readrite corporation’s patents and other intellectual property rights were sold to western digital corporation who will use this intellectual property to compete against us the use of our technology or similar technology by others could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business if it became necessary for us to resort to litigation to protect these rights any proceedings could be burdensome and costly and we may not prevail 

  

limitations on patent protection—our issued and pending patents may not adequately protect our intellectual property or provide us with any competitive advantage 

  

although we have numerous us and foreign patents and numerous pending patents that relate to our technology we cannot assure you that any patents issued or pending will provide us with any competitive 

  

advantage or will not be challenged by third parties moreover our competitors may already have applied for patents that once issued will prevail over our patent rights or otherwise limit our ability to sell our products in the united states or abroad our competitors also may attempt to design around our patents or copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology with respect to our pending patent applications we may not be successful in securing patents for these claims our failure to secure these patents may limit our ability to protect the intellectual property rights that these applications were intended to cover 

  

disclosure of our proprietary technology—confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements may not adequately protect our proprietary technology or trade secrets 

  

we have entered into confidentiality agreements with our employees and nondisclosure agreements with customers suppliers and potential strategic partners among others if any party to these agreements were to violate their agreement with us and disclose our proprietary technology to a third party we may be unable to prevent the third party from using this information because a significant portion of our proprietary technology consists of specialized knowledge and technical expertise developed by our employees we have a program in place designed to ensure that our employees communicate any developments or discoveries they make to other employees however employees may choose to leave our company before transferring their knowledge and expertise to our other employees violations by others of our confidentiality or nondisclosure agreements and the loss of employees who have specialized knowledge and expertise could harm our competitive position and cause our sales and operating results to decline our trade secrets may otherwise become known or independently developed by others and trade secret laws provide no remedy against independent development or discovery 

  

service marks and trademarks—our failure to obtain trademark registrations or service marks or challenges to those marks could impede our marketing efforts 

  

we have registered and applied for some service marks and trademarks and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional service marks and trademarks as appropriate we cannot guarantee the approval of any of our pending applications by the applicable governmental authorities moreover even if the applications are approved third parties may seek to oppose or otherwise challenge these registrations a failure to obtain trademark registrations in the united states and in other countries could limit our ability to use our trademarks and impede our marketing efforts in those jurisdictions 

  

environmental matters—we could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs fines and civil or criminal sanctions as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws 

  

our operations inside and outside the united states are subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites in addition to the us federal state and local laws to which our domestic operations are subject our extensive international manufacturing operations subject us to environmental regulations imposed by foreign governments 

  

although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection at our sites inside and outside the united states we could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs fines and civil or criminal sanctions thirdparty property damage or personal injury claims if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or become noncompliant with environmental permits required at our facilities contaminants have been detected at some of our present and former sites principally in connection with historical operations in addition we have been named as a potentially responsible party at several superfund sites while we are not currently aware of any contaminated or superfund sites as to which material outstanding claims or obligations exist the discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of additional cleanup obligations at these or other sites could result in significant liability in addition the ultimate costs under environmental laws and the timing of these costs are difficult to predict liability under some environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can be imposed retroactively and on a joint and several basis in other words one liable party could be held liable for all costs at a site potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with environmental laws that may be adopted or imposed in the future 

  

dependence on key personnel—the loss of some key executive officers and employees could negatively impact our business prospects 

  

our future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued service of key members of management as well as marketing sales and product development personnel the loss of one or more of our key personnel would have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition we believe our future success will also depend in large part upon our ability to attract retain and further motivate highly skilled management marketing sales and product development personnel a significant portion of the incentive compensation for our senior management vested in calendar year 2003 and substantially all of this compensation will have vested by november 2004 we may not be able to provide our senior management with adequate additional incentives to remain employed by us after this time we have experienced intense competition for personnel and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our key employees or that we will be successful in attracting assimilating and retaining personnel in the future 

  

system failures—system failures caused by events beyond our control could adversely affect computer equipment and electronic data on which our operations depend 

  

our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer equipment and the information stored in our databases from damage by among other things earthquake fire natural disaster power loss telecommunications failures unauthorized intrusion and other catastrophic events as our operations become more automated and increasingly interdependent our exposure to the risks posed by these types of events will increase a significant part of our operations is based in an area of california that has experienced power outages and earthquakes and is considered seismically active we do not have a contingency plan for addressing the kinds of events referred to in this paragraph that would be sufficient to prevent system failures and other interruptions in our operations that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

potential tax legislation—negative publicity about companies located in certain offshore jurisdictions may lead to new legislation that could increase our tax burden 

  

several members of the united states congress have introduced legislation relating to the us federal tax treatment of us companies that have undertaken certain types of expatriation transactions while we do not believe that this legislation as currently proposed would adversely affect us the exact scope of the legislation and whether it will ultimately be enacted is unclear at this time in addition certain state legislatures have proposed similar legislation therefore it is possible that federal or state legislation in this area if enacted could materially increase our future tax burden or otherwise affect our business 

  

risks related to our substantial indebtedness 

  

substantial leverage—our substantial leverage may place us at a competitive disadvantage in our industry 

  

we are leveraged and have significant debt service obligations our significant debt and debt service requirements could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities for example our high level of debt presents the following risks to you 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

significant debt service requirements—servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate cash may be affected by factors beyond our control 

  

our business may not generate cash flow in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay the principal of or interest on our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs including working capital capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control we cannot assure you that 

  

   

   

   

if we cannot fund our liquidity needs we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances selling assets restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital we cannot assure you that any of these remedies could if necessary be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all in addition our existing debt instruments permit us to incur a significant amount of additional debt if we incur additional debt above the levels now in effect the risks associated with our substantial leverage including the risk that we will be unable to service our debt or generate enough cash flow to fund our liquidity needs could intensify 

  

restrictions imposed by debt covenants—restrictions imposed by our existing debt instruments will limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in our interest 

  

our existing debt instruments including the indenture governing our outstanding 8 senior notes impose and the terms of any future debt may impose operating and other restrictions on us the indenture governing our 8 senior notes limits our ability to incur additional indebtedness if our consolidated coverage ratio which is the ratio of the aggregate consolidated ebitda of our subsidiary seagate technology hdd holdings the issuer of our 8 senior notes and its restricted subsidiaries to the total interest expense of those entities is less than or equal to 30 to 10 during any consecutive fourquarter period our existing debt instruments also limit among other things our ability to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

these covenants are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions including exceptions that permit us to make significant distributions of cash in addition the obligation to comply with many of the covenants under the indenture governing our 8 senior notes will cease to apply if the notes achieve investment grade status 

  

our existing debt instruments also require us to achieve specified financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control 

  

a breach of any of the restrictive covenants described above or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our existing debt instruments if a default occurs the holders of our outstanding 8 senior notes may elect to declare all of our outstanding obligations together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable if our outstanding indebtedness were to be accelerated we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full that debt and any future indebtedness which would cause the market price of our common shares to decline significantly 

  

risks related to our common shares 

  

control by our sponsor group—because our sponsor group through its ownership of new sac will continue to hold a controlling interest in us the influence of our public shareholders over significant corporate actions will be limited 

  

as of july 2 2004 new sac owns approximately 615 of our outstanding common shares new sac was formed in connection with the november 2000 transactions and is owned by our sponsor group and members of our management through their ownership of new sac as of july 2 2004 affiliates of silver lake partners texas pacific group august capital jp morgan partners llc and investment partnerships affiliated with goldman sachs  co indirectly own approximately 195 136 70 40 and 13 respectively of our outstanding common shares the sponsors’ and our managements’ ownership of new sac and new sac’s and the sponsors’ ownership of us is the subject of shareholders agreements and other arrangements that result in the sponsors’ acting as a group with respect to all matters submitted to our shareholders as a result as long as new sac or the members of our sponsor group continue to own over 50 of our outstanding common shares they will continue to have the power to 

  

   

   

   

even if new sac holds less than 50 of our outstanding common shares and loses certain contractual rights under our shareholders agreement it will continue to have a significant influence over these matters also new sac is not prohibited from selling a controlling interest in us to a third party 

  

accordingly our ability to engage in significant transactions such as a merger acquisition or liquidation is limited without the consent of new sac which is controlled by the members of our sponsor group conflicts of 

  

interest could arise between us and new sac or our sponsor group and any conflict of interest may be resolved in a manner that does not favor us the members of our sponsor group may continue to retain control of us for the foreseeable future even if new sac distributes its shares in us to the new sac shareholders the members of our sponsor group may decide not to enter into a transaction in which you would receive consideration for your common shares that is much higher than the cost to you or the thencurrent market price of those shares in addition the members of our sponsor group could elect to sell a controlling interest in us and you may receive less than the thencurrent fair market value or the price you paid for your shares any decision regarding their ownership of us that members of our sponsor group may make at some future time will be in their absolute discretion 

  

future sales—additional sales of our common shares by new sac our sponsors or our employees or issuances by us in connection with future acquisitions or otherwise could cause the price of our common shares to decline 

  

if new sac or—after any distribution to our sponsors of our shares by new sac—our sponsors sell a substantial number of our common shares in the future the market price of our common shares could decline the perception among investors that these sales may occur could produce the same effect new sac and our sponsors have rights subject to specified conditions to require us to file registration statements covering common shares or to include common shares in registration statements that we may file specifically any of new sac silver lake partners texas pacific group or august capital can unilaterally require that we file registration statements covering common shares held by new sac in addition either silver lake partners or texas pacific group can unilaterally cause new sac to distribute its shares in us to our sponsor group and new sac’s other shareholders by exercising their registration or distribution rights and selling a large number of common shares new sac or any of the sponsors could cause the price of our common shares to decline furthermore if we were to include common shares in a registration statement initiated by us those additional shares could impair our ability to raise needed capital by depressing the price at which we could sell our common shares 

  

one component of our business strategy is to make acquisitions in the event of any future acquisitions we could issue additional common shares which would have the effect of diluting your percentage ownership of the common shares and could cause the price of our common shares to decline 

  

volatile public markets—the price of our common shares may be volatile and could decline significantly 

  

the stock market in general and the market for technology stocks in particular has recently experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of companies if these market or industrybased fluctuations continue the trading price of our common shares could decline significantly independent of our actual operating performance and you could lose all or a substantial part of your investment the market price of our common shares could fluctuate significantly in response to several factors including among others 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

failure to pay quarterly distributions—our failure to pay quarterly distributions to our common shareholders could cause the market price of our common shares to decline significantly 

  

we made quarterly cash distributions of 004 per share on each of august 22 2003 and november 21 2003 to all of our shareholders of record as of august 8 2003 and november 7 2003 respectively including new sac we made quarterly cash distributions of 006 per share on each of february 27 2004 and may 21 2004 to all of our shareholders of record as of february 13 2004 and may 7 2004 respectively including new sac on july 19 2004 our board of directors declared a quarterly distribution of 006 per share to be paid on or before august 20 2004 to our shareholders of record as of august 6 2004 

  

our ability to pay quarterly distributions will be subject to among other things general business conditions within the rigid disc drive industry our financial results the impact of paying distributions on our credit ratings and legal and contractual restrictions on the payment of distributions by our subsidiaries to us or by us to our shareholders including restrictions imposed by the covenants contained in the indenture governing our senior notes and the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities any reduction or discontinuation of quarterly distributions could cause the market price of our common shares to decline significantly moreover in the event our payment of quarterly distributions is reduced or discontinued our failure or inability to resume paying distributions at historical levels could result in a persistently low market valuation of our common shares 

  

taxation of distributions—certain us shareholders may be ineligible for favorable us federal income tax treatment on distributions on our common shares 

  

because we did not have any current or accumulated earnings and profits for us federal income tax purposes for our taxable year ended july 2 2004 distributions on our common shares during this period were treated as a return of capital rather than dividend income for us federal income tax purposes there can be no assurance however that we will not have current or accumulated earnings and profits for us federal income tax purposes in future years to the extent that we have current or accumulated earnings and profits for us federal income tax purposes distributions on our common shares will not be treated as a return of capital distribution and will be treated as dividend income 

  

furthermore we currently believe that we are a foreign personal holding company for us federal income tax purposes under recent us federal income tax legislation us shareholders who are individuals will not be eligible for reduced rates of taxation applicable to certain dividend income currently a maximum rate of 15 on distributions on our common shares if we qualify as a foreign personal holding company in the year in which such distributions were made or in the preceding taxable year as a result if distributions on our common shares are treated as dividend income because we have current or accumulated earnings and profits in the taxable year in which such distributions are made us shareholders who are individuals may not qualify for favorable us federal income tax treatment under the new legislation 

  

potential governmental action—governmental action against companies located in offshore jurisdictions may lead to a reduction in the demand for our common shares 

  

recently several state and other governmental officials have threatened to take legislative and other actions against us companies that have expatriated to specific foreign jurisdictions for example the california state treasurer has requested that certain pension funds eliminate from their investment portfolios all public equity and fixed income holdings of companies that have reincorporated in foreign jurisdictions if we are included within the scope of such legislation or governmental action it may reduce the demand for and have a material adverse effect on the price of our common shares 

  

securities litigation—significant fluctuations in the market price of our common shares could result in securities class action claims against us 

  

significant price and value fluctuations have occurred with respect to the publicly traded securities of rigid disc drive companies and technology companies generally the price of our common shares is likely to be 

  

volatile in the future in the past following periods of decline in the market price of a company’s securities class action lawsuits have often been pursued against that company if similar litigation were pursued against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

limited protection of shareholder interests—holders of the common shares may face difficulties in protecting their interests because we are incorporated under cayman islands law 

  

our corporate affairs are governed by our second amended and restated memorandum and articles of association by the companies law 2003 revision and the common law of the cayman islands the rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under cayman islands law are not as clearly established as under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in jurisdictions in the united states therefore you may have more difficulty in protecting your interests in the face of actions by our management directors or controlling shareholder than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction in the united states due to the comparatively less developed nature of cayman islands law in this area 

  

unlike many jurisdictions in the united states cayman islands law does not specifically provide for shareholder appraisal rights on a merger or consolidation of a company this may make it more difficult for you to assess the value of any consideration you may receive in a merger or consolidation or to require that the offeror give you additional consideration if you believe the consideration offered is insufficient 

  

shareholders of cayman islands exempted companies such as ourselves have no general rights under cayman islands law to inspect corporate records and accounts or to obtain copies of lists of shareholders of the company our directors have discretion under our articles of association to determine whether or not and under what conditions our corporate records may be inspected by our shareholders but are not obliged to make them available to our shareholders this may make it more difficult for you to obtain the information needed to establish any facts necessary for a shareholder motion or to solicit proxies from other shareholders in connection with a proxy contest 

  

subject to limited exceptions under cayman islands law a minority shareholder may not bring a derivative action against the board of directors our cayman islands counsel is not aware of any reported class action or derivative action having been brought in a cayman islands court 

  

antitakeover provisions could discourage or prevent an acquisition of us—provisions of our articles of association and cayman islands corporate law may impede a takeover which could adversely affect the value of the common shares 

  

our articles of association permit our board of directors to issue preferred shares from time to time with such rights and preferences as they consider appropriate our board of directors could authorize the issuance of preferred shares with terms and conditions and under circumstances that could have an effect of discouraging a takeover or other transaction 

  

unlike many jurisdictions in the united states cayman islands law does not provide for mergers as that expression is understood under corporate law in the united states while cayman islands law does have statutory provisions that provide for the reconstruction and amalgamation of companies which are commonly referred to in the cayman islands as a “scheme of arrangement” the procedural and legal requirements necessary to consummate these transactions are more rigorous and take longer to complete than the procedures typically required to consummate a merger in the united states under cayman islands law and practice a scheme of arrangement in relation to a solvent cayman islands exempted company must be approved at a shareholders’ meeting by a majority of the company’s shareholders who are present and voting either in person or by proxy at such meeting the shares voted in favor of the scheme of arrangement must also represent at least 75 of the value of each class of the company’s shareholders excluding the shares owned by the parties to the scheme of 

  

arrangement present and voting at the meeting the grand court of the cayman islands must also sanction the convening of these meetings and the terms of the amalgamation although there is no requirement to seek the consent of the creditors of the parties involved in the scheme of arrangement the grand court typically seeks to ensure that the creditors have consented to the transfer of their liabilities to the surviving entity or that the scheme of arrangement does not otherwise materially adversely affect the creditors’ interests furthermore the grand court will only approve a scheme of arrangement if it is satisfied that 

  

   

   

   

   

enforcement of civil liabilities—holders of our common shares may have difficulty obtaining or enforcing a judgment against us because we are incorporated under the laws of the cayman islands 

  

because we are a cayman islands exempted company there is uncertainty as to whether the grand court of the cayman islands would recognize or enforce judgments of united states courts obtained against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof or be competent to hear original actions brought in the cayman islands against us predicated upon the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof 

  

   

interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and longterm debt we currently do not use derivative financial instruments in either our investment portfolio or to hedge debt 

  

we invest in high credit quality issuers and by policy limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer as stated in our policy we are averse to principal loss and ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk 

  

we mitigate default risk by maintaining a diversified portfolio and by investing in only high quality securities we constantly monitor our investment portfolio and position our portfolio to respond appropriately to a reduction in credit rating of any investment issuer guarantor or depository we maintain a highly liquid portfolio by investing only in marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets 

  

we have both fixed and floating rate debt obligations we enter into debt obligations to support general corporate purposes including capital expenditures and working capital needs we have used derivative financial instruments in the form of an interest rate swap agreement to hedge a portion of our floating rate debt obligations our last interest rate swap agreement matured in november 2002 we currently have no swap agreements

 item 1 business 

  

we are a leader in the design manufacturing and marketing of rigid disc drives rigid disc drives which are commonly referred to as hard drives are used as the primary medium for storing electronic information in systems ranging from desktop computers and consumer electronics to data centers delivering information over corporate networks and the internet we produce a broad range of rigid disc drive products that make us a leader in both the enterprise sector of our industry where our products are primarily used in enterprise servers mainframes and workstations and the personal storage sector of our industry where our products are used in pcs and consumer electronics we have also recently introduced new products for the mobile sector where our rigid disc drives are used in notebook computers 

  

we are committed to a longterm strategic plan developed in 1998 which involves ownership of critical component technologies a commitment to advanced research and development and a focus on manufacturing and supply chain efficiency and flexibility this longterm plan involves 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

we sell our rigid disc drives primarily to major original equipment manufacturers or oems with whom we have longstanding relationships these customers include dell emc hewlettpackard ibm and sun microsystems we also have key relationships with major distributors who sell our rigid disc drive products to small oems dealers system integrators and retailers throughout most of the world 

  

industry 

  

demand for electronic data storage 

  

we believe that the amount of data stored and accessed electronically is growing rapidly and that there are a number of key factors driving this demand including 

  

   

   

   

   

rigid disc drives are the primary devices used for storing managing and protecting the electronic data associated with all of these applications 

  

we are particularly focused on three areas of growing demand for rigid disc drives 

  

growth in rigid disc drives for consumer electronics  highperformance computing and communications functions and increasingly rigid disc drives are being incorporated into consumer electronics such as video game consoles including microsoft’s xbox digital video recorders and advanced television settop boxes in addition faster connections to the internet and increased broadband capacity have encouraged consumers to download greater amounts of text video and audio data expanding the market for rigid disc drives for use in new consumer and entertainment appliances the adoption and rapid growth of the use of rigid disc drives in these applications will be facilitated by the development of lowcost rigid disc drives that meet the pricing requirements of the consumer electronics market 

  

growth in rigid disc drives for notebook computers the notebook computer market is expected to grow faster than any other pc segment as performance and price continue to improve placing notebooks in an attractive position relative to desktop computers notebook systems are increasingly becoming replacement systems to desktop pcs and progressively more desirable to consumers as the need for mobility increases and wireless adoption continues to advance in addition the industry continually progresses towards smaller systems and devices 

  

growth of storage area networks and network attached storage  the need to address the dramatic expansion in data storage management requirements has spurred the evolution of new storage and data management technologies enterprises are increasingly offloading network traffic to dedicated storage area networks or sans in addition many enterprises are moving away from the use of serverattached storage to networkattached storage or nas these solutions combine highperformance storage products that are comprised principally of rigid disc drives with sophisticated software and communications technologies we expect that the market for these solutions will grow rapidly and will result in greater opportunities for the sale of highperformance highcapacity rigid disc drives 

  

success in our industry depends on technology and manufacturing leadership 

  

the design and manufacturing of rigid disc drives depends on highly advanced technology and manufacturing techniques especially in the areas of readwrite heads and recording media rigid disc drive manufacturers are distinguished by their level of integration which is the degree to which they control the technology used in their products and by whether they are captive producing rigid disc drives for their own computer systems or independent integrated manufacturers are companies that design and produce the critical technologies including readwrite heads and recording media used in their rigid disc drives an integrated approach enables them to lower manufacturing costs and to improve the functionality of components so that they work together efficiently in contrast manufacturers that are not integrated purchase most of their components from thirdparty suppliers upon whom they depend for key elements of their technological innovation and differentiation this can limit their ability to coordinate technology roadmaps and optimize the component design process for manufacturing efficiency and product reliability while making them reliant on the technology investment decisions of their suppliers independent manufacturers can enjoy a competitive advantage over captive manufacturers in working with original equipment manufacturers or oems because they do not compete with oems for computer system sales 

  

due to the significant challenges posed by the need to continually innovate and improve manufacturing efficiency the rigid disc drive industry continues to undergo significant consolidation as manufacturers and merchant component suppliers merge with other companies or exit the industry for instance ibm recently combined its rigid disc drive business with that of hitachi consolidation is likely to continue in our industry as the technological challenges and the associated levels of required investment grow increasing the competitive necessity of largescale operations we believe the competitive dynamics of the rigid disc drive industry favor integrated independent manufacturers with the scale to make substantial technology investments and apply them across a broad product portfolio and set of customers 

  

overview of rigid disc drive technology 

  

all rigid disc drives incorporate the same basic technology although individual products vary one or more rigid discs are attached to a spindle assembly powered by a spindle motor that rotates the discs at a high constant speed around a hub the discs or recording media are the components on which data is stored and from which it is retrieved each disc typically consists of a substrate of finely machined aluminum or glass with a layer of a thinfilm magnetic material readwrite heads mounted on an arm assembly similar in concept to that of a record player fly extremely close to each disc surface and record data on and retrieve it from concentric tracks in the magnetic layers of the rotating discs the readwrite heads are mounted vertically on an eshaped assembly the eblock and the recording media are mounted inside a metal casing called the base casting 

  

upon instructions from the drive’s electronic circuitry a head positioning mechanism or actuator guides the heads to the selected track of a disc where the data is recorded or retrieved application specific integrated circuits or asics and ancillary electronic control chips are collectively mounted on printed circuit boards asics move data to and from the readwrite head and the internal controller or interface which communicates with the host computer rigid disc drive manufacturers typically use one or more of several industry standard interfaces such as advanced technology architecture or ata small computer system interface or scsi and fibre channel recently a new standard serial ata has been introduced serial ata provides higher data transfer rates than the previous ata standard 

  

rigid disc drive performance is commonly assessed by five key characteristics 

  

   

   

   

   

   

areal density is a measure of storage capacity per square inch on the recording surface of a disc current areal densities are sufficient to meet the requirements of most applications today we expect however the longterm demand for increased drive capacities to continue to grow as audio and visual data require many multiples of the storage capacity of simple text we have pursued and expect to continue to pursue a range of technologies to increase areal densities across the entire range of our products to increase drive capacities and to allow the elimination of components at a stated capacity as areal density increases thus reducing costs 

  

manufacturing 

  

we pursue an integrated business strategy based on the ownership of critical component technologies this strategy allows us to maintain control over our product roadmap and component cost quality and availability our manufacturing efficiency and flexibility is a critical element of our integrated business strategy during the past several years we have made significant improvements in our manufacturing efficiency by 

  

   

   

   

   

   

manufacturing our rigid disc drives is a complex process that begins with the production of individual components and ends with a fully assembled unit we design assemble andor manufacture a number of the most important components found in our rigid disc drives including readwrite heads recording media printed circuit boards spindle motors and asics 

  

readwrite heads  the function of the readwrite head is to scan across the disc as it spins magnetically recording or reading information the tolerances of recording heads are extremely demanding and require stateoftheart equipment and processes our readwrite heads are manufactured with thinfilm and photolithographic processes similar to those used to produce semiconductor integrated circuits beginning with six inch round ceramic wafers we process more than 25000 head elements at one time each of these head elements goes through more than 300 steps all in clean room environments our readwrite heads require highly advanced processes with tolerances approaching the thickness of a single atom we perform all primary stages of design and manufacture of readwrite heads at our facilities although the percentage of our requirements for readwrite heads that we produce internally varies from quarter to quarter we currently manufacture almost all of our readwrite heads 

  

recording media  the function of the recording media is to magnetically store information the domains where each bit of magnetic code is stored are extremely small and precisely placed as a result the manufacturing of recording media requires sophisticated thinfilm processes each disc is a sequentially processed set of layers that consist of structural magnetic protective and lubricating materials once complete the disc must have a high degree of physical uniformity to assure reliable and errorfree storage we purchase aluminum substrate blanks for recording media production from third parties mainly in japan these blanks are machined plated and polished to produce finished substrates at our plant in northern ireland although the percentage of our requirements for recording media that we produce internally varies from quarter to quarter we currently manufacture almost all of our recording media requirements we plan to expand our media production facility in singapore during fiscal year 2004 to further increase our production capacity our strategy is to purchase no more than 20 of our recording media requirements from thirdparty suppliers in any given quarter 

  

printed circuit boards  we assemble and test a significant portion of the printed circuit boards used in our rigid disc drives printed circuit boards are the boards that contain the electronic circuitry and asics that provide the electronic controls of the rigid disc drive and on which the headdisc assembly is mounted we assemble printed circuit boards at our facilities in malaysia and singapore 

  

spindle motors  we design most of our spindle motors and purchase them principally from outside vendors in asia whom we have licensed to use our intellectual property and technology 

  

asics  we participate in the design of many of the asics used in our rigid disc drives for motor and actuator control such as interface controllers readwrite channels and preamplifiers we do not manufacture any asics but rather buy them from thirdparty suppliers 

  

following the production of the individual components of the rigid disc drive the first step in the manufacture of a rigid disc drive itself is the assembly of the actuator arm readwrite heads discs and spindle motor in a housing to form the headdisc assembly the production of the headdisc assembly involves largely automated processes printed circuit boards are then mated to the headdisc assembly and the completed unit is tested prior to packaging and shipment final assembly and test operations of our rigid disc drives occur primarily at facilities located in china and singapore we perform subassembly and component manufacturing operations at our facilities in malaysia northern ireland singapore thailand and in the united states in california and minnesota in addition third parties manufacture and assemble components for us in various asian countries including china japan korea malaysia the philippines singapore taiwan and thailand and in europe and the united states

customers 

  

we sell our rigid disc drive products primarily to major oems and distributors oem customers incorporate our rigid disc drives into computer systems and storage systems for resale distributors typically sell our rigid disc drives to small oems dealers system integrators and other resellers shipments to oems were approximately 61 and 66 of our revenue in fiscal years 2003 and 2002 respectively shipments to distributors were approximately 39 and 34 of our revenue in fiscal years 2003 and 2002 respectively in may 2002 hewlettpackard completed its acquisition of compaq sales to hewlettpackard accounted for approximately 18 of our rigid disc drive revenue in fiscal year 2003 sales to hewlettpackard and compaq together accounted for approximately 20 of our rigid disc drive revenue in fiscal year 2002 no other customer accounted for 10 or more of our rigid disc drive revenue in fiscal years 2003 and 2002 see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—risk factors—risks related to our business—dependence on key customers” 

  

oem customers typically enter into master purchase agreements with us these agreements provide for pricing volume discounts order lead times product support obligations and other terms and conditions the term of these agreements is usually 12 to 36 months although our product support obligations generally extend substantially beyond this period these master agreements typically do not commit the customer to buy any minimum quantity of products or create exclusive relationships deliveries are scheduled only after receipt of purchase orders in addition with limited lead time customers may cancel or defer most purchase orders without significant penalty anticipated orders from many of our customers have in the past failed to materialize or oem delivery schedules have been deferred or altered as a result of changes in their business needs 

  

our distributors generally enter into nonexclusive agreements for the redistribution of our products they typically furnish us with a nonbinding indication of their nearterm requirements and product deliveries are generally scheduled based on a weekly confirmation by the distributor of its requirements for that week the agreements typically provide the distributors with price protection with respect to their inventory of our rigid disc drives at the time of a reduction by us in our selling price for the rigid disc drives and also provide limited rights to return the product 

  

we also regularly enter into agreements with our customers which obligate us to provide a limited indemnity against losses resulting from intellectual property claims these agreements are customary in our industry and typically require us to indemnify our customer against certain damages and costs incurred as a result of third party intellectual property claims arising as a result of their use of our products 

  

sales and marketing 

  

our sales organization focuses on deepening our relationship with our customers as of june 27 2003 our sales organization included approximately 391 employees who are divided into two groups the global oem sales group focuses on our key worldwide oem customers the worldwide sales group focuses on geographic coverage of oems and distributors throughout most of the world the worldwide sales group is organized regionally among the united states japan asiapacific excluding japan and europe africa and the middle east in addition we have a sales operations group which focuses on aligning our production levels with customers’ product requirements our sales force works directly with our marketing organization to coordinate our oem and distribution channel relationships we maintain sales offices throughout the united states and in australia china england france germany india ireland japan singapore and taiwan 

  

our marketing organization works to increase demand for our rigid disc drive products through strategic collaboration with key oem customers to align our respective product roadmaps and to build our brand and endcustomer relationships as of june 27 2003 our marketing organization had approximately 252 employees this organization is comprised of our strategic marketing business development and marketing communications groups our strategic marketing group coordinates with our research and development group to align our product development roadmap to meet key oem customers’ technology requirements over the long term our business development group coordinates the qualification of new products with oems determines product pricing and provides product service and support our marketing communications group focuses on building the seagate brand name among our oem and distribution channel customers 

  

foreign sales are subject to foreign exchange controls and other restrictions including in the case of some countries approval by the office of export administration of the us department of commerce and other us governmental agencies 

  

competition 

  

the rigid disc drive industry is intensely competitive with manufacturers competing for a limited number of major customers a significant portion of our recent success is a result of our increasing our market share at the expense of our competitors our current market share may be negatively affected by our customers’ preference to diversify their sources of supply or if they decide to meet their requirements by manufacturing rigid disc drives themselves particularly in the enterprise sector maintaining or improving market share is fundamental to succeeding in our industry and any significant increase in market share by one of our competitors would likely result in a decline in our market share some of the principal factors used by customers to differentiate among rigid disc drive manufacturers are 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we believe that our products are generally competitive with respect to each of these factors in the markets that we currently address we summarize below our principal competitors the effect of competition on price erosion for our products and product life cycles and technology 

  

principal competitors  we have experienced and expect to continue to experience intense competition from a number of domestic and foreign companies some of which have greater financial and other resources than we have these competitors include other independent rigid disc drive manufacturers such as maxtor and western digital as well as large captive manufacturers such as fujitsu hitachi global storage technologies samsung and toshiba because they produce complete computer systems captive manufacturers can derive a greater portion of their operating margins from other components which reduces their need to realize a profit on the rigid disc drives included in their computer systems and allows them to sell rigid disc drives to third parties at very low margins many captive manufacturers are also formidable competitors because they have more substantial resources and greater access to their internal customers than we do we also face indirect competition from present and potential customers who evaluate from time to time whether to manufacture their own rigid disc drives and other information storage products or purchase them from outside sources other than us these manufacturers also sell rigid disc drives to third parties which results in direct competition with us we expect that continued consolidation both among independent manufacturers and among captive manufacturers will increase the threat posed to our business by these competitors 

  

price erosion  our competitors have historically offered new or existing products at lower prices as part of a strategy to gain or retain market share and customers and we expect these practices to continue even during periods when demand for rigid disc drives is stable our industry is price competitive and vendors experience price erosion over the life of a product and such price erosion can be expected to increase to the extent product life cycles lengthen based on our recent experience in the industry with new product introductions we believe that the rate of increase in areal density is slowing from its previous levels this trend may contribute to increases in average price erosion to the extent that historical price erosion patterns continue product life cycles are lengthened and we are unable to offset this with new products at higher average prices we expect that price erosion in our industry will continue for the foreseeable future to remain competitive we believe it will be necessary to continue to reduce our prices we established production facilities in china malaysia singapore and thailand to achieve cost reductions 

  

product life cycles and changing technology  historically competition and changing customer preference and demand in the rigid disc drive industry have shortened product life cycles and caused an acceleration in the development and introduction of new technology based on the recent pace of new product introductions however we believe that the rate of increase in areal density has slowed and the resulting variability in product life cycles may make planning for product transitions more difficult particularly in the personal storage sector of our industry we believe that our future success will depend upon our ability to develop manufacture and market products of high quality and reliability which meet changing user needs and which successfully anticipate or respond to changes in technology and standards on a costeffective and timely basis 

  

research and development 

  

we believe that our success depends on our ability to develop products that meet changing user needs and to anticipate and respond to changes in technology on a costeffective and timely basis accordingly we are committed to developing new component technologies and products and to continually evaluating alternative technologies during fiscal years 2002 and 2003 we had product development expenses of 698 million and 670 million respectively 

  

we have increased our focus on research and development and realigned our rigid disc drive development process this structured product process is designed to bring new products to market through predictable and repeatable methodologies in 1998 we established seagate research based in pittsburgh pennsylvania which is dedicated to extending the capacity of magnetic and optical recording and exploring alternative data storage technologies including perpendicular recording technology and heat assisted magnetic recording technology perpendicular recording technology involves a different orientation for the magnetic field than is currently used in rigid disc drives and heat assisted magnetic recording technology uses heat generated by a laser to improve storage capacity in fiscal year 1998 we established our advanced concepts laboratory which focuses rigid disc drive and component research on recording subsystems including readwrite heads and recording media marketspecific product technology as well as technology focused towards new business opportunities the primary purpose of our advanced concepts laboratory is to ensure timely availability of mature component technologies to our product development teams as well as allowing us to leverage and coordinate those technologies across our products 

  

patents and licenses 

  

as of june 27 2003 we had approximately 2087 us patents and 723 patents issued in various foreign jurisdictions as well as approximately 1383 us and 1561 foreign patent applications pending the number of patents and patent applications will vary at any given time as part of our ongoing patent portfolio management activity due to the rapid technological change that characterizes the information storage industry we believe that the improvement of existing products reliance upon trade secret law the protection of unpatented proprietary knowhow and development of new products are generally more important than patent protection in establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage nevertheless we believe that patents are valuable to our business and intend to continue our efforts to obtain patents where available in connection with our research and development program 

  

the information storage industry is characterized by significant litigation relating to patent and other intellectual property rights because of rapid technological development in the information storage industry some of our products have been and in the future could be alleged to infringe existing patents of third parties from time to time we receive claims that our products infringe patents of third parties although we have been able to resolve some of those claims or potential claims by obtaining licenses or rights under the patents in question without a material adverse affect on us other claims have resulted in adverse decisions or settlements in addition other claims are pending which if resolved unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations for more information on these claims see “item 3 legal proceedings” the costs of engaging in intellectual property litigation may be substantial regardless of the merit of the claim or the outcome we have patent crosslicenses with a number of companies additionally as part of our normal intellectual property practices we are engaged in negotiations with other major rigid disc drive companies and component manufacturers with respect to ongoing patent crosslicenses for a discussion of the related risks see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—risk factors—risks related to our business—potential loss of licensed technology” 

  

backlog 

  

in view of customers’ rights to cancel or defer orders with little or no penalty we believe backlog in the rigid disc drive industry may be of limited indicative value in estimating future performance and results our backlog includes only those orders for which the customer has specified a delivery schedule because many customers place large orders for delivery throughout the year and because of the possibility of customer cancellation of orders or changes in delivery schedules our backlog as of any particular date is not indicative of our potential sales for any succeeding fiscal period our order backlog at june 27 2003 was approximately 1176 billion 

  

employees 

  

at june 27 2003 we employed approximately 43000 persons worldwide of which approximately 33000 employees were located in our asian operations in addition we make use of temporary employees principally in manufacturing who are hired on an asneeded basis we believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees at all levels and even then we cannot assure you of any such success we believe that our employee relations are good 

  

environmental matters 

  

our operations are subject to comprehensive us and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites some of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution and these permits are subject to modification renewal and revocation by issuing authorities 

  

we believe that our operations are currently in substantial compliance with all environmental laws regulations and permits we incur operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental laws if additional or more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future we could incur additional operating costs and capital expenditures 

  

some environmental laws such as the us federal superfund law and similar state statutes can impose liability for the cost of cleanup of contaminated sites upon any of the current or former site owners or operators or upon parties who sent waste to these sites regardless of whether the owner or operator owned the site at the time of the release of hazardous substances or the lawfulness of the original disposal activity we have been identified as a potentially responsible party at several superfund sites at each of these sites the government has assigned to us a portion of the financial liability based on the type and amount of hazardous substances disposed of by each party at the site and the number of financially viable parties 

  

some of our current and former sites have a history of commercial and industrial operations including the use of hazardous substances groundwater and soil contamination resulting from historical operations has been identified at several of our current and former facilities and we are addressing the cleanup of these sites in cooperation with the relevant government agencies 

  

while our ultimate costs in connection with these sites is difficult to predict with complete accuracy based on our current estimates of cleanup costs and our expected allocation of these costs we do not expect costs in connection with these superfund sites and contaminated sites to be material 

  

executive officers and directors

dividends 

  

on june 27 2003 our board of directors amended our quarterly dividend policy and pursuant to our amended policy we expect to pay our shareholders a quarterly distribution of up to 004 per share 016 annually so long as the aggregate amount of the distribution does not exceed 50 of our consolidated net income for the quarter in which the distribution is declared as determined under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states and reflected in our publicly filed financial statements for the quarter 

  

we are restricted in our ability to pay distributions by the covenants contained in the indenture governing our senior notes and the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities our declaration of distributions is also subject to cayman islands law and the discretion of our board of directors under the terms of the seagate technology shareholders agreement at least seven members of our board of directors must approve the payment of distributions in excess of 15 of our net income in the prior fiscal year in deciding whether or not to declare quarterly distributions our directors will take into account such factors as general business conditions within the rigid disc drive industry our financial results our capital requirements contractual and legal restrictions on the payment of distributions by our subsidiaries to us or by us to our shareholders the impact of paying distributions on our credit ratings and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant 

  

on july 14 2003 our board of directors declared a quarterly distribution of 004 per share to be paid on or before august 22 2003 to our shareholders of record as of august 8 2003 since the closing of our initial public offering we have made distributions pursuant to our quarterly dividend policy in effect at such time of 003 per share to our shareholders of record as of each of february 14 2003 and may 9 2003 these distributions have totaled approximately 26 million in the aggregate 

  

since the closing of the november 2000 transactions we have made additional distributions unrelated to our quarterly dividend policy these include 

  

   

   

   

to the extent that the amount of any distribution exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits for us federal income tax purposes in any taxable year the distribution will be treated as a return of capital for us tax purposes causing a reduction in a shareholder’s adjusted tax basis in the common shares we did not have current or accumulated earnings and profits for us federal income tax purposes for our taxable year ended june 27 2003 and accordingly distributions paid on our common shares during this period were treated as a return of capital for us federal income tax purposes there can be no assurances that we will not have current or accumulated earnings and profits for us federal income tax purposes in future years to the extent that we do have current or accumulated earnings and profits for us federal income tax purposes a distribution on our common shares will not be treated as a return of capital distribution and will be treated as dividend income 

  

furthermore we currently believe that we are a foreign personal holding company for us federal income tax purposes under recent us federal income tax legislation us shareholders who are individuals will not be eligible for reduced rates of taxation applicable to certain dividend income currently a maximum rate of 15 on distributions on our common shares if we qualify as a foreign personal holding company in the year in which such distributions were made or in the preceding taxable year

an indemnification agreement provides that new sac and its subsidiaries are required to indemnify veritas and its affiliates for specified liabilities of seagate delaware and seagate software holdings inc including selected taxes in return veritas seagate delaware and their affiliates agreed to indemnify new sac and its subsidiaries for specified liabilities including all taxes of seagate delaware for which new sac was not obligated to indemnify veritas and its affiliates veritas deposited 150 million in an escrow account which may be applied by new sac to satisfy certain tax liabilities and which remains in the escrow account in full to the extent that any part of the 150 million is not utilized to satisfy these tax liabilities it will be paid out to the former seagate delaware stockholders in july 2002 we and those of our affiliates that are parties to the indemnification agreement entered into a reimbursement agreement which allocates the respective liabilities and obligations under the indemnification agreement under the reimbursement agreement if we and our affiliates become obligated to indemnify seagate delaware veritas or any of their affiliates for tax liabilities under the indemnification agreement seagate technology hdd holdings will be responsible for the first 125 million of the tax liabilities and any amount exceeding 125 million will then be allocated among seagate technology hdd holdings seagate technology san holdings certance holdings and seagate software cayman holdings corporation on a pro rata basis in accordance with the portion of the purchase price allocated to each entity in connection with the november 2000 transactions for indemnification obligations other than tax liabilities under the indemnification agreement the responsible entity will reimburse any entity that satisfies the obligation on its behalf 

  

management rollover 

  

in connection with the november 2000 transactions approximately 100 members of seagate delaware’s management group entered into rollover agreements under which they agreed not to receive merger consideration consisting of veritas stock and cash in respect of a portion of their restricted shares of seagate delaware’s common stock and unvested options to purchase those shares the aggregate value of this foregone consideration was approximately 184 million instead of receiving this merger consideration members of the management group received restricted ordinary and preferred shares of new sac granted under the new sac 2000 restricted share plan and participation interests in our deferred compensation plan 

  

new sac restricted shares at the closing of the november 2000 transactions the board of directors of new sac adopted the new sac 2000 restricted share plan the 2000 restricted share plan allows for the awarding of grants of ordinary and preferred shares of new sac to management employees directors and consultants of new sac and its affiliates new sac issued 1843000 restricted ordinary shares and 48500 restricted preferred shares under this plan to those members of management participating in the rollover agreements described below the restricted ordinary and preferred shares granted under the 2000 restricted share plan vested as follows 

  

   

   

   

in addition at the closing of the november 2000 transactions certain individuals purchased additional ordinary and preferred shares of new sac for approximately 41 million in cash of this 41 million approximately 21 million was purchased by members of the management group 

  

following the closing of the november 2000 transactions the board of directors of new sac approved the 2001 restricted share plan unlike the 2000 restricted share plan the 2001 restricted share plan only provides for the grant of restricted ordinary shares of new sac and does not provide for the grant of restricted preferred shares of new sac like the 2000 restricted share plan the 2001 restricted share plan allows for the award of grants to management employees directors and consultants of new sac and its affiliates new sac has issued 483523 restricted ordinary shares under this plan restricted shares granted under the 2001 restricted share plan will vest as follows 

  

   

   

new sac redeemed all of its outstanding preferred shares as of march 14 2003 as of june 27 2003 there were 2255920 restricted ordinary shares outstanding under both the 2000 and 2001 restricted share plans accordingly we have been recognizing and will continue to recognize compensation expense of approximately 28 million proportionately over the respective vesting periods based on the estimated fair value of these shares on the date of issuance through june 27 2003 we had recognized 26 million of this compensation expense 

  

deferred compensation plan  in connection with the management rollover and in addition to the grant of restricted ordinary and preferred shares of new sac members of the management group received approximately 179 million of interests in deferred compensation plans adopted by our whollyowned subsidiaries each member of the management group received an interest in one of the plans with the substantial majority of the members receiving interests in the seagate technology hdd holdings plan at inception the interests in the deferred compensation plan were subject to multiyear vesting 

  

in may 2002 we made 32 million in payments to participants in the deferred compensation plan on june 19 2002 the board of directors accelerated vesting of all deferred compensation interests under the terms of the plan as a result of certain distributions by new sac to holders of its preferred shares in connection with our initial public offering seagate technology hdd holdings became obligated to make payments of approximately 147 million to participants of its deferred compensation plan including named executive officers those payments were made following the closing of our initial public offering thereby satisfying all remaining obligations under the deferred compensation plan 

  

seagate technology share option plan 

  

in december 2000 our board of directors adopted our share option plan under the terms of this share option plan eligible employees directors and consultants can be awarded options to purchase our common shares under vesting terms to be determined at the date of grant in january 2002 this share option plan was amended to increase the maximum number of common shares issuable under the share option plan from 72 million to 100 million shares no options to purchase our common shares had been issued through june 29 2001 from july 1 2001 through june 27 2003 options to purchase 87954753 common shares were granted to employees under this share option plan net of cancellations this represents approximately 17 of our total voting power assuming the exercise of all options as of june 27 2003 options to purchase 14870267 common shares had been exercised 

  

allocation of net purchase price 

  

new sac accounted for the november 2000 transactions as a purchase in accordance with accounting principles board or apb opinion no 16 “business combinations” all acquired tangible assets identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities were valued based on their relative fair values and reorganized into the following businesses 

  

   

   

   

   

certance holdings crystal decisions and stih are direct or indirect subsidiaries of new sac and are not owned by us the fair value of the net assets acquired by new sac exceeded the net purchase price of 1840 billion by approximately 909 million accordingly the resultant negative goodwill was allocated on a pro rata basis to the acquired longlived assets and reduced the recorded amounts by approximately 46 

  

the table below summarizes the allocation of net purchase price by new sac dollars in millions 

  

     trade names —the value of the trade names was based upon discounting to their net present value the licensing income that would arise by charging the operating businesses that use the trade names 

developed technologies—the value of this asset for each operating business was determined by discounting to their net present value the expected future cash flows attributable to all existing technologies that had reached technological feasibility after considering risks relating to a the characteristics and applications of the technology b existing and future markets and c life cycles of the technologies estimates of future revenues and expenses used to determine the value of developed technology were consistent with the historical trends in the industry and expected performance 

  

assembled workforces —the value of the assembled workforce was determined by estimating the recruiting hiring and training costs to replace each group of existing employees 

inprocess research and development —the value of inprocess research and development was based on an evaluation of all developmental projects using the guidance set forth in interpretation no 4 of financial accounting standards board or fasb statement no 2 “accounting for research and development costs” and fasb statement no 86 “accounting for the cost of computer software to be sold leased or otherwise marketed” 

the amount was determined by a obtaining management estimates of future revenues and operating profits associated with existing developmental projects b projecting the cash flows and costs to completion of the underlying technologies and resultant products and c discounting these cash flows to their net present value 

estimates of future revenues and expenses used to determine the value of inprocess research and development were consistent with the historical trends in the industry and expected performance the entire amount was charged to operations because related technologies had not reached technological feasibility and they had no alternative future use 

   

allocation of purchase price to us pursuant to the application of push down accounting 

  

the november 2000 transactions constituted a purchase transaction by new sac of substantially all the operating assets and liabilities of seagate delaware under purchase accounting rules the net purchase price has been allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities of seagate delaware and its subsidiaries based on their estimated fair values at the date of the november 2000 transactions new sac estimated the fair values including inprocess research and development however the estimated fair values of identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired from seagate delaware and its subsidiaries were greater than the amount paid resulting in negative goodwill the negative goodwill was allocated to the longlived tangible and intangible assets as well as inprocess research and development this includes amounts relating to seagate technology on the basis of relative fair values subsequently in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2002 in accordance with sfas 109 we reduced the net carrying value of the longlived intangibles from 104 million to zero to reflect the recognition of tax benefits see note 5 of the audited consolidated and combined financial statements of seagate technology and its predecessor 

  

in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 54 “push down basis of accounting required in certain limited circumstances” the accounting for the purchase transaction has been “pushed down” from new sac to our financial statements our condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for all periods subsequent to november 23 2000 reflect the new basis in our assets and liabilities at that date including the pushed down purchase accounting adjustments 

  

as a result of the november 2000 transactions and the push down accounting our results of operations following the november 2000 transactions particularly the depreciation and amortization charges are not necessarily comparable to our predecessor’s results of operations prior to the november 2000 transactions depreciation charges following the november 2000 transactions are lower as a result of writedowns of our depreciable assets pursuant to purchase accounting rules the favorable effect on results of operations from these lower charges will gradually decrease in future periods as our older assets become fully depreciated and new higherpriced assets are acquired 

  

current trends affecting our results of operations 

  

industry dynamics our industry is characterized by several trends that have a material impact on our strategic planning financial condition and results of operations one key trend has been the decline in spending on information technology by enterprises and consumers as a result of the weakened global economy the slowdown in enterprise expenditures is also a result of the extensive investments that many enterprises had already made in recent years before the global economic slowdown currently demand for rigid disc drives in the enterprise sector is being adversely impacted as a result of the weakened economy and because enterprises have shifted their focus from making new equipment purchases to more efficiently using their existing information technology infrastructure through among other things adopting new storage architectures 

  

simultaneously with this economic weakness there has been continued consolidation and attrition among our competitors for instance in 2001 maxtor merged with quantum’s rigid disc drive operations and ibm recently merged its rigid disc drive business with that of hitachi also in 2001 fujitsu ceased manufacturing rigid disc drives for the personal storage market this consolidation among our competitors has contributed to shifts in market share as newly combined companies focus on integrating their operations and oems maintain diversity by shifting their purchasing allocations to new suppliers also as manufacturers merge or exit the rigid disc drive industry they frequently liquidate their excess inventory leading to competitive pressure which has resulted in even lower selling prices 

  

consolidation is also occurring among our customers for example compaq our largest customer in fiscal 2001 merged with hewlettpackard in our fiscal year 2002 as a result of this trend our customer base is increasingly concentrated among fewer oems potentially providing them with increased pricing leverage in the event that our sales to a combined entity are less than or are on terms that are less favorable than our sales to these customers when they were separate entities our results of operations would suffer 

  

historically our industry has been characterized by continuous and significant advances in technology which contributed to rapid product life cycles the importance of being first to market with new products and the difficulty in recovering research and development expenses however based upon the recent pace of new product introductions we believe that our industry is entering a period in which the rate of increases in areal density will be lower than the rate of the last several years the slowing change in areal density contributes to 

  

   

   

seagate dynamics during the past several years we have restructured our operations to reduce our costs and improve our manufacturing efficiency and flexibility since 1998 we and our predecessor have implemented restructuring plans that have resulted in total net charges of approximately 361 million the closing of 14 facilities and a reduction in headcount of approximately 40000 employees through our factory of the future initiative we have increased the use of automation in our manufacturing operations we believe that these changes in our operations have added to our manufacturing flexibility allowing us to improve our responsiveness to customers and take advantage of unforecasted sales opportunities to deliver products on short notice additionally we have substantially improved our gross margin due to these ongoing cost savings from our restructuring activities and our programs to implement operating efficiencies we have further benefited from reductions in depreciation expense resulting from writedowns to the fair market value of our depreciable assets in connection with the november 2000 transactions the favorable effects on results of operations from these lower depreciation charges in connection with the writedown will gradually decrease in future periods as our older assets become fully depreciated and new higherpriced assets are acquired and recorded at cost we believe our reduced cost structure and improved manufacturing efficiency provides us with greater flexibility to address changing market conditions 

  

we maintain a highly integrated approach to our business by designing and manufacturing components we view as critical to our products such as readwrite heads and recording media we believe that our control of these key technologies combined with our innovations in manufacturing enable us to achieve product performance and timetomarket leadership this leadership position has enabled us to leverage our investments in research and development although we believe that we derive an important competitive advantage as a result of this strategy it results in higher fixed costs which may adversely affect our financial performance in periods of declining demand this approach also increases the importance of realizing and maintaining substantial market share in the markets in which we compete allowing us to spread our technology investments across a high unit volume of products 

  

the slowing rate of increase of areal density has increased the importance of our successful execution of new product transitions and of competitive factors such as quality reliability and our manufacturing yield we recently completed our transition to the 80 gigabyte per disc platform for our desktop products and our improved manufacturing yields from these products have contributed to our recent financial performance we also have begun limited revenue shipments of our first notebook products the momentus disc drives which address a segment of the notebook computer market although we are shipping notebook drives to oems we currently have not completed qualification programs with a number of oems which are material to the success of these products 

  

because we use a fiscal year instead of a calendar year it is necessary every four to five years to realign our fiscal quarterends with calendar quarterends as a result fiscal year 2004 will have 53 weeks and our first quarter of the year will have 14 weeks ended on october 3 2003 we do not expect the additional week in the first quarter to have a material impact on our operating results as compared to what we would have expected during a 13week quarter 

  

disposition of assets 

  

sale of xiotech corporation on november 4 2002 we sold xiotech to new sac new sac in turn sold 51 of xiotech to a third party in a transaction in which xiotech also sold newly issued shares to this third party as a result new sac has retained an interest of less than 20 of xiotech 

  

in consideration of our sale of xiotech to new sac we received a 32 million promissory note from new sac the amount of this promissory note was equal to the estimated fair value of xiotech as of the date of the sale net of intercompany indebtedness immediately after the sale of xiotech to new sac we made an inkind pro rata distribution of the entire promissory note to our existing shareholders including new sac which at the time owned approximately 994 of our outstanding shares that portion of the promissory note distributed back to new sac was cancelled and new sac immediately paid off the remaining 06 of the promissory note held by our minority shareholders as a result of our sale of xiotech we no longer consolidated xiotech’s operations with our operations subsequent to november 4 2002 

  

because new sac at the time owned approximately 994 of our outstanding shares our sale of xiotech to new sac was recorded as a distribution of an amount equal to the net book value of xiotech rather than as a sale for the fair value of the promissory note as of november 4 2002 the net book value of xiotech was approximately 1 million 

  

repair and warranty services agreement on october 28 2002 we closed the sale of our product repair and servicing facility in reynosa mexico and certain related equipment and inventory to a wholly owned subsidiary of jabil circuit inc after the sale jabil became our primary source provider of warranty repair services for a multiyear period at costs defined in a longterm services agreement during the term of this services agreement we will be dependent upon jabil to effectively manage warranty repair related costs and activities 

  

the arrangement with jabil is comprised of various elements including the sale of the facility equipment and inventory our obligations under the services agreement and potential reimbursements by us to jabil because the fair values of each of these elements have not been separately established and because we will repurchase the inventory sold to jabil the 10 million excess of the sale prices assigned to the various elements of the arrangements with jabil over their respective carrying values will be offset against cost of revenue as a reduction to warranty expense over the period of the longterm services agreement of the 10 million excess 5 million was utilized in the quarter ended december 27 2002 to offset an immediate repair cost increase and the remaining 5 million is being utilized over the remaining period of the longterm services agreement 

  

stock compensation expense 

  

in connection with certain options granted during the six months ended december 27 2002 we recorded deferred stock compensation totaling 107 million representing the difference between the exercise price and the deemed fair value of our common shares on the dates such options were granted this deferred stock compensation is being amortized over the vesting periods of the underlying stock options of 48 months through june 27 2003 we have amortized approximately 2 million of such compensation expense 

  

consummation of initial public offering 

  

on december 13 2002 we completed the initial public offering of 72500000 of our common shares 24000000 of which were sold by us and 48500000 of which were sold by new sac our parent company as selling shareholder at a price of 12 per share we received proceeds from our sale of the 24000000 newly issued common shares of approximately 270 million after deducting underwriting fees discounts and commissions in connection with our initial public offering all previously outstanding shares of preferred stock aggregating 400 million shares were converted by new sac into our common stock immediately prior to the closing of our initial public offering we paid a return of capital distribution of 262 million or 065 per share to the holders of our thenoutstanding shares including new sac we also paid a lump sum of approximately 12 million to members of our sponsor group in exchange for the discontinuation of an annual monitoring fee of 2 million this payment was charged to marketing and administrative expense during the quarter ended december 27 2002 

  

new sac received proceeds of approximately 557 million from the sale of 48500000 common shares in our initial public offering after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions new sac distributed these net proceeds together with the proceeds from the distribution described above to holders of its preferred and ordinary shares as a result of the distribution to new sac’s preferred shareholders our whollyowned subsidiary seagate technology hdd holdings became obligated to make payments of approximately 147 million to the participants in its deferred compensation plan these payments were made following the closing of our initial public offering and as a consequence there are no longer any outstanding obligations under that deferred compensation plan 

  

consummation of secondary public offering 

  

under the seagate technology shareholders agreement among new sac our financial sponsors and us new sac has demand registration rights to request from time to time that we register and sell shares of our common stock held by new sac new sac exercised this right and on july 30 2003 we completed the secondary public offering of 69000000 of our common shares including 9000000 shares subject to the overallotment option all of which were sold by new sac as selling shareholder at a price of 1875 per share new sac received proceeds of approximately 13 billion after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately 39 million we incurred direct expenses aggregating approximately 1 million related to the offering new sac distributed its net proceeds to holders of its ordinary shares including approximately 245 million distributed to our officers and employees who hold ordinary shares of new sac 

  

results of operations 

  

we list in the tables below the historical consolidated and combined statements of operations in dollars and as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated 

  

   

charges recorded in the historical financial statements of us and our predecessor including charges related to the november 2000 transactions have been significant and impact the comparability of the results of operations of us and our predecessor for the periods presented and will impact the comparability of results for future periods for a description of these charges see item 6 selected financial data and the notes thereto 

  

in the discussions of “fiscal year 2002 results of operations” and “fiscal year 2001 results of operations” set forth below we refer to the revenue and cost of revenue data for fiscal year 2001 as “pro forma” for comparative purposes the pro forma revenue and cost of revenue data give effect to the november 2000 transactions as if they had occurred on july 1 2000 pro forma revenue for fiscal year 2001 is the sum of the historical revenue of our predecessor for the period from july 1 2000 through november 22 2000 and our historical revenue for the period from november 23 2000 through june 29 2001 pro forma cost of revenue for fiscal year 2001 is the sum of the historical cost of revenue of our predecessor for the period from july 1 2000 through november 22 2000 and our historical cost of revenue for the period from november 23 2000 through june 29 2001 as adjusted for 

  

   

   

   

fiscal year 2003 compared to fiscal year 2002 

  

revenue revenue for fiscal year 2003 was 6486 billion up 7 from 6087 billion in fiscal year 2002 the increase in revenue was primarily due to improved unit sales volume that was substantially offset by price erosion and a shift in mix to our personal storage products as compared to our enterprise storage products our unit shipments increased from 55 million units in fiscal year 2002 to 68 million units in fiscal year 2003 this increase in unit shipments was in both our personal storage products and our enterprise storage products and was due to an increase in the total available market especially for personal storage products as well as our share of the total available market we experienced strong growth in shipments to nongaming applications and we expect this trend will continue 

  

our overall average unit sales price for our rigid disc drive products was 93 94 97 and 97 for the first second third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2003 respectively average price erosion from fiscal year 2002 to fiscal year 2003 was approximately 14 price erosion in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2003 was the lowest we have experienced in eight years over the past few quarters including seasonally weak periods our industry has demonstrated operational discipline in managing production and inventory levels as a result it is our expectation that for the first quarter of fiscal year 2004 price erosion will be at the low end of the industry’s historical range 

  

during fiscal year 2003 we continued to maintain various sales programs aimed at increasing customer demand we exercise a considerable degree of judgment in formulating the underlying estimates related to distributor inventory levels sales program participation and customer claims submittals in determining the provision for such programs during fiscal year 2003 the total provision for sales programs recorded as contrarevenue was approximately 5 of gross revenue compared to 4 of gross revenue for fiscal year 2002 the increase in the provision for sales programs as a percentage of gross revenue in fiscal year 2003 as compared to fiscal year 2002 was a result of the increase in the portion of our revenue derived from sales to distributors 

  

cost of revenue cost of revenue for fiscal year 2003 was 4759 billion up 6 from 4494 billion in fiscal year 2002 gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2003 was 27 as compared with 26 for fiscal year 2002 the increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue resulted from overall costs decreasing at a higher rate than price erosion and was primarily due to improved absorption of fixed costs from increased unit sales volume ongoing cost savings as a result of our restructuring activities and our continued implementation of operational efficiencies also benefited our gross margins in addition gross margins were enhanced by improved yields for products introduced during the last half of fiscal year 2003 as well as a trend toward increased price stability 

  

product development expenses product development expenses decreased by 28 million or 4 for fiscal year 2003 when compared with fiscal year 2002 the decrease in product development expenses from fiscal year 2002 was primarily due to the nonrecurrence of deferred compensation charges incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2002 and our sale of xiotech in november 2002 these decreases were partially offset by increased expenses related to the opening of our new research facility in pittsburgh pennsylvania which included employee equipment and occupancy costs as well as several new product introductions and our development efforts in smaller than 35inch form factor rigid disc drives 

  

marketing and administrative expenses marketing and administrative expenses decreased by 141 million or 28 for fiscal year 2003 when compared with fiscal year 2002 the decrease in marketing and administrative expenses from fiscal year 2002 was primarily due to the nonrecurrence of deferred compensation charges of 112 million incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2002 and decreases of 48 million as a result of our sale of xiotech in november 2002 and 21 million in the provision for bad debts these decreases were partially offset by increases of 20 million in salaries and related costs 14 million in information technology expense and 7 million in depreciation expense 

  

restructuring during fiscal year 2003 we recorded 19 million in restructuring charges we also reduced a restructuring accrual previously recorded by our predecessor in fiscal year 1998 by 10 million due to a change in estimated lease obligations these combined actions resulted in a net restructuring charge of 9 million in fiscal year 2003 of the 19 million 17 million was incurred in the quarter ended september 27 2002 as a result of a restructuring plan which we refer to as the fiscal year 2003 restructuring plan established to continue the alignment of our global workforce and manufacturing capacity with existing and anticipated future market requirements primarily in our far east operations the restructuring charge was comprised of employee termination costs relating to a reduction in our workforce of approximately 3750 employees 3410 of whom had been terminated as of june 27 2003 we estimate that after completion of the restructuring activities contemplated by the fiscal year 2003 restructuring plan annual salary expense will be reduced by approximately 12 million excluding any savings in salary expense related to xiotech which was sold in november 2002 the fiscal year 2003 restructuring plan was substantially complete at june 27 2003 the remaining 2 million restructuring charge was incurred in the quarter ended june 27 2003 and was comprised of employee termination costs relating to a workforce reduction of approximately 686 employees in our thailand operations we estimate that after completion of these restructuring activities annual salary expense will be reduced by approximately 03 million these restructuring activities were completed in july 2003 

  

net other income expense net other expense decreased 104 million or 77 for fiscal year 2003 when compared with fiscal year 2002 the decrease in net other expense from fiscal year 2002 was primarily due to decreases of 93 million related to the debt refinancing charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2002 and a 30 million reduction in interest expense in fiscal year 2003 as a result of lower average outstanding debt and lower average interest rates paid because of our debt refinancing in may 2002 these decreases were partially offset by 10 million in writedowns of our investment in a private company in fiscal year 2003 and a decrease in interest income of 9 million resulting from lower average interest rates and a lower average balance in our interest bearing accounts 

  

income taxes we recorded a provision for income taxes of 19 million for the fiscal year ended june 27 2003 compared to a provision for income taxes of 86 million for the fiscal year ended june 28 2002 we are a foreign holding company incorporated in the cayman islands with foreign and us subsidiaries that operate in multiple taxing jurisdictions as a result our worldwide operating income is either subject to varying rates of tax or exempt from tax due to tax holidays that we operate under in malaysia singapore and thailand which are scheduled to expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2010 as of june 30 2003 our manufacturing operations in china no longer operate under a tax holiday our provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended june 27 2003 differs from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying a notional us 35 rate to income before income taxes primarily due to i the tax benefit related to the aforementioned tax holidays and ii the realization of various deferred tax assets that had previously been subject to a valuation allowance our provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended june 28 2002 differs from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying a notional us 35 rate to income before taxes primarily due to the net effect of i the tax benefit related to the aforementioned tax holidays and ii an increase in our valuation allowance for us deferred tax assets based on our foreign ownership structure and subject to potential future increases in our valuation allowance for domestic deferred tax assets we anticipate that our effective tax rate in future periods will generally be less than the us federal statutory rate dividend distributions received from our us subsidiaries may be subject to us withholding taxes when and if distributed deferred tax liabilities have not been recorded on unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as these earnings will not be subject to tax in the cayman islands or us federal income tax if remitted to the foreign parent holding company 

  

as of june 27 2003 we have recorded net deferred tax assets of 74 million the realization of which is primarily dependent on our ability to generate sufficient us taxable income in fiscal years 2004 and 2005 although realization is not assured management believes that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable however may increase or decrease in subsequent quarters when we reevaluate the underlying basis for our estimates of future us taxable income 

  

on july 31 2001 seagate delaware and the internal revenue service filed a settlement stipulation with the united states tax court in complete settlement of the remaining disputed tax matter reflected in the statutory notice of deficiency dated june 12 1998 the settlement stipulation is expressly contingent upon seagate delaware and the internal revenue service entering into a closing agreement in connection with certain tax matters arising in all or some part of the open tax years of seagate delaware and new sac the settlement remains before the joint committee on taxation for review the parties are in the process of incorporating comments from the joint committee on taxation into the parties’ settlement agreements the settlement and the anticipated execution of the closing agreements will not result in an additional provision for income taxes 

  

as of june 27 2003 and june 28 2002 accrued income taxes include 125 million for tax indemnification amounts due to veritas software corporation pursuant to the indemnification agreement between seagate delaware suez acquisition company and veritas software corporation the tax indemnification amount was recorded by us in connection with the purchase of the operating assets of seagate delaware by new sac and represents us tax liabilities previously accrued by seagate delaware for periods prior to the acquisition date of the operating assets certain of seagate delaware’s federal and state tax returns are under examination by tax authorities we believe that the 125 million tax indemnification amount is adequate to cover any final assessments that may result from these examinations the timing of the settlement of these examinations is uncertain to the extent the settlement of these examinations results in tax liabilities that are less than the 125 million indemnification amount the difference will be recorded as an income tax benefit and may significantly affect our effective tax rate for the period in which the settlement occurs 

  

certain of our foreign tax returns for various fiscal years are under examination by taxing authorities we believe that adequate amounts of tax have been provided for any final assessment that may result from these examinations 

  

fiscal year 2002 results of operations 

  

revenue revenue in fiscal year 2002 was 6087 billion up 2 from 5966 billion in pro forma fiscal year 2001 the increase in revenue was primarily due to improved unit sales volume and product mix that was substantially offset by price erosion our unit shipments increased from 43 million units in pro forma fiscal year 2001 to 55 million units in fiscal year 2002 this increase was primarily caused by market share gains driven by increased unit shipments of personal storage and enterprise storage rigid disc drive products to oems and continued growth in the rigid disc drive market for consumer electronics such as microsoft’s xbox we attribute these gains in market share primarily to the market acceptance of our 40 gigabyte personal storage disc drives and our 73 gigabyte enterprise storage disc drive each of which achieved volume production in the beginning of fiscal year 2002 in addition we gained a higher share of some of our oem customers’ rigid disc drive purchases due to favorable execution versus our competitors and due to industry consolidation our strategy to implement operational efficiencies has increased our manufacturing flexibility and in fiscal year 2002 this enabled us to take advantage of unforecasted customer demand and deliver products on short notice 

  

our overall average unit sales price for our rigid disc drive products was 118 109 111 and 100 for the first second third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2002 respectively average price erosion from pro forma fiscal year 2001 to fiscal year 2002 was approximately 20 price erosion during the period was driven primarily by the introduction of new higher storage capacity products due to the achievement of higher areal densities these new products require fewer discs and readwrite heads and therefore cost less to produce since they cost less to produce these products can be priced lower than would otherwise be possible and as a result drive down prices of older generation products competition also contributed to price erosion during this period the pricing environment during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2002 was extremely aggressive a condition that was exacerbated by competitors exiting the industry and liquidating their excess inventory 

  

during fiscal year 2002 we continued to maintain various sales programs aimed at increasing customer demand we exercise a considerable degree of judgment in formulating the underlying estimates related to distributor inventory levels sales program participation and customer claims submittals in determining the provision for such programs during fiscal year 2002 the total provision for sales programs recorded as contrarevenue was approximately 4 of total revenue compared to 3 of total revenue over each of the two previous fiscal years the increase in sales program expenses during fiscal year 2002 was due primarily to the higher cost of price protection programs which are based on estimates of distributor inventory levels and current and future price erosion rates as price erosion rates in the rigid disc drive industry escalated during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2002 the cost of price protection programs increased accordingly furthermore in the third quarter of fiscal year 2002 our north american distribution customers transitioned from a consignment model where the inventory is owned by us until it is sold by the distributor to a sellin model where the inventory is owned by the distributor during fiscal year 2002 this transition resulted in a onetime increase in total revenue operating income and net income of approximately 1 3 and 7 respectively in the third quarter of fiscal year 2002 this transition resulted in a onetime increase in total revenue operating income and net income of approximately 4 9 and 9 respectively because our north american distributors have transitioned to the sellin model the cost of our price protection programs may trend higher in future periods historically actual sales program costs have approximated the estimated cost of such programs recognized in our financial statements variances between actual and estimated costs of sales programs during each of the last three fiscal years have not been material due to our ongoing reviews of actual program expenses to ensure that accruals are continuously adjusted to approximate the actual costs of sales programs should actual sales program costs in any period differ significantly from estimated sales program costs either as a result of higher than expected rates of price erosion or otherwise our future results of operations could be materially affected 

  

cost of revenue cost of revenue for fiscal year 2002 was 4494 billion up 1 from 4457 billion for pro forma fiscal year 2001 gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2002 was 26 as compared with 25 for pro forma fiscal year 2001 as discussed in the paragraph above we experienced significant price erosion during the period this price erosion exerted substantial downward pressure on our gross margins however this downward pressure was more than offset by improved absorption of fixed costs from increased unit sales volume and a shift in mix to higher storage capacity products it was also offset by ongoing cost savings as a result of our restructuring activities and our program to implement operational efficiencies our restructuring activities during these periods were comprised of workforce reductions capacity reductions including closure of facilities or portions of facilities and the writeoff of excess equipment primarily in our far east operations in malaysia and thailand our cost structure decreased as a result of reductions in our total number of manufacturing facilities and headcount pursuant to our strategy to implement operational efficiencies we have increased the degree of automation in our manufacturing operations closed facilities reduced headcount and reconfigured our production lines to handle multiple products 

  

we exercise a considerable degree of judgment in formulating the underlying estimates used for product failure rates and trends estimated repair costs and return rates actual warranty costs during fiscal year 2002 represented approximately 1 of total revenue warranty costs have trended down over the last few years even though shipment volumes have increased these reductions are due to reduced warranty periods better product quality and more efficient repair operations historically actual warranty costs have approximated the estimated warranty costs recognized in our financial statements variances between actual and estimated warranty costs have not been material due to our ongoing reviews of return rates and repair costs to ensure that accruals are continuously adjusted to approximate actual warranty costs should actual warranty costs in any period differ significantly from estimated warranty costs our future results of operations could be materially affected 

  

operating expenses under the credit agreement governing our new senior secured credit facilities and the indenture governing our 8 senior notes the restrictions on our ability to make payments under our deferred compensation plan were substantially reduced in addition on june 19 2002 our board of directors accelerated vesting of all deferred compensation plan interests under the terms of the plan as a result it became probable that all of our obligations under the deferred compensation plan would be paid accordingly all of the remaining obligations under the deferred compensation plan totaling 147 million were accrued during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2002 together with the 32 million payment we made to participants in the deferred compensation plan in may 2002 our total deferred compensation expense recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2002 was 179 million before related tax benefits the income statement classification of the 179 million charge was as follows cost of revenue—38 million product development expenses—29 million marketing and administrative expenses—112 million 

  

in fiscal year 2002 product development expenses were reduced by our restructuring activities which resulted in a savings of 24 million in preproduction expenses and by the consolidation of our rigid disc drive design centers which resulted in a savings of 17 million as discussed above product development expenses and marketing and administrative expenses included deferred compensation expenses of 29 million and 112 million respectively 

  

nonoperating expenses net other expense includes 93 million of charges incurred as a result of our debt refinancing in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2002 see “liquidity and capital resources—the 2002 refinancing” interest income was lower in fiscal year 2002 as a result of lower average invested cash following the november 2000 transactions 

  

income taxes we recorded a provision for income taxes of 86 million for the fiscal year ended june 28 2002 our provision for income taxes differs from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying a notional us 35 tax rate to income before income taxes primarily due to i the net effect of the tax benefit related to income generated from our manufacturing plants located in china malaysia singapore and thailand that operate under tax holidays scheduled to expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2010 and ii an increase in our valuation allowance for us deferred tax assets 

  

as of june 28 2002 we have recorded net deferred tax assets of 58 million the realization of which is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient us taxable income in fiscal year 2003 although realization is not assured management believes that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable however could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future us domestic taxable income are reduced we will review our forecasts of us taxable income in each quarter of fiscal year 2003 to evaluate and record adjustments to our valuation allowance if required 

  

during the fiscal year ended june 28 2002 we reduced our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets arising as a result of the november 2000 transactions to reflect the realization of acquired tax benefits in our us income tax returns the acquired tax benefits realized in our us income tax returns exceeded the 104 million net carrying value of our longlived intangible assets recorded in connection with the purchase of the operating assets of seagate delaware in accordance with sfas 109 we reduced our longlived intangible assets acquired in the november 2000 transactions to zero as a result of the adjustment to the longlived intangible assets we will have no future depreciation and amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired in the november 2000 transactions 

  

on july 31 2001 seagate delaware and the internal revenue service filed a settlement stipulation with the united states tax court in complete settlement of the remaining disputed tax matters reflected in the statutory notice of deficiency dated june 12 1998 the settlement stipulation is expressly contingent upon seagate delaware and the internal revenue service entering into a closing agreement in connection with certain tax matters arising in all or some part of the open tax years of seagate delaware and new sac the settlement remains before the joint committee on taxation for review the parties are in the process of incorporating comments from the joint committee on taxation into the parties’ settlement agreements the settlement and the anticipated execution of the closing agreements will not result in an additional provision for income taxes 

  

certain of our us federal and state tax returns and foreign tax returns for various fiscal years are under examination by taxing authorities we believe that adequate amounts of tax have been provided for any final assessments that may result from these examinations 

  

as a result of the november 2000 transactions and the ensuing corporate structure we now consist of a foreign parent holding company with various us domestic and foreign affiliates we do not expect to be subject to us federal income taxes on dividends or other earnings distributions that we may receive from foreign subsidiaries dividend distributions by us subsidiaries to seagate technology hdd holdings may be subject to us withholding taxes if and when distributed a substantial portion of our manufacturing operations located in the far east currently operate free from tax under various tax holidays which are scheduled to expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2010 because of our foreign ownership structure and subject to potential future increases in our valuation allowance for us deferred tax assets we anticipate that our effective tax rate in future periods will generally be less than the us federal statutory rate 

  

fiscal year 2001 results of operations 

  

as a result of the closing of the november 2000 transactions we initiated our operations on november 23 2000 all results of operations prior to this date included in this prospectus are the results of operations of our predecessor the rigid disc drive and storage area networks business of seagate delaware the following discussion describes the results of operations of our predecessor for the period from july 1 2000 through november 22 2000 and our results of operations for the period from november 23 2000 through june 29 2001 

  

period from july 1 2000 to november 22 2000  during this period our predecessor’s ability to satisfy customer demand was constrained by a limited supply of certain electrical components from some of its external suppliers this resulted in lower than expected revenues during this period and the shifting of unit shipments that were expected during this period into the subsequent period as a result of the acceleration of stock options in connection with the november 2000 transactions compensation charges were allocated to cost of revenue product development expenses and marketing and administrative expenses in the amounts of 265 million 116 million and 185 million respectively additionally our predecessor incurred 77 million of marketing and administrative expenses related to administrative costs in connection with the november 2000 transactions during this period our predecessor recorded restructuring charges of 19 million to continue the alignment of its global workforce and manufacturing capacity with existing and anticipated future market requirements and net losses of 32 million relative to certain of its investments in equity securities 

  

seagate delaware recorded a benefit from income taxes of 206 million in this period the recorded benefit from income taxes differs from the benefit from income taxes that would be derived by applying the us federal statutory rate to the loss before income taxes primarily due to losses recorded in connection with the sale by seagate delaware of its operating assets located in the far east that were not deductible for us tax purposes and the writeoff of deferred tax assets that could not be recognized in the us federal and state tax returns of our predecessor for the taxable period ended november 22 2000 

  

as of november 22 2000 our predecessor’s foreign manufacturing subsidiaries had approximately 3050 billion of undistributed foreign earnings of which approximately 1722 billion were considered permanently reinvested offshore in connection with the sale of the operating assets of seagate delaware approximately 1650 billion of the unremitted foreign earnings were deemed to be distributed for us tax purposes to the us parent seagate delaware had previously recorded deferred income tax liabilities of approximately 542 million for its foreign earnings not considered permanently reinvested offshore the deferred tax liabilities were eliminated because the remaining unremitted earnings of our predecessor’s foreign subsidiaries will not be subject to us corporate level tax if remitted to us 

  

period from november 23 2000 to june 29 2001  during this period and particularly in the quarter ended june 29 2001 our revenue was negatively affected by an overall decline in demand for storage products due to reductions in global information technology spending partially offset by the abatement of supply constraints with respect to certain electrical components our gross margins were positively impacted by lower charges to cost of revenue for depreciation of approximately 140 million resulting from writedowns to fair value of our depreciable assets in connection with the november 2000 transactions our gross margins were negatively impacted as a result of a 131 million writeup of inventories to fair value pursuant to purchase accounting rules and the subsequent sale of that inventory during the period at the time of the closing of the november 2000 transactions we incurred marketing and administrative expenses of 40 million as a result of management and advisory fees paid to selected members of our sponsor group and we recorded a 52 million charge to operations for inprocess research and development we recorded additional restructuring charges of 66 million to continue the alignment of our global workforce and manufacturing capacity with existing and anticipated future market requirements in connection with the november 2000 transactions our cash balances declined resulting in a lower level of interest income in this period and our predecessor repaid its longterm debt and we incurred new debt at higher interest rates resulting in a subsequently higher level of interest expense 

  

we recorded a 9 million provision for income taxes for the period from november 23 2000 to june 29 2001 the 9 million provision for income taxes differs from the benefit from income taxes that would be derived by applying a notional us 35 tax rate to the loss before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of nondeductible charges related to the acquisition of the operating assets of seagate delaware an increase in our allowance for us deferred tax assets of certain subsidiaries and income generated from our manufacturing plants located in china malaysia singapore and thailand that operate under tax holidays scheduled to expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2010 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

the following is a discussion of our principal liquidity requirements and capital resources 

  

the 2002 refinancing 

  

in may 2002 we refinanced all of our then outstanding indebtedness this refinancing consisted of 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

in connection with the 2002 refinancing including the distribution of 32 million to deferred compensation plan participants in may 2002 we recognized 112 million of nonrecurring expenses in the quarter ended june 28 2002 this included 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

the borrowers under the new senior secured credit facility are seagate technology hdd holdings and seagate technology us holdings inc both of these companies are our whollyowned direct or indirect subsidiaries the new senior secured credit facilities are secured by a first priority pledge of substantially all the tangible and intangible assets of seagate technology hdd holdings and many of its subsidiaries as well as a pledge of the shares of seagate technology hdd holdings and many of its subsidiaries which in the case of nonus subsidiaries of seagate technology us holdings inc is limited to a pledge of 65 of the shares of those subsidiaries in each case subject to a number of exceptions seagate technology and many of the direct and indirect subsidiaries of seagate technology hdd holdings have guaranteed the obligations under the credit agreement that governs our new senior secured credit facilities 

  

the credit agreement that governs our senior secured credit facilities contains covenants that seagate technology hdd holdings our whollyowned subsidiary that operates our rigid disc drive business must satisfy in order to remain in compliance with the agreement these covenants require seagate technology hdd holdings among other things to maintain the following ratios 1 an interest expense coverage ratio for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters of at least 250 to 100 2 a fixed charge coverage ratio for any four consecutive fiscal quarters of at least a 125 to 100 for the period from june 30 2002 to june 29 2003 and b 150 to 100 for any period after june 30 2003 and 3 a net leverage ratio of not more than 150 to 100 as of the end of any fiscal quarter commencing on or after june 30 2002 we are currently in compliance with all of these covenants including the financial ratios that we are required to maintain 

  

the calculated financial ratios for the quarter ended june 27 2003 are as follows 

  

   

in connection with the new senior credit facility seagate technology hdd holdings and seagate technology us holdings inc entered into a new 150 million revolving credit facility under which 119 million was available to these entities for borrowing as of june 27 2003 although no borrowings have been drawn under this revolving credit facility to date we had 31 million of outstanding letters of credit and bankers’ guarantees under this facility as of june 27 2003 

  

on march 19 2002 we paid a distribution of 33 million to our shareholders including new sac to enable new sac to make a distribution of approximately 33 million to its shareholders which allowed members of our sponsor group to satisfy tax obligations 

  

on may 20 2002 we made a distribution to our shareholders including new sac to enable new sac to make a distribution to its preferred shareholders at approximately the same time distributions were made to participants in seagate technology hdd holdings’ deferred compensation plan the aggregate amount of the shareholder distribution was approximately 167 million and the aggregate amount of the deferred compensation plan distribution was approximately 32 million 

  

the net effect of the 2002 refinancing and the distribution to our shareholders and participants in seagate technology hdd holdings’ deferred compensation plan in may 2002 was a decrease in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 419 million consisting of an increase of 750 million from our senior secured credit facilities and the issuance of our 8 senior notes offset by 1169 billion of cash outlays 

  

on december 13 2002 immediately prior to the closing of our initial public offering we made a distribution of approximately 262 million to our thenoutstanding shareholders including new sac 

  

pursuant to our quarterly dividend policy we made distributions to our shareholders including new sac of approximately 13 million on each of february 28 2003 and may 23 2003 

  

the degree to which we are leveraged could materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for working capital capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances or other purposes and could make us more vulnerable to industry downturns and competitive pressures although we are currently not a party to any agreement or letter of intent with respect to potential investments in or acquisitions of complementary businesses products or technologies we may enter into these types of arrangements in the future which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all we will require substantial amounts of cash to fund scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness future capital expenditures and any increased working capital requirements if we are unable to meet our cash requirements out of existing cash or cash flow from operations we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain alternative financing on terms acceptable to us if at all 

  

discussion of cash flows 

  

at june 27 2003 our working capital was 919 million which included cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 1194 billion cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments increased 351 million from june 28 2002 to june 27 2003 this increase was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from the issuance of our common shares offset by distributions to shareholders and investments in property equipment and leasehold improvements 

  

cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended june 27 2003 was 882 million and consisted primarily of net income plus depreciation and amortization partially offset by payments of 147 million to participants in our deferred compensation plan 

  

during fiscal year 2003 we invested approximately 516 million in property equipment and leasehold improvements the 516 million investment comprised 

  

   

   

   

   

   

in fiscal year 2004 we anticipate that our investment in property and equipment will increase to approximately 650 million to 700 million this increase over our historic level is a result of our planned investment to expand our media production facility in singapore we expect our investment in subsequent years to return to budgeted levels of up to approximately 600 million per year we plan to finance these investments from existing cash balances and cash flows from operations 

  

during the fiscal year ended june 28 2002 we invested approximately 538 million in property equipment and leasehold improvements the 538 million investment comprised 

  

   

   

   

   

for the fiscal year ended june 28 2002 cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments decreased 66 million the primary contributors to the decrease were the refinancing of all of our outstanding indebtedness expenditures for property equipment and leasehold improvements and shareholder distributions these uses of cash were substantially offset by cash provided by operating activities during the quarter ended june 28 2002 we repaid 883 million of longterm debt and refinanced it with 750 million of new longterm debt cash used to acquire property equipment and leasehold improvements was 540 million for fiscal year 2002 shareholder distributions included 33 million paid to seagate delaware’s former stockholders in connection with the final accounting for the november 2000 transactions and 167 million paid to shareholders of seagate technology consisting of new sac and certain employees cash provided by operating activities was 905 million and consisted primarily of net income plus depreciation and amortization and an increase in accounts payable

net cash provided by used in operating activities was 882 million for fiscal year 2003 905 million for fiscal year 2002 269 million for the period from november 23 2000 to june 29 2001 and 121 million for the period from july 1 2000 to november 22 2000 net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2003 was primarily attributable to net income as adjusted for noncash expenses for depreciation and amortization and deferred compensation payments net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2002 was primarily attributable to net income as adjusted for noncash expenses for depreciation and amortization deferred income taxes deferred compensation and the writeoff of debt issuance costs and as adjusted to reclassify the cash payment for the redemption premium on the 12½ senior subordinated notes to net cash used in financing activities net cash provided by operating activities during the period from november 23 2000 to june 29 2001 was primarily attributable to a net loss which was more than offset by net noncash charges such as depreciation amortization and inprocess research and development and a decrease in net operating assets net cash provided by operating activities during the period from july 1 2000 to november 22 2000 was primarily attributable to a net loss which was more than offset by net noncash charges such as depreciation amortization deferred income taxes and compensation expense related to the acceleration of vesting of stock options in connection with the november 2000 transactions 

  

net cash provided by used in investing activities was 754 for fiscal year 2003 610 million for fiscal year 2002 1140 billion for the period from november 23 2000 to june 29 2001 and 829 million for the period from july 1 2000 to november 22 2000 net cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2003 was primarily attributable to expenditures for property equipment and leasehold improvements and the purchases of shortterm investments in excess of maturities net cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2002 was primarily attributable to expenditures for property equipment and leasehold improvements net cash used in investing activities during the period from november 23 2000 to june 29 2001 was primarily used to acquire property equipment and leasehold improvements the purchase of the rigid disc drive and storage area networks divisions of our predecessor and purchases of shortterm investments in excess of maturities net cash provided by investment activities during the period from july 1 2000 to november 22 2000 was primarily attributable to net sales and maturities of investments offset by expenditures for property equipment and leasehold improvements and the establishment of a restricted cash account related to the transaction with veritas

liquidity sources and cash requirements and commitments 

  

consistent with our quarterly dividend policy in effect at such time our board of directors declared a quarterly distribution of 003 per share or approximately 13 million which was paid on may 23 2003 to all common shareholders of record as of may 9 2003 including new sac 

  

on june 27 2003 our board of directors amended our quarterly dividend policy and pursuant to our amended dividend policy we expect to pay our shareholders a quarterly distribution of up to 004 per share 016 annually so long as the aggregate amount of the distributions does not exceed 50 of our consolidated net income for the quarter in which the distributions are declared our ability to continue to pay quarterly distributions will be subject to among other things general business conditions within the rigid disc drive industry our financial results the impact of paying distributions on our credit ratings and legal and contractual restrictions on the payment of distributions by our subsidiaries to us or by us to our shareholders including restrictions imposed by the covenants contained in the indenture governing our senior notes on july 14 2003 our board of directors declared a quarterly distribution of 004 per share to be paid on or before august 22 2003 to our shareholders of record as of august 8 2003 

  

our principal sources of liquidity as of june 27 2003 consisted of 1 1194 billion in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments 2 a 150 million revolving credit facility of which 31 million had been used for outstanding letters of credit and bankers’ guarantees as of june 27 2003 and 3 cash we expect to generate from operations during this fiscal year 

  

since the closing of the november 2000 transactions our principal liquidity requirements have been to service our debt and meet our working capital research and development and capital expenditure needs in addition in the second half of fiscal year 2002 and through fiscal year 2003 we made distributions to our shareholders 

  

we believe that our sources of cash will be sufficient to fund our operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months our ability to fund these requirements and comply with the financial covenants under our debt agreements will depend on our future operations performance and cash flow and is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial business and other factors some of which are beyond our control in addition as part of our strategy we intend to selectively pursue strategic alliances acquisitions and investments that are complementary to our business any material future acquisitions alliances or investments will likely require additional capital we cannot assure you that additional funds from available sources will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 

  

our contractual cash obligations and commitments as of june 27 2003 have been summarized in the table below in millions 

  

   

under operating leases in the table above we have included total future minimum rent expense under noncancelable leases for both occupied and abandoned facilities rent expense is shown net of sublease income 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

the methods estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements the sec has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are highly uncertain at the time of estimation based on this definition our most critical policies include establishment of sales program accruals establishment of warranty accruals and valuation of deferred tax assets below we discuss these policies further as well as the estimates and judgments involved we also have other key accounting policies and accounting estimates relating to uncollectible customer accounts and valuation of inventory we believe that these other accounting policies and other accounting estimates either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective or it is less likely that they would have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period 

  

establishment of sales program accruals we establish certain distributor sales programs aimed at increasing customer demand these programs are typically related to a distributor’s level of sales order size and advertising or point of sale activity we provide for these contrarevenues at the time that revenue is recorded based on estimated requirements these estimates are based on various factors including estimated future price erosion customer orders and sellthrough levels program participation and customer claim submittals significant variations in any of these factors could have a material effect on our operating results 

  

in the third quarter of fiscal year 2002 our north american distribution customers transitioned from a consignment model under which we recognized revenue when distributors sold our products through to their customers to a sellin model under which we recognize revenue when our products are sold to distributors this transition resulted from changes in our contractual arrangements with our north american distribution customers as a result of these changes title and risk of loss now pass to those distributors at the time we ship our products to them as compared to our former contractual arrangements under which title and risk of loss remained with us until our products were sold by the distributors we effected the transition to a sellin model with respect to our north american distribution customers in an effort to improve our competitive position within the rigid disc drive industry by increasing the incentive of those distributors to sell our products through to their customers although a limited right of return exists with respect to sales to our north american distribution customers requiring us to make estimates of future returns we believe that these estimates are reasonably accurate due to the short time period during which our north american distribution customers can return our products the limitations placed on their right to make returns our long history of conducting business with distributors on a sellin basis in asia and europe the nature of our historical relationships with our north american distribution customers and the daily reporting procedures through which we monitor inventory levels and sales to endusers however the failure of our distribution customers to sell our products to endusers or our failure to accurately predict the level of future returns by our distribution customers could have a material impact on our results of operations in future periods 

  

establishment of warranty accruals we estimate probable product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized we generally warrant our products for a period of one to five years we use estimated repair or replacement costs and use statistical modeling to estimate product return rates in order to determine our warranty obligation we exercise judgement in determining the underlying estimates should actual experience in any period differ significantly from our estimates our future results of operations could be materially affected the actual results with respect to warranty expenditures could have a material adverse effect on us if the actual rate of unit failure is greater than what we used in estimating the warranty expense accrual 

  

valuation of deferred tax assets  the recording of our deferred tax assets each period depends primarily on our ability to generate current and future taxable income in the united states each period we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and we adjust the valuation allowance so that we record net deferred tax assets only to the extent that we conclude it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

in july 2001 the financial accounting standards board or fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards or sfas no 141 “business combinations” “sfas 141” and sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas 142” the provisions of sfas 141 apply to all business combinations initiated after june 30 2001 the adoption of sfas 141 had no effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations in fiscal year 2002 sfas 142 requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized however these assets must be reviewed at least annually for impairment intangible assets with finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over their respective useful lives the provisions of sfas 142 are effective for our fiscal year 2003 the adoption of sfas 142 had no impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations in fiscal year 2003 

  

in october 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” “sfas 144” sfas 144 amends existing accounting guidance on asset impairment and provides an accounting model for longlived assets to be disposed of we adopted sfas 144 in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2003 the adoption of sfas 144 did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

  

in july 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” “sfas 146” sfas 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies eitf issue no 943 “liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring” sfas 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred rather than when the exit or disposal plan is approved the adoption of sfas 146 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

  

in november 2002 the fasb issued interpretation no 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” “fin 45” the interpretation will significantly change current practice in the accounting for and disclosure of guarantees the interpretation requires certain guarantees to be recorded at fair value which is different from current practice which is generally to record a liability only when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable as those terms are defined in fasb statement no 5 “accounting for contingencies” the interpretation also requires a guarantor to make significant new disclosures even when the likelihood of making any payments under the guarantee is remote which is another change from current practice we adopted the disclosure requirements of fin 45 in the quarter ended december 27 2002 see note 14 product warranty we adopted the initial recognition and measurement provisions of fin 45 prospectively in the quarter ended march 28 2003 

  

in december 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation transition and disclosure” “sfas 148” sfas 148 amends sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” “sfas 123” to provide alternative methods of transition to sfas 123’s fair value method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation sfas 148 also amends the disclosure provisions of sfas 123 and apb opinion no 28 “interim financial reporting” to require disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies of the effects of an entity’s accounting policy with respect to stockbased employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements while sfas 148 does not amend sfas 123 to require companies to account for employee stock options using the fair value method the disclosure provisions of sfas 148 are applicable to all companies with stockbased employee compensation regardless of whether they account for the compensation using the fair value method of sfas 123 or the intrinsic value method of apbo 25 we adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas 148 in the quarter ended march 28 2003 and we will continue to use the intrinsic value method described in abpo 25 in accounting for the fair value of stock awards issued to employees 

  

in january 2003 the fasb issued fin 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 51” “fin 46” fin 46 requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parities fin 46 is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january 31 2003 for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february 1 2003 the provisions of fin 46 must be applied beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year 2004 we do not believe that the adoption of fin 46 will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

  

in april 2003 the fasb issued sfas no 149 “amendment of statement 133 on derivative instruments and hedging activities” “fas 149” which amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under fas 133 fas 149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june 30 2003 except for the provisions that were cleared by the fasb in prior pronouncements we do not expect the provision of this statement to have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position 

  

in may 2003 the fasb issued sfas no 150 “accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity” this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures in its statement of financial position certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity in accordance with the standard financial instruments that embody obligations for the issuer are required to be classified as liabilities this statement shall be effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may 31 2003 and otherwise shall be effective beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year 2004 we do not expect the provision of this statement to have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position 

  

risk factors 

  

risks related to our business 

  

competition—our industry is highly competitive and our products have experienced significant price erosion 

  

even during periods when demand is stable the rigid disc drive industry is intensely competitive and vendors typically experience substantial price erosion over the life of a product our competitors have historically offered existing products at lower prices as part of a strategy to gain or retain market share and customers and we expect these practices to continue we may need to reduce our prices to retain our market share which could adversely affect our results of operations based on our recent experience in the industry with respect to new product introductions we believe that the rate of increase in areal density or the storage capacity per square inch on a disc is slowing from its previous levels this trend may contribute to increased average price erosion to the extent that historical price erosion patterns continue product life cycles are lengthened and we are unable to offset these factors with new product introductions at higher average prices as a result our results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

moreover a significant portion of our success over the past two fiscal years is a result of increasing our market share at the expense of our competitors our current market share may be negatively affected by our customers’ preference to diversify their sources of supply or if they decide to meet their requirements by manufacturing rigid disc drives themselves particularly in the enterprise sector any significant increase in market share by one of our competitors would likely result in a decline in our market share which could adversely affect our results of operations 

  

principal competitors—we compete with both captive manufacturers who do not depend solely on sales of rigid disc drives to maintain their profitability and independent manufacturers whose primary focus is producing technologically advanced rigid disc drives 

  

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience intense competition from a number of domestic and foreign companies including other independent rigid disc drive manufacturers and large captive manufacturers such as 

  

   

the term “independent” in this context refers to manufacturers that primarily produce rigid disc drives as a standalone product and the term “captive” refers to rigid disc drive manufacturers that produce complete computer or other systems that contain rigid disc drives or other information storage products captive manufacturers are formidable competitors because they have the ability to determine pricing for complete systems without regard to the margins on individual components because components other than rigid disc drives generally contribute a greater portion of the operating margin on a complete computer system than do rigid disc drives captive manufacturers do not necessarily need to realize a profit on the rigid disc drives included in a computer system and as a result may be willing to sell rigid disc drives to third parties at very low margins many captive manufacturers are also formidable competitors because they have more substantial resources than we do to the extent we are not successful competing with captive or independent rigid disc drive manufacturers our results of operations will be adversely affected 

  

in addition in response to customer demand for highquality highvolume and lowcost rigid disc drives manufacturers of rigid disc drives have had to develop large in some cases global production facilities with highly developed technological capabilities and internal controls the development of large production facilities and industry consolidation can contribute to the intensification of competition we also face indirect competition from present and potential customers who evaluate from time to time whether to manufacture their own rigid disc drives or other information storage products 

  

industry consolidation—consolidation among captive manufacturers may serve to increase their resources and improve their access to customers thereby making them more formidable competitors 

  

consolidation among captive manufacturers may provide them with competitive advantages over independent manufacturers including us for example ibm recently merged its disc drive business with the disc drive business of hitachi through the formation of hitachi global storage technologies a separate company that currently is 70 owned by hitachi as a part of this transaction each of ibm and hitachi has agreed to multiyear supply commitments with the new company because ibm is one of our most significant customers and hitachi is one of our most significant competitors there is a significant risk that ibm will decrease the number of rigid disc drives purchased from us and increase the number purchased from the new company moreover economies of scale and the combination of the two companies’ technological capabilities particularly in the enterprise sector of our industry could make the new company a more formidable competitor than ibm or hitachi operating alone 

  

volatility of quarterly results—our quarterly operating results fluctuate significantly from period to period and this may cause our stock price to decline 

  

in the past our quarterly revenue and operating results fluctuated significantly from period to period we expect this fluctuation to continue for a variety of reasons including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

as a result we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful and that these comparisons may not be an accurate indicator of our future performance our operating results in one or more future quarters may fail to meet the expectations of investment research analysts or investors which could cause an immediate and significant decline in the trading price of our common shares 

  

industry demand—slowdown in demand for computer systems and storage subsystems has caused and may continue to cause a decline in demand for our products 

  

our rigid disc drives are components in computers computer systems and storage subsystems the demand for these products has been volatile in a weak economy consumer spending tends to decline and retail demand for pcs tends to decrease as does enterprise demand for computer systems and storage subsystems currently demand for rigid disc drives in the enterprise sector is being adversely impacted as a result of the weakened economy and because enterprises have shifted their focus from making new equipment purchases to more efficiently using their existing information technology infrastructure through among other things adopting new storage architectures unexpected slowdowns in demand for computer systems and storage subsystems have generally caused sharp declines in demand for rigid disc drive products during economic slowdowns such as the one that began in 2001 our industry has experienced periods in which the supply of rigid disc drives has exceeded demand 

  

additional causes of declines in demand for our products in the past have included announcements or introductions of major operating system or semiconductor improvements we believe these announcements and introductions have from time to time caused consumers to defer their purchases and made inventory obsolete whenever an oversupply of rigid disc drives causes participants in our industry to have higher than anticipated inventory levels we experience even more intense price competition from other rigid disc drive manufacturers than usual 

  

seasonality—because we experience seasonality in the sales of our products our results of operations will generally be adversely impacted during the summer months 

  

because sales of computer systems storage subsystems and consumer electronics tend to be seasonal we expect to continue to experience seasonality in our business as we respond to variations in our customers’ demand for rigid disc drives in particular we anticipate that sales of our products will continue to be lower during the summer months than the rest of the year in the desktop computer notebook computer and consumer electronics sectors of our business this seasonality is partially attributable to our customers’ increased sales during the winter holiday season of pcs and consumer electronics in the enterprise sector of our business our sales are seasonal because of the capital budgeting and purchasing cycles of our end users because our working capital needs peak during periods in which we are increasing production in anticipation of orders that have not yet been received our operating results will fluctuate seasonally even if the forecasted demand for our products proves accurate furthermore it is difficult for us to evaluate the degree to which this seasonality may affect our business in future periods because our overall growth may have reduced the impact of this seasonality in recent periods 

  

difficulty in predicting quarterly demand—if we fail to predict demand accurately for our products in any quarter we may not be able to recapture the cost of our investments 

  

the rigid disc drive industry operates on quarterly purchasing cycles with much of the order flow in any given quarter coming at the end of that quarter our manufacturing process requires us to make significant productspecific investments in inventory in each quarter for that quarter’s production because we typically receive the bulk of our orders late in a quarter after we have made our investments there is a risk that our orders will not be sufficient to allow us to recapture the costs of our investment before the products resulting from that investment have become obsolete we cannot assure you that we will be able to accurately predict demand in the future other factors that may negatively impact our ability to recapture the cost of investments in any given quarter include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

variable product life cycles—the variability of product life cycles can make planning product transitions difficult 

  

historically the rate of increase of areal density has grown rapidly however recently this rate of increase is slowing higher areal densities mean that fewer readwrite heads and rigid discs are required to achieve a given rigid disc drive storage capacity in addition advances in computer hardware and software have led to the demand for successive generations of storage products with increased storage capacity andor improved performance and reliability as a result product life cycles shortened because of recent rapid increases in areal density the introduction of new rigid disc drives requires us to engage in new product qualifications with our customers and we expect to engage in several competitive product qualifications during the balance of this calendar year particularly with respect to our notebook products and on an ongoing basis in future years short product cycles make it more difficult to recover the cost of product development because those costs must be recovered over increasingly shorter periods of time during the life cycles of products 

  

in contrast to historical trends based on our recent experience in the industry with respect to new product introductions we believe that the current rate of increase in areal density is slowing from the rate of the last several years we believe that this slowdown in the rate of increase in areal density will continue until a significant advance in technology for the electronic storage of data such as perpendicular recording technology becomes commercially available when the rate of increase in areal density slows it may contribute to increased average price erosion to the extent historical price erosion patterns continue product life cycles are lengthened and our ability to introduce new products at higher prices is limited in addition the variability of product life cycles can make planning product transitions more difficult to the extent that we prematurely discontinue a product or do not timely introduce new products our operating results may be adversely affected 

  

new product offerings—market acceptance of new product introductions cannot be accurately predicted and our results of operations will suffer if there is less demand for our new products than is anticipated 

  

we are continually developing new products in the hope that we will be able to introduce technologically advanced rigid disc drives into the marketplace ahead of our competitors the success of our new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors including market acceptance our ability to manage the risks associated with product transitions the effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand and the risk that our new products will have quality problems or other defects in the early stages of introduction that were not anticipated in the design of those products accordingly we cannot accurately determine the ultimate effect that our new products will have on our sales or results of operations 

  

in addition the success of our new product introductions is dependent upon our ability to qualify as a primary source of supply with our original equipment manufacturer or oem customers in order for our products to be considered by our customers for qualification we must be among the leaders in timetomarket with those new products once a product is accepted for qualification testing any failure or delay in the qualification process can result in our losing sales to that customer until new products are introduced the effect of missing a product qualification opportunity is magnified by the limited number of highvolume oems these risks are further magnified because we expect competitive pressures to result in declining sales and declining gross margins on our current generation products we cannot assure you that we will be among the leaders in timetomarket with new products or that we will be able to successfully qualify new products with our customers in the future 

  

smaller form factor rigid disc drives—if we do not successfully market smaller form factor rigid disc drives our business may suffer 

  

increases in sales of notebook computers and in areal density are resulting in a shift to smaller form factor rigid disc drives for an expanding number of applications including pcs enterprise storage applications and consumer electronics these applications have typically used rigid disc drives with a 35inch form factor which we currently manufacture notebook computers typically use 25inch form factor rigid disc drives although we are currently shipping notebook drives to oems we currently have not completed qualification programs with a number of oems which are material to the success of these products furthermore our announced products only address a limited portion of the existing notebook market we cannot assure you that we will receive additional qualifications or that we will be able to successfully compete in the market for smaller form factor rigid disc drives if we do not suitably adapt our technology and product offerings to successfully develop and introduce smaller form factor rigid disc drives customers may decrease the amounts of our products that they purchase 

  

importance of timetomarket—our operating results depend on our being among the firsttomarket and achieving sufficient production volume with our new products 

  

to achieve consistent success with our oem customers we must be an early provider of new types of rigid disc drives featuring leading highquality technology our operating results in the past two years have substantially depended and in the future will substantially depend upon our ability to be among the firsttomarket with new product offerings our market share will be adversely affected which would harm our operating results if we fail to 

  

   

   

   

   

if delivery of our products is delayed our oem customers may use our competitors’ products to meet their production requirements if the delay of our products causes delivery of those oems’ computer systems into which our products are integrated to be delayed consumers and businesses may purchase comparable products from the oems’ competitors 

  

moreover we face the related risk that consumers and businesses may wait to make their purchases if they want to buy a new product that has been shipped or announced but not yet released if this were to occur we may be unable to sell our existing inventory of products that may have become less efficient and cost effective compared to new products as a result even if we are among the firsttomarket with a given product subsequent introductions or announcements by our competitors of new products could cause us to lose revenue and not achieve a positive return on our investment in existing products and inventory 

  

importance of reducing operating costs—if we do not reduce our operating expenses we will not be able to compete effectively in our industry 

  

our strategy involves to a substantial degree increasing revenue while at the same time reducing operating expenses in furtherance of this strategy we have engaged in ongoing companywide manufacturing efficiency activities intended to increase productivity and reduce costs these activities have included closures and transfers of facilities significant personnel reductions and efforts to increase automation we cannot assure you that our efforts will result in the increased profitability cost savings or other benefits that we expect moreover the reduction of personnel and closure of facilities may adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in required volumes to meet customer demand and may result in other disruptions that affect our products and customer service in addition the transfer of manufacturing capacity of a product to a different facility frequently requires qualification of the new facility by some of our oem customers we cannot assure you that these activities and transfers will be implemented on a costeffective basis without delays or disruption in our production and without adversely affecting our customer relationships and results of operations 

  

new product development and technological change—if we do not develop products in time to keep pace with technological changes our operating results will be adversely affected 

  

our customers have demanded new generations of rigid disc drive products as advances in computer hardware and software have created the need for improved storage products with features such as increased storage capacity improved performance and reliability of smaller form factors we and our competitors have developed improved products and we will need to continue to do so in the future for fiscal years 2002 and 2003 we had product development expenses of 698 million and 670 million respectively we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully complete the design or introduction of new products in a timely manner that we will be able to manufacture new products in sufficient volumes with acceptable manufacturing yields that we will be able to successfully market these new products or that these products will perform to specifications on a longterm basis 

  

when we develop new products with higher capacity and more advanced technology our operating results may decline because the increased difficulty and complexity associated with producing these products increases the likelihood of reliability quality or operability problems if our products suffer increases in failures are of low quality or are not reliable customers may reduce their purchases of our products and our manufacturing rework and scrap costs and service and warranty costs may increase in addition a decline in the reliability of our products may make us less competitive as compared with other rigid disc drive manufacturers 

  

impact of technological change—increases in the areal density of disc drives may outpace customers’ demand for storage capacity 

  

the rate of increase in areal density or storage capacity per square inch on a disc may be greater than the increase in our customers’ demand for aggregate storage capacity as a result our customers’ storage capacity needs may be satisfied with fewer rigid disc drives in addition as areal densities have increased delivering products with the reliability and performance characteristics as well as manufacturing yields of prior product generations has become increasingly difficult this may cause our oem customers to delay transitions to our newer product offerings these factors could decrease our sales especially when combined with continued price erosion which could adversely affect our results of operations 

  

changes in information storage products—future changes in the nature of information storage products may reduce demand for traditional rigid disc drive products 

  

we expect that in the future new personal computing devices and products will be developed some of which such as internet appliances may not contain a rigid disc drive while we are investing development resources in designing information storage products for new applications it is too early to assess the impact of these new applications on future demand for rigid disc drive products we cannot assure you that we will be successful in developing other information storage products in addition there are currently no widely accepted standards in various technical areas that may be important to the future of our business including the developing sector of intelligent storage solutions products using alternative technologies such as semiconductor memory optical storage and other storage technologies could become a significant source of competition to particular applications of our products 

  

for example semiconductor memory is much faster than rigid disc drives but currently is volatile in that it is subject to loss of data in the event of power failure and is much more costly than rigid disc drive technologies flash eeprom a nonvolatile semiconductor memory is currently much more costly than rigid disc drive technologies and while it has higher read performance than rigid disc drives it has lower write performance flash eeprom could become competitive in the near future for applications requiring less storage capacity than is required in traditional markets for our products 

  

high fixed costs—our vertical integration strategy entails a high level of fixed costs 

  

our vertical integration strategy entails a high level of fixed costs and requires a high volume of production and sales to be successful during periods of decreased production these high fixed costs have had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition for example in 1998 our predecessor experienced a significant decrease in the demand for its products and because our predecessor was unable to adequately reduce its costs to offset this decrease in revenue its gross and operating margins suffered in addition a strategy of vertical integration has in the past and could in the future delay our ability to introduce products containing marketleading technology because we may not have developed the technology and source of components for our products and do not have access to external sources of supply without incurring substantial costs 

  

research and development expenses represent a significant portion of our fixed costs as part of our vertical integration strategy we explore a broad range of ways to improve rigid disc drives as well as possible alternatives to rigid disc drives for storing and retrieving electronic data if we fail to develop new technologies in a timely manner and our competitors succeed in doing so our ability to sell our products could be significantly diminished conversely if we over invest in technologies that can never be profitably manufactured and marketed our results of operations could suffer by way of example we have incurred expenses in exploring new technologies for storing electronic data including perpendicular recording technology which involves a different orientation for the magnetic field than is currently used in rigid disc drives and heat assisted magnetic recording technology which uses heat generated by a laser to improve storage capacity we believe these new technologies could significantly improve the storage capacity of rigid disc drives over the longterm to date we have not yet developed a commercial product based on these technologies furthermore based on our recent experience in the industry with respect to new product introductions we believe that the rate of increase of areal density is slowing as compared to its previous levels which has lengthened the life cycles of existing products and may further postpone returns on our investments in new technologies if we have invested too much in new technologies our results of operations could be adversely affected in addition as we replace our existing assets with new higher cost assets we expect that our depreciation expense will increase which will contribute to our high level of fixed costs and reduce our earnings this could cause the market price of our common shares to decline 

  

dependence on supply of equipment and components—if we experience shortages or delays in the receipt of critical equipment or components necessary to manufacture our products we may suffer lower operating margins production delays and other material adverse effects 

  

the cost quality and availability of some equipment and components used to manufacture rigid disc drives and other information storage products are critical to the successful manufacture of these products the equipment we use to manufacture our products is frequently custom made and comes from a few suppliers particularly important components include readwrite heads recording media applicationspecific integrated circuits or asics spindle motors and printed circuit boards we rely on sole suppliers and a limited number of suppliers for some of these components including the readwrite heads and recording media that we do not manufacture asics spindle motors and printed circuit boards in the past we have experienced increased costs and production delays when we were unable to obtain the necessary equipment or sufficient quantities of some components and have been forced to pay higher prices for some components that were in short supply in the industry in general 

  

for example during the months preceding the november 2000 transactions seagate delaware’s ability to satisfy customer demand was constrained by a limited supply of electrical components from external suppliers due to the recent downturn in the economy in general and in the technology sector of the economy in particular the rigid disc drive industry has experienced economic pressure which has resulted in consolidation among component manufacturers and may result in some component manufacturers exiting the industry or not making sufficient investments in research to develop new components these events could affect our ability to obtain critical components for our products which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and prospects 

  

if there is a shortage of or delay in supplying us with critical components then 

  

   

   

   

   

we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain critical components in a timely and economic manner or at all 

  

dependence on key customers—we may be adversely affected by the loss of or reduced delayed or cancelled purchases by one or more of our larger customers 

  

for fiscal years 2002 and 2003 our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 63 and 63 respectively of our rigid disc drive revenue compaq computer corporation together with hewlettpackard accounted for approximately 20 of our rigid disc drive revenue for fiscal year 2002 and hewlettpackard accounted for approximately 18 of our rigid disc drive revenue for fiscal year 2003 if any of our key customers were to significantly reduce their purchases from us our results of operations would be adversely affected while sales to major customers may vary from period to period a major customer that permanently discontinues or significantly reduces its relationship with us could be difficult to replace in line with industry practice new customers usually require that we pass a lengthy and rigorous qualification process at the customer’s cost accordingly it may be difficult for us to attract new major customers 

  

customer concentration—consolidation among our customers could cause sales of our products to decline 

  

mergers acquisitions consolidations or other significant transactions involving our customers generally entail risks to our business for example ibm which is one of our key customers recently merged its disc drive business with the disc drive business of hitachi through the formation of a new company with which ibm has entered into a multiyear supply agreement as a result ibm may decrease its purchases from us in favor of this new company if a significant transaction involving any of our key customers results in the loss of or reduction in purchases by these key customers it could have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and prospects 

  

oem purchase agreements—our oem customers are not obligated to purchase our products 

  

typically our oem purchase agreements permit oems to cancel orders and reschedule delivery dates without significant penalties in the past orders from many of our oems were cancelled and delivery schedules were delayed as a result of changes in the requirements of the oems’ customers these order cancellations and delays in delivery schedules have had a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the past and may do so again in the future our oems and distributors typically furnish us with nonbinding indications of their near term requirements with product deliveries based on weekly confirmations if actual orders from distributors and oems decrease from their nonbinding forecasts these variances could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and prospects 

  

economic risks associated with international operations—our international operations subject us to risks related to currency exchange fluctuations longer payment cycles for sales in foreign countries seasonality and disruptions in foreign markets tariffs and duties price controls potential adverse tax consequences increased costs our customers’ credit and access to capital and healthrelated risks 

  

we have significant operations in foreign countries including manufacturing facilities sales personnel and customer support operations for fiscal years 2002 and 2003 approximately 31 and 31 respectively of our rigid disc drive revenue were from sales to customers located in europe and approximately 30 and 35 respectively were from sales to customers located in the far east we have manufacturing facilities in china malaysia northern ireland singapore and thailand in addition to those in the united states a substantial portion of our desktop rigid disc drive assembly occurs in our facility in china 

  

our international operations are subject to economic risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries including the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

political risks associated with international operations—our international operations subject us to risks related to political unrest and terrorism 

  

we have manufacturing facilities in parts of the world that periodically experience political unrest this could disrupt our ability to manufacture important components as well as cause interruptions andor delays in our ability to ship components to other locations for continued manufacture and assembly any such delays or interruptions could result in delays in our ability to fill orders and have an adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition us and international responses to the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 the ongoing hostilities in afghanistan and iraq and the risk of hostilities with north korea could exacerbate these risks 

  

legal and operational risks associated with international operations—our international operations subject us to risks related to staffing and management legal and regulatory requirements and the protection of intellectual property 

  

operating outside of the united states creates difficulties associated with staffing and managing our international manufacturing facilities complying with local legal and regulatory requirements and protecting our intellectual property we cannot assure you that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with applicable customs currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which we may be subject we also cannot assure you that these laws will not be modified 

  

conflicts of interest of our directors and officers—our directors and executive officers may have conflicts of interest because of their ownership of capital stock of and their employment with our parent company and our affiliates 

  

many of our directors and executive officers hold ordinary shares of our parent company new sac and some of them hold shares of capital stock and options to purchase the capital stock of our affiliate crystal decisions inc a business intelligence software solutions company ownership of the capital stock of our parent company and our affiliates by our directors and officers could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest when our directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for us and for new sac or our affiliates 

  

some of our directors also serve on the board of new sac and on the boards of certance holdings a tape drive company and crystal decisions a software company both of which are owned by new sac several of our executive officers also serve as officers andor directors of those entities as well as of other affiliates of ours in view of these overlapping relationships conflicts of interest may exist or arise with respect to existing and future business dealings including the relative commitment of time and energy by our directors and officers to us and to our parent company and affiliates potential acquisitions of businesses or properties and other business opportunities the issuance of additional securities the election of new or additional directors and the payment of distributions by us we cannot assure you that any conflicts of interest will be resolved in our favor 

  

risks associated with future acquisitions—we may not be able to identify suitable strategic alliance acquisition or investment opportunities or successfully acquire and integrate companies that provide complementary products or technologies 

  

our growth strategy may involve pursuing strategic alliances with and making acquisitions of or investments in other companies that are complementary to our business there is substantial competition for attractive strategic alliance acquisition and investment candidates we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition investment or strategic partnership candidates even if we were able to identify them we cannot assure you that we will be able to partner with acquire or invest in suitable candidates or integrate acquired technologies or operations successfully into our existing technologies and operations our ability to finance potential acquisitions will be limited by our high degree of leverage the covenants contained in the indenture that governs our outstanding 8 senior notes the credit agreement that governs our senior secured credit facilities and any agreements governing any other debt we may incur 

  

if we are successful in acquiring other companies these acquisitions may have an adverse effect on our operating results particularly while the operations of the acquired business are being integrated it is also likely that integration of acquired companies would lead to the loss of key employees from those companies or the loss of customers of those companies in addition the integration of any acquired companies would require substantial attention from our senior management which may limit the amount of time available to be devoted to our daytoday operations or to the execution of our strategy furthermore the expansion of our business involves the risk that we might not manage our growth effectively that we would incur additional debt to finance these acquisitions or investments and that we would incur substantial charges relating to the writeoff of inprocess research and development similar to that which we incurred in connection with several of our prior acquisitions each of these items could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 

  

potential loss of licensed technology—the closing of the november 2000 transactions may have triggered change of control or antiassignment provisions in some of our license agreements which could result in a loss of our right to use licensed technology 

  

we have a number of crosslicenses with third parties that enable us to manufacture our products free from any infringement claims that might otherwise be made by these third parties against us a number of these licenses contain change of control or antiassignment provisions we have taken steps to transfer these licenses in connection with the closing of the november 2000 transactions however we cannot assure you that these transfers will not be challenged for example papst licensing gmbh ibm and hitachi initially took the position that their license agreements did not transfer to our new business entities subsequently we entered into new license agreements with ibm and hitachi in december 2001 in september 2002 we settled a broader dispute with papst that also resolved the claim by papst that its license agreement was not properly transferred 

  

we received a letter dated november 20 2002 from readrite corporation asserting that we do not currently have a license to its patented technology and that our rigid disc drive products infringe at least two of its patents we have since received additional letters from readrite corporation making the same claims seagate delaware entered into a patent cross license agreement dated december 31 1994 which covered the two patents referenced in the november 20 letter as well as other intellectual property of readrite corporation prior to the november 20 2002 letter readrite corporation had not responded to our efforts to confirm that under the patent cross license agreement we were entitled to a new license agreement in our own name and on materially the same terms as the 1994 agreement 

  

in order to clarify the parties’ rights under the patent cross license agreement we filed a declaratory judgment action on may 7 2003 in the superior court of california county of santa clara seeking a declaration that we are entitled to a crosslicense effective as of november 22 2000 under terms substantially identical to those contained in the patent cross license agreement on june 11 2003 readrite corporation answered the complaint putting forward a general denial and asserting various affirmative defenses on june 17 2003 readrite corporation filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under chapter 7 of the us bankruptcy code upon notice our declaratory judgment action has been stayed on july 23 2003 the us bankruptcy court approved the bid of western digital corporation to acquire the assets of readrite corporation including the intellectual property that was the subject of readrite’s assertions against us in a transaction which closed on july 31 2003 

  

to the extent that third party crosslicenses including the patent cross license agreement dated december 31 1994 between readrite corporation and seagate delaware are deemed not to have been properly assigned to us in the november 2000 transactions our inability to either obtain new licenses or transfer existing licenses could result in delays in product development or prevent us from selling our products until equivalent substitute technology can be identified licensed andor integrated or until we are able to substantially engineer our products to avoid infringing the rights of third parties we might not be able to renegotiate agreements be able to obtain necessary licenses in a timely manner on acceptable terms or at all or be able to reengineer our products successfully moreover the loss of or inability to extend any of these licenses would increase the risk of infringement claims being made against us which claims could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

risk of intellectual property litigation—our products may infringe the intellectual property rights of others which may cause us to incur unexpected costs or prevent us from selling our products 

  

we cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of others historically patent applications in the united states and some foreign countries have not been publicly disclosed until the patent is issued and we may not be aware of currently filed patent applications that relate to our products or technology if patents are later issued on these applications we may be liable for infringement we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims including claims of alleged infringement of the patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties by us or our licensees in connection with their use of our products we are currently subject to a suit by convolve inc and the massachusetts institute of technology and a suit pending in nanjing china in addition as noted above readrite corporation in a letter dated november 20 2002 and in correspondence since that date asserted that we do not currently have a license to readrite corporation patented technology and that our rigid disc drive products infringe at least two readrite corporation patents we filed a declaratory judgment action in the superior court of california seeking to clarify our rights to readrite corporation’s patented technology readrite corporation responded by filing a general denial and asserting various affirmative defenses on june 17 2003 readrite corporation filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under chapter 7 of the us bankruptcy code and pursuant to a notice we received on june 19 2003 our declaratory judgment action has been stayed on july 23 2003 the us bankruptcy court approved the bid of western digital corporation to acquire the assets of readrite corporation including the intellectual property that was the subject of readrite’s assertions against us in a transaction which closed on july 31 2003 

  

intellectual property litigation is expensive and timeconsuming regardless of the merits of any claim and could divert our management’s attention from operating our business in addition intellectual property lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties due to the complexity of the technical issues involved and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in defending ourselves against intellectual property claims moreover software patent litigation has increased due to the current uncertainty of the law and the increasing competition and overlap of product functionality in the field if we were to discover that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of others we would need to obtain licenses from these parties or substantially reengineer our products in order to avoid infringement we might not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms or at all or be able to reengineer our products successfully moreover if we are sued for infringement and lose the suit we could be required to pay substantial damages andor be enjoined from using or selling the infringing products or technology any of the foregoing could cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling our products 

  

dependence on intellectual property—if our intellectual property and other proprietary information were copied or independently developed by competitors our operating results would be negatively affected 

  

our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to protect and preserve the proprietary aspects of our technology however we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our technology without our authorization particularly in those countries where the laws do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states or protect us from independently developing or acquiring technology that is similar to ours for example in its bankruptcy proceedings under chapter 7 of the us bankruptcy code readrite corporation’s patents and other intellectual property rights were sold to western digital corporation who will use this intellectual property to compete against us the use of our technology or similar technology by others could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business if it became necessary for us to resort to litigation to protect these rights any proceedings could be burdensome and costly and we may not prevail 

  

limitations on patent protection—our issued and pending patents may not adequately protect our intellectual property or provide us with any competitive advantage 

  

although we have numerous us and foreign patents and numerous pending patents that relate to our technology we cannot assure you that any patents issued or pending will provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged by third parties moreover our competitors may already have applied for patents that once issued will prevail over our patent rights or otherwise limit our ability to sell our products in the united states or abroad our competitors also may attempt to design around our patents or copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology with respect to our pending patent applications we may not be successful in securing patents for these claims our failure to secure these patents may limit our ability to protect the intellectual property rights that these applications were intended to cover 

  

disclosure of our proprietary technology—confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements may not adequately protect our proprietary technology or trade secrets 

  

we have entered into confidentiality agreements with our employees and nondisclosure agreements with customers suppliers and potential strategic partners among others if any party to these agreements were to violate their agreement with us and disclose our proprietary technology to a third party we may be unable to prevent the third party from using this information because a significant portion of our proprietary technology consists of specialized knowledge and technical expertise developed by our employees we have a program in place designed to ensure that our employees communicate any developments or discoveries they make to other employees however employees may choose to leave our company before transferring their knowledge and expertise to our other employees violations by others of our confidentiality or nondisclosure agreements and the loss of employees who have specialized knowledge and expertise could harm our competitive position and cause our sales and operating results to decline our trade secrets may otherwise become known or independently developed by others and trade secret laws provide no remedy against independent development or discovery 

  

service marks and trademarks—our failure to obtain trademark registrations or service marks or challenges to those marks could impede our marketing efforts 

  

we have registered and applied for some service marks and trademarks and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional service marks and trademarks as appropriate we cannot guarantee the approval of any of our pending applications by the applicable governmental authorities moreover even if the applications are approved third parties may seek to oppose or otherwise challenge these registrations a failure to obtain trademark registrations in the united states and in other countries could limit our ability to use our trademarks and impede our marketing efforts in those jurisdictions 

  

environmental matters—we could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs fines and civil or criminal sanctions as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws 

  

our operations inside and outside the united states are subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites in addition to the us federal state and local laws to which our domestic operations are subject our extensive international manufacturing operations subject us to environmental regulations imposed by foreign governments 

  

although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection at our sites inside and outside the united states we could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs fines and civil or criminal sanctions thirdparty property damage or personal injury claims if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or become noncompliant with environmental permits required at our facilities contaminants have been detected at some of our present and former sites principally in connection with historical operations in addition we have been named as a potentially responsible party at several superfund sites while we are not currently aware of any contaminated or superfund sites as to which material outstanding claims or obligations exist the discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of additional cleanup obligations at these or other sites could result in significant liability in addition the ultimate costs under environmental laws and the timing of these costs are difficult to predict liability under some environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can be imposed retroactively and on a joint and several basis in other words one liable party could be held liable for all costs at a site potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with environmental laws that may be adopted or imposed in the future 

  

dependence on key personnel—the loss of some key executive officers and employees could negatively impact our business prospects 

  

our future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued service of key members of management as well as marketing sales and product development personnel the loss of one or more of our key personnel would have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition we believe our future success will also depend in large part upon our ability to attract retain and further incentivize highly skilled management marketing sales and product development personnel a significant portion of the incentive compensation for our senior management vests in calendar year 2003 and substantially all of this compensation will have vested by november 2004 we may not be able to provide our senior management with adequate additional incentives to remain employed by us after this time we have experienced intense competition for personnel and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our key employees or that we will be successful in attracting assimilating and retaining personnel in the future 

  

system failures—system failures caused by events beyond our control could adversely affect computer equipment and electronic data on which our operations depend 

  

our operations are dependent on our ability to protect our computer equipment and the information stored in our databases from damage by among other things earthquake fire natural disaster power loss telecommunications failures unauthorized intrusion and other catastrophic events as our operations become more automated and increasingly interdependent our exposure to the risks posed by these types of events will increase a significant part of our operations is based in an area of california that has experienced power outages and earthquakes and is considered seismically active we do not have a contingency plan for addressing the kinds of events referred to in this paragraph that would be sufficient to prevent system failures and other interruptions in our operations that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

potential tax legislation—negative publicity about companies located in certain offshore jurisdictions may lead to new legislation that could increase our tax burden 

  

several members of the united states congress have introduced legislation relating to the us federal tax treatment of us companies that have undertaken certain types of expatriation transactions while we do not believe that this legislation as currently proposed would adversely affect us the exact scope of the legislation and whether it will ultimately be enacted is unclear at this time in addition certain state legislatures have proposed similar legislation therefore it is possible that federal or state legislation in this area if enacted could materially increase our future tax burden or otherwise affect our business 

  

risks related to our substantial indebtedness 

  

substantial leverage—our substantial leverage may place us at a competitive disadvantage in our industry 

  

we are leveraged and have significant debt service obligations our significant debt and debt service requirements could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities for example our high level of debt presents the following risks to you 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

significant debt service requirements—servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate cash may be affected by factors beyond our control 

  

our business may not generate cash flow in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay the principal of or interest on our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs including working capital capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control we cannot assure you that 

  

   

   

   

if we cannot fund our liquidity needs we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures product development efforts strategic acquisitions investments and alliances selling assets restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital we cannot assure you that any of these remedies could if necessary be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all in addition our existing debt instruments permit us to incur a significant amount of additional debt if we incur additional debt above the levels now in effect the risks associated with our substantial leverage including the risk that we will be unable to service our debt or generate enough cash flow to fund our liquidity needs could intensify 

  

restrictions imposed by debt covenants—restrictions imposed by our existing debt instruments will limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in our interest 

  

our existing debt instruments including the indenture governing our outstanding 8 senior notes impose and the terms of any future debt may impose operating and other restrictions on us the indenture governing our 8 notes limits our ability to incur additional indebtedness if our consolidated coverage ratio which is the ratio of the aggregate consolidated ebitda of our subsidiary seagate technology hdd holdings the issuer of our 8 senior notes and its restricted subsidiaries to the total interest expense of those entities is less than or equal to 30 to 10 during any consecutive fourquarter period our existing debt instruments also limit among other things our ability to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

these covenants are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions including exceptions that permit us to make significant distributions of cash in addition the obligation to comply with many of the covenants under the indenture governing our 8 senior notes will cease to apply if the notes achieve investment grade status 

  

our existing debt instruments also require us to achieve specified financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control 

  

a breach of any of the restrictive covenants described above or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our existing debt instruments if a default occurs the holders of our outstanding 8 senior notes may elect to declare all of our outstanding obligations together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable if our outstanding indebtedness were to be accelerated we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full that debt and any future indebtedness which would cause the market price of our common shares to decline significantly 

  

risks related to our common shares 

  

control by our sponsor group—because our sponsor group through its ownership of new sac will continue to hold a controlling interest in us the influence of our public shareholders over significant corporate actions will be limited 

  

after the secondary public offering of our common shares by new sac in july 2003 affiliates of silver lake partners texas pacific group august capital jp morgan partners llc and investment partnerships affiliated with goldman sachs  co indirectly own approximately 200 142 73 42 and 14 respectively of our outstanding common shares through their ownership of new sac the sponsors’ ownership of new sac and new sac’s and the sponsors’ ownership of us is the subject of shareholders agreements and other arrangements that result in the sponsors’ acting as a group with respect to all matters submitted to our shareholders as a result the members of our sponsor group will continue to have the power to 

  

   

   

   

also new sac is not prohibited from selling a controlling interest in us to a third party 

  

accordingly our ability to engage in significant transactions such as a merger acquisition or liquidation is limited without the consent of members of our sponsor group conflicts of interest could arise between us and our sponsor group and any conflict of interest may be resolved in a manner that does not favor us the members of our sponsor group may continue to retain control of us for the foreseeable future and may decide not to enter into a transaction in which you would receive consideration for your common shares that is much higher than the cost to you or the thencurrent market price of those shares in addition the members of our sponsor group could elect to sell a controlling interest in us and you may receive less than the thencurrent fair market value or the price you paid for your shares any decision regarding their ownership of us that members of our sponsor group may make at some future time will be in their absolute discretion 

  

future sales—additional sales of our common shares by new sac our sponsors or our employees or issuances by us in connection with future acquisitions or otherwise could cause the price of our common shares to decline 

  

if new sac or – after any distribution to our sponsors of our shares by new sac – our sponsors sell a substantial number of our common shares in the future the market price of our common shares could decline the perception among investors that these sales may occur could produce the same effect new sac and our sponsors have rights subject to specified conditions to require us to file registration statements covering common shares or to include common shares in registration statements that we may file by exercising their registration rights and selling a large number of common shares new sac or any of the sponsors could cause the price of our common shares to decline furthermore if we were to include common shares in a registration statement initiated by us those additional shares could impair our ability to raise needed capital by depressing the price at which we could sell our common shares 

  

one component of our business strategy is to make acquisitions in the event of any future acquisitions we could issue additional common shares which would have the effect of diluting your percentage ownership of the common shares and could cause the price of our common shares to decline 

  

volatile public markets—the price of our common shares may be volatile and could decline significantly 

  

the stock market in general and the market for technology stocks in particular has recently experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of companies if these market or industrybased fluctuations continue the trading price of our common shares could decline significantly independent of our actual operating performance and you could lose all or a substantial part of your investment the market price of our common shares could fluctuate significantly in response to several factors including among others 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

failure to pay quarterly distributions—our failure to pay quarterly distributions to our common shareholders could cause the market price of our common shares to decline significantly 

  

in accordance with our quarterly dividend policy in effect at such time our board of directors declared and paid quarterly distributions of 003 per share or approximately 13 million to all of our shareholders of record as of each of february 14 2003 and may 9 2003 including new sac on june 27 2003 our board of directors amended our dividend policy and pursuant to our amended policy we expect to pay our shareholders a quarterly distribution of up to 004 per share 016 annually so long as the aggregate amount of the distributions do not exceed 50 of our consolidated net income for the quarter in which the distributions are declared on july 14 2003 our board of directors declared a quarterly distribution of 004 per share to be paid on or before august 22 2003 to our shareholders of record as of august 8 2003 

  

our ability to pay quarterly distributions will be subject to among other things general business conditions within the rigid disc drive industry our financial results the impact of paying distributions on our credit ratings and legal and contractual restrictions on the payment of distributions by our subsidiaries to us or by us to our shareholders including restrictions imposed by the covenants contained in the indenture governing our senior notes and the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities any reduction or discontinuation of quarterly distributions could cause the market price of our common shares to decline significantly moreover in the event our payment of quarterly distributions is reduced or discontinued our failure or inability to resume paying distributions at historical levels could result in a persistently low market valuation of our common shares 

  

taxation of distributions—certain us shareholders may be ineligible for favorable us federal income tax treatment on distributions on our common shares 

  

because we did not have any current or accumulated earnings and profits for us federal income tax purposes for our taxable year ended june 27 2003 distributions on our common shares during this period were treated as a return of capital rather than dividend income for us federal income tax purposes there can be no assurance however that we will not have current or accumulated earnings and profits for us federal income tax purposes in future years to the extent that we have current or accumulated earnings and profits for us federal income tax purposes distributions on our common shares will not be treated as a return of capital distribution and will be treated as dividend income 

  

furthermore we currently believe that we are a foreign personal holding company for us federal income tax purposes under recent us federal income tax legislation us shareholders who are individuals will not be eligible for reduced rates of taxation applicable to certain dividend income currently a maximum rate of 15 on distributions on our common shares if we qualify as a foreign personal holding company in the year in which such distributions were made or in the preceding taxable year as a result if distributions on our common shares are treated as dividend income because we have current or accumulated earnings and profits in the taxable year in which such distributions are made us shareholders who are individuals may not qualify for favorable us federal income tax treatment under the new legislation 

  

potential governmental action—governmental action against companies located in offshore jurisdictions may lead to a reduction in the demand for our common shares 

  

recently several state and other governmental officials have threatened to take legislative and other actions against us companies that have expatriated to specific foreign jurisdictions for example the california state treasurer has requested that certain pension funds eliminate from their investment portfolios all public equity and fixed income holdings of companies that have reincorporated in foreign jurisdictions if we are included within the scope of such legislation or governmental action it may reduce the demand for and have a material adverse effect on the price of our common shares 

  

securities litigation—significant fluctuations in the market price of our common shares could result in securities class action claims against us 

  

significant price and value fluctuations have occurred with respect to the publicly traded securities of rigid disc drive companies and technology companies generally the price of our common shares is likely to be volatile in the future in the past following periods of decline in the market price of a company’s securities class action lawsuits have often been pursued against that company if similar litigation were pursued against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

limited protection of shareholder interests—holders of the common shares may face difficulties in protecting their interests because we are incorporated under cayman islands law 

  

our corporate affairs are governed by our second amended and restated memorandum and articles of association by the companies law 2003 revision and the common law of the cayman islands the rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under cayman islands law are not as clearly established as under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in jurisdictions in the united states therefore you may have more difficulty in protecting your interests in the face of actions by our management directors or controlling shareholder than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction in the united states due to the comparatively less developed nature of cayman islands law in this area 

  

unlike many jurisdictions in the united states cayman islands law does not specifically provide for shareholder appraisal rights on a merger or consolidation of a company this may make it more difficult for you to assess the value of any consideration you may receive in a merger or consolidation or to require that the offeror give you additional consideration if you believe the consideration offered is insufficient 

  

shareholders of cayman islands exempted companies such as ourselves have no general rights under cayman islands law to inspect corporate records and accounts or to obtain copies of lists of shareholders of the company our directors have discretion under our articles of association to determine whether or not and under what conditions our corporate records may be inspected by our shareholders but are not obliged to make them available to our shareholders this may make it more difficult for you to obtain the information needed to establish any facts necessary for a shareholder motion or to solicit proxies from other shareholders in connection with a proxy contest 

  

subject to limited exceptions under cayman islands law a minority shareholder may not bring a derivative action against the board of directors our cayman islands counsel is not aware of any reported class action or derivative action having been brought in a cayman islands court 

  

antitakeover provisions could discourage or prevent an acquisition of us—provisions of our articles of association and cayman islands corporate law may impede a takeover which could adversely affect the value of the common shares 

  

our articles of association permit our board of directors to issue preferred shares from time to time with such rights and preferences as they consider appropriate our board of directors could authorize the issuance of preferred shares with terms and conditions and under circumstances that could have an effect of discouraging a takeover or other transaction 

  

unlike many jurisdictions in the united states cayman islands law does not provide for mergers as that expression is understood under corporate law in the united states while cayman islands law does have statutory provisions that provide for the reconstruction and amalgamation of companies which are commonly referred to in the cayman islands as a “scheme of arrangement” the procedural and legal requirements necessary to consummate these transactions are more rigorous and take longer to complete than the procedures typically required to consummate a merger in the united states under cayman islands law and practice a scheme of arrangement in relation to a solvent cayman islands exempted company must be approved at a shareholders’ meeting by a majority of the company’s shareholders who are present and voting either in person or by proxy at such meeting the shares voted in favor of the scheme of arrangement must also represent at least 75 of the value of each class of the company’s shareholders excluding the shares owned by the parties to the scheme of arrangement present and voting at the meeting the convening of these meetings and the terms of the amalgamation must also be sanctioned by the grand court of the cayman islands although there is no requirement to seek the consent of the creditors of the parties involved in the scheme of arrangement the grand court typically seeks to ensure that the creditors have consented to the transfer of their liabilities to the surviving entity or that the scheme of arrangement does not otherwise materially adversely affect the creditors’ interests furthermore the grand court will only approve a scheme of arrangement if it is satisfied that 

  

   

   

   

   

enforcement of civil liabilities—holders of our common shares may have difficulty obtaining or enforcing a judgment against us because we are incorporated under the laws of the cayman islands 

  

because we are a cayman islands exempted company there is uncertainty as to whether the grand court of the cayman islands would recognize or enforce judgments of united states courts obtained against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof or be competent to hear original actions brought in the cayman islands against us predicated upon the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof 

  

item 7a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 

  

interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and longterm debt we currently do not use derivative financial instruments in either our investment portfolio or to hedge debt 

  

we invest in high credit quality issuers and by policy limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer as stated in our policy we are averse to principal loss and ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk market risk and reinvestment risk 

  

we mitigate default risk by maintaining a diversified portfolio and by investing in only high quality securities we constantly monitor our investment portfolio and position our portfolio to respond appropriately to a reduction in credit rating of any investment issuer guarantor or depository we maintain a highly liquid portfolio by investing only in marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets 

  

we have both fixed and floating rate debt obligations we enter into debt obligations to support general corporate purposes including capital expenditures and working capital needs we have used derivative financial instruments in the form of an interest rate swap agreement to hedge a portion of our floating rate debt obligations for example in december 2000 we entered into a fixed rate interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of 245 million and an interest rate of 540 for a term of two years the maturity date of the swap matched the principal serial maturities on the underlying debt credit exposure resulting from the derivative financial instruments was diversified among various commercial banking institutions in the united states and europe the interest rate swap agreement matured in november 2002 

  

the table below presents principal or notional amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio and debt obligations as of june 27 2003 all investments mature in three years or less 

  

   

foreign currency risk we transact business in various foreign countries our primary foreign currency cash flows are in emerging market countries in asia and in european countries during fiscal year 2003 we did not hedge any of our local currency cash flows all foreign currency cash flow requirements were met using spot foreign exchange transactions
