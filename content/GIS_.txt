in which  

we participate

our principal  

competitors in  

these categories 

are manufacturers as  

well as retailers with  

their own branded  

products competitors market  

and sell their products  

through brickand

product categories we  

compete not only  

with other widely  

advertised branded  

products 

but also  

with regional  

brands and  

with generic  

and private  

label products  

that are  

generally sold  

at lower  

prices internationally  

we 

compete with both multinational and local manufacturers and each  

country includes a unique group of competitors 

raw materials ingredients and packaging 

the  

principal  

raw  

materials that  

we  

use  

are grains  

wheat oats  

and  

corn  

dairy  

products  

sugar  

fruits vegetable  

oils meats  

nuts 

vegetables  

and  

other  

agricultural  

products  

we  

also

substantial  

quantities

and  

metal

materials  

operating  

supplies  

and  

energy  

most  

of  

these  

inputs  

for  

our  

domestic  

and  

canadian  

operations  

are  

purchased 

from suppliers  

in the  

united states in  

our other  

international operations  

inputs that  

are not locally  

available in  

adequate supply  

may 

be imported  

from other  

countries the  

cost of  

these inputs  

may fluctuate  

widely due  

to external  

conditions such  

as weather  

climate

pandemics 

including the

war and  

changes in  

governmental agricultural  

and energy  

policies and  

regulations we  

believe 

that we  

will be  

able to  

obtain an  

adequate supply  

of needed  

inputs occasionally  

and where  

possible we  

make advance  

purchases of 

items  

significant  

to our  

business in  

order  

to ensure  

continuity  

of operations  

our objective  

is to  

procure  

materials  

meeting  

both our 

quality standards  

and our  

production  

needs at  

price levels  

that allow  

a targeted  

profit margin  

since these  

inputs generally  

represent 

the largest  

variable cost in  

manufacturing our products  

to the extent  

possible we often  

manage the risk  

associated with adverse  

price 

movements for some inputs using a variety of risk  

management strategies we also  

have a grain merchandising operation that provides 

us efficient access  

to and more informed  

knowledge of various  

commodity markets principally  

wheat and oats this  

operation holds 

physical inventories  

that are  

carried at net  

realizable value  

and uses  

derivatives to  

manage its net

if we  

fail  

to anticipate  

identify  

or 

react to these changes and trends such as adapting to emerging  

ecommerce channels or to introduce new and improved products on  

a 

timely basis we may  

experience reduced demand  

for our products which  

would in turn cause  

our revenues and profitability  

to suffer 

similarly demand

or

we may be unable to grow  

our market share or add products that are  

in faster

growing and more profitable categories

 

the  

food  

industry’s  

growth  

potential  

is  

constrained  

by

growth  

our  

success  

depends  

in

on  

our  

ability  

to  

grow  

our 

business faster than  

populations are growing  

in the markets  

that we serve  

one way to  

achieve that growth  

is to enhance  

our portfolio 

by adding innovative  

new products in faster  

growing and more  

profitable categories our future  

results will also depend  

on our ability 

to  

increase

we  

do  

not  

succeed

our results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain  

their favorable perception of our brands

 

maintaining and continually  

enhancing the value  

of our many  

iconic brands is critical  

to the success of

additional resources to restore our supply chain 

 

short term or  

sustained increases in  

consumer demand at  

our retail customers  

may exceed our  

production capacity or  

otherwise strain 

our supply chain our failure to meet the demand for our products could  

adversely affect our business and results of operations 

 

our international operations are subject to political and economic  

risks

 

in fiscal  

2022 23  

percent of  

our consolidated  

net sales  

were generated  

outside of  

the united  

states we  

are accordingly  

subject to  

a 

number of risks relating to doing business internationally  

any of which could significantly harm our business these risks include 

 

●

political and economic instability 

●

exchange controls and currency exchange rates 

●

tariffs on products and ingredients that we import and export 

●

nationalization or government control of operations 

●

compliance with anticorruption regulations 

●

foreign tax treaties and policies and 

●

restriction on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries including  

potentially negative tax consequences 

 

our financial performance  

on a us dollar  

denominated basis is subject  

to fluctuations in currency  

exchange rates these fluctuations 

could cause material  

variations in our results  

of operations our principal  

exposures are to the  

australian dollar

are  

intended  

to  

reduce  

the  

effects  

of  

our  

exposure  

to  

currency  

fluctuations  

but  

these  

agreements  

may  

not  

be 

effective in significantly reducing our exposure 

 

a

in  

the  

us  

dollar  

relative  

to  

other

we  

operate  

would  

negatively  

affect  

our 

reported results of operations and financial results due to currency translation losses and  

currency transaction losses

costs including  

grains oats  

wheat and

dairy products natural gas and diesel  

fuel changes in the values  

of these derivatives are recorded

operating profit we  

also 

record our grain inventories at net realizable value we  

may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments 

economic downturns could limit consumer demand for our products

 

the  

willingness  

of  

consumers  

to  

purchase  

our

depends  

in  

part  

on  

local  

economic

more  

generic

may  

forego  

certain

altogether  

in those circumstances  

we could experience  

a reduction in sales  

of higher margin  

products or a shift  

in our product mix  

to 

lower margin  

offerings  

in addition  

as a  

result of  

economic conditions

consumers may  

also reduce the

our ability

executive overview 

we  

are  

a  

global packaged  

foods company  

we  

develop  

distinctive  

valueadded  

food  

products  

and  

market  

them under  

unique  

brand 

names  

we  

work  

continuously  

to  

improve  

our  

core  

products  

and  

to  

create  

new  

products  

that  

meet  

consumers’  

evolving  

needs  

and 

preferences  

in  

addition  

we  

build  

the  

equity  

of  

our  

brands  

over  

time  

with  

strong  

consumerdirected  

marketing  

innovative  

new 

products  

and  

effective  

merchandising  

we  

believe  

our  

brandbuilding  

approach  

is  

the  

key  

to  

winning  

and  

sustaining  

leading  

share 

positions in markets around the globe 

our fundamental  

financial goal is  

to generate competitively  

differentiated returns  

for our shareholders  

over the long  

term we  

believe 

achieving  

that  

goal  

requires  

us  

to  

generate  

a  

consistent  

balance  

of  

net  

sales  

growth  

margin  

expansion  

cash  

conversion  

and  

cash 

return to shareholders over time 

our longterm growth objectives are to deliver the following performance  

on average over time 

●

2 to 3 percent annual growth in organic net sales 

●

midsingledigit annual growth in adjusted operating profit 

●

mid to highsingledigit annual growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share  

eps 

●

free cash flow conversion of at least 95 percent of adjusted net earnings after  

tax and 

●

cash return to shareholders of 80 to 90 percent of free cash flow  

including an attractive dividend yield 

we  

are executing  

our accelerate  

strategy to  

drive sustainable  

profitable gro  

wth and  

toptier shareholder  

returns over  

the long  

term  

the  

strategy  

focuses  

on  

four

the  

best

growth  

and  

we  

are  

committed  

to  

reshaping  

our  

portfolio  

with  

strategic  

acquisitions  

and 

divestitures to further enhance our growth profile 

we  

expect that  

changes in  

consumer behaviors  

driven by  

the covid19  

pandemic will  

result in  

ongoing elevated  

consumer demand 

for food at home relative to prepandemic levels these  

changes include more time spent working  

from home and increased consumer 

appreciation  

for cooking  

and baking  

we  

plan to  

capitalize on  

these opportunities  

addressing evolving  

consumer  

needs through  

our 

leading brands innovation and advantaged capabilities to generate profitable  

growth 

in fiscal 2022  

we successfully adapted  

to the volatile operating  

environment responding quickly  

to significant increases in  

input cost 

inflation and supply chain disruptions and keeping  

our brands available for our customers and consumers  

as a result we were able to 

grow organic  

net sales adjusted  

operating profit  

and adjusted diluted  

eps ahead of  

our initial targets  

we  

achieved each  

of the  

three 

priorities we established at the beginning of the year  

we  

continued  

to  

compete  

effectively  

including  

holding  

or

in  

70  

percent  

of  

our  

global  

priority

we  

generated organic

growth across  

each of  

our four  

operating segments  

fueled by  

compelling brand 

building  

and  

innovation  

across our  

leading  

brands  

and  

supported  

with  

strong  

levels  

of  

net price

in  

response  

to 

significant input cost inflation 

we  

successfully navigated  

the dynamic supply

we are planning  

for volume elasticities to increase but remain below  

historical levels and supply chain disruptions to

driven by changes  

in income taxes

critical accounting estimates

considerations related to the covid19 pandemic  

the continuing  

impact that  

the recent  

covid19 pandemic  

will have  

on our  

consolidated results  

of operations  

is uncertain  

we  

saw 

increased  

orders from  

retail customers  

across all  

geographies in  

response to  

increased consumer  

demand for  

food at  

home we  

also 

experienced  

a  

covid19related  

decrease  

in  

consumer  

traffic  

in  

awayfromhome  

food  

outlets  

in  

fiscal  

2023  

we  

expect  

athome 

food demand  

will decline year  

over year across  

most of our  

core markets  

though will remain  

above prepandemic  

levels conversely 

we expect awayfrom home food demand  

to continue to recover  

though not fully to prepandemic levels  

we expect one of  

the largest 

factors  

impacting  

our  

performance  

will  

be  

relative  

balance  

of  

athome  

versus  

awayfromhome  

consumer  

food  

demand  

primarily 

driven by  

the level  

of virus  

control in  

markets around  

the world  

which remains  

uncertain we  

have considered  

the potential  

impacts 

of the  

covid19 pandemic  

in our

our expected

is determined  

by our asset

our

by asset class using input from our

percent for fiscal 2022 572  

percent for

for fiscal 2023 we increased our weightedaverage  

expected rate of return on plan assets 

for our principal  

defined benefit pension  

and other postretirement  

plans in the  

united states to  

675 percent due  

to higher prospective

our review  

is based  

on data  

we collect  

about our

claims experience 

and information  

provided by our  

actuaries this information  

includes recent  

plan experience  

plan design overall  

industry experience 

and projections and  

assumptions used by other  

similar organizations  

our initial health  

care cost trend  

rate is adjusted  

as necessary to 

remain consistent  

with this  

review  

recent experiences  

and shortterm  

expectations our  

initial health  

care cost  

trend rate  

assumption 

is 60  

percent for  

retirees age  

65 and  

over and  

59 percent  

for retirees  

under age  

65 at  

the end  

of fiscal  

2022 rates  

are graded  

down 

annually until  

the ultimate  

trend rate  

of 45  

percent is  

reached in  

2031 for  

all retirees  

the trend  

rates are  

applicable for  

calculations 

only if  

the retirees’  

benefits increase  

as a  

result of  

health care  

inflation the  

ultimate trend  

rate is  

adjusted annually  

as necessary  

to 

approximate  

the  

current  

economic  

view  

on  

the  

rate  

of  

longterm  

inflation  

plus  

an  

appropriate

as of  

may 29  

2022 we  

had 

cumulative unrecognized

and cumulative unrecognized  

actuarial 

net  

gains  

of  

207 million  

on  

our  

postretirement

postemployment  

benefit  

plans  

mainly  

as  

the  

result  

of  

liability  

increases  

from

partially  

offset  

by

in  

the

these

result in  

increases  

in our

 item 1a  risk factors 

  

our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties any of the risks described below could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

business and industry risks 

  

global health developments and economic uncertainty resulting from the covid19 pandemic could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

the public health crisis caused by the covid19 pandemic and the measures being taken by governments businesses including us and the public at large to limit covid19’s spread have had and we expect will continue to have certain negative impacts on our business financial condition and results of operations including without limitation the following 

  

 we have experienced and may continue to experience a decrease in sales of certain of our products in markets around the world that have been affected by the covid19 pandemic in particular sales of our products in the awayfromhome food outlets across all our major markets have been negatively affected by reduced consumer traffic resulting from shelterinplace regulations or recommendations and closings of restaurants schools and cafeterias if the covid19 pandemic persists or intensifies its negative impacts on our sales particularly in awayfromhome food outlets could be more prolonged and may become more severe 

 deteriorating economic and political conditions in our major markets affected by the covid19 pandemic such as increased unemployment decreases in disposable income declines in consumer confidence or economic slowdowns or recessions could cause a decrease in demand for our products 

 we have experienced minor temporary workforce disruptions in our supply chain as a result of the covid19 pandemic we have implemented employee safety measures based on guidance from the centers for disease control and prevention and world health organization across all our supply chain facilities including proper hygiene social distancing mask use and temperature screenings these measures may not be sufficient to prevent the spread of covid19 among our employees illness travel restrictions absenteeism or other workforce disruptions could negatively affect our supply chain manufacturing distribution or other business processes we may face additional production disruptions in the future which may place constraints on our ability to produce products in a timely manner or may increase our costs 

 changes and volatility in consumer purchasing and consumption patterns may increase demand for our products in one quarter resulting in decreased consumer demand for our products in subsequent quarters short term or sustained increases in consumer demand at our retail customers may exceed our production capacity or otherwise strain our supply chain 

 the failure of third parties on which we rely including those third parties who supply our ingredients packaging capital equipment and other necessary operating materials contract manufacturers commercial transport distributors contractors commercial banks and external business partners to meet their obligations to us or significant disruptions in their ability to do so may negatively impact our operations 

 significant changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture sell or distribute our products including quarantines importexport restrictions price controls governmental or regulatory actions closures or other restrictions that limit or close our operating and manufacturing facilities restrict our employees’ ability to travel or perform necessary business functions or otherwise prevent our thirdparty partners suppliers or customers from sufficiently staffing operations including operations necessary for the production distribution and sale of our products could adversely impact our operations and results 

 actions we have taken or may take or decisions we have made or may make as a consequence of the covid19 pandemic may result in investigations legal claims or litigation against us 

  

the categories in which we participate are very competitive and if we are   not able to compete effectively our results of operations could be adversely   affected 

  

the consumer and pet food categories in which we participate are very competitive our principal competitors in these categories are manufacturers as well as retailers with their own branded and private label products competitors market and sell their products through brickandmortar stores and ecommerce all of our principal competitors have substantial financial marketing and other resources in most product categories we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products but also with regional brands and with generic and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices competition in our product categories is based on product innovation product quality price brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing promotional activity convenient ordering and delivery to the consumer and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences if our large competitors were to seek an advantage through pricing or promotional changes we could choose to do the same which could adversely affect our margins and profitability if we did not do the same our revenues and market share could be adversely affected our market share and revenue growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing innovative products in response to changing consumer demands or by new product introductions of our competitors if we are unable to build and sustain 

  

brand equity by offering recognizably superior product quality we may be unable to maintain premium pricing over generic and private label products 

  

we may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face of a consolidating retail environment 

  

there has been significant consolidation in the grocery industry resulting in customers with increased purchasing power in addition large retail customers may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency lower pricing increased reliance on their own brand name products increased emphasis on generic and other economy brands and increased promotional programs if we are unable to use our scale marketing expertise product innovation knowledge of consumers’ needs and category leadership positions to respond to these demands our profitability and volume growth could be negatively impacted in addition the loss of any large customer could adversely affect our sales and profits in fiscal 2021 walmart accounted for 20 percent of our consolidated net sales and 29 percent of net sales of our north america retail segment for more information on significant customers please see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

  

price changes for the commodities we depend on for raw materials packaging   and energy may adversely affect our profitability 

  

the principal raw materials that we use are commodities that experience price volatility caused by external conditions such as weather climate change product scarcity limited sources of supply commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations trade tariffs pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations commodity prices have become and may continue to be more volatile during the covid19 pandemic commodity price changes may result in unexpected increases in raw material packaging energy and transportation costs if we are unable to increase productivity to offset these increased costs or increase our prices we may experience reduced margins and profitability we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and the risk management procedures that we do use may not always work as we intend 

  

concerns with the safety and quality of our products could cause consumers to   avoid certain products or ingredients 

  

we could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain of our products or ingredients adverse publicity about these types of concerns whether or not valid may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions 

  

we may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and trends   which may result in decreased demand for our products 

  

our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes eating habits and purchasing behaviors of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences in channels where they shop consumer preferences and categorylevel consumption may change from time to time and can be affected by a number of different trends and other factors if we fail to anticipate identify or react to these changes and trends such as adapting to emerging ecommerce channels or to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis we may experience reduced demand for our products which would in turn cause our revenues and profitability to suffer similarly demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns regarding the health effects of ingredients such as sodium trans fats genetically modified organisms sugar processed wheat grainfree or legumerich pet food or other product ingredients or attributes 

  

we may be unable to grow our market share or add products that are in faster   growing and more profitable categories 

  

the food industry’s growth potential is constrained by population growth our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business faster than populations are growing in the markets that we serve one way to achieve that growth is to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new products in faster growing and more profitable categories our future results will also depend on our ability to increase market share in our existing product categories if we do not succeed in developing innovative products for new and existing categories our growth and profitability could be adversely affected 

  

our results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands 

  

maintaining and continually enhancing the value of our many iconic brands is critical to the success of our business the value of our brands is based in large part on the degree to which consumers react and respond positively to these brands brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner adverse publicity about our products our failure to maintain the quality of our products the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences concerns about food safety or our products becoming unavailable to consumers consumer demand for our products may also be impacted by changes in the level of advertising or promotional support the use of social and digital media by consumers us and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and 

  

opinions can be shared negative posts or comments about us our brands or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation if we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands our business results could be negatively impacted 

  

operating risks 

  

if we are not efficient in our production our profitability could suffer as a   result of the highly competitive environment in which we operate 

  

our future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to be efficient in the production and manufacture of our products in highly competitive markets gaining additional efficiencies may become more difficult over time our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or by eliminating redundant costs resulting from acquisitions or divestitures could adversely affect our profitability and weaken our competitive position many productivity initiatives involve complex reorganization of manufacturing facilities and production lines such manufacturing realignment may result in the interruption of production which may negatively impact product volume and margins we periodically engage in restructuring and cost savings initiatives designed to increase our efficiency and reduce expenses if we are unable to execute those initiatives as planned we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

disruption of our supply chain could adversely affect our business 

  

our ability to make move and sell products is critical to our success damage or disruption to raw material supplies or our manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather climate change natural disaster fire terrorism cyberattack pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic governmental restrictions or mandates strikes importexport restrictions or other factors could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products many of our product lines are manufactured at a single location or sourced from a single supplier the failure of third parties on which we rely including those third parties who supply our ingredients packaging capital equipment and other necessary operating materials contract manufacturers commercial transport distributors contractors and external business partners to meet their obligations to us or significant disruptions in their ability to do so may negatively impact our operations our suppliers’ policies and practices can damage our reputation and the quality and safety of our products disputes with significant suppliers including disputes regarding pricing or performance could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers and could materially and adversely affect our sales financial condition and results of operations failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or to effectively manage such events if they occur particularly when a product is sourced from a single location or supplier could adversely affect our business and results of operations as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain 

  

short term or sustained increases in consumer demand at our retail customers may exceed our production capacity or otherwise strain our supply chain our failure to meet the demand for our products could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

our international operations are subject to political and economic risks 

  

in fiscal 2021 26 percent of our consolidated net sales were generated outside of the united states we are accordingly subject to a number of risks relating to doing business internationally any of which could significantly harm our business these risks include 

  

 political and economic instability 

 exchange controls and currency exchange rates 

 tariffs on products and ingredients that we import and export 

 nationalization or government control of operations 

 compliance with anticorruption regulations 

 uncertainty relating to the impact of the united kingdom’s exit from the european union 

 foreign tax treaties and policies and 

 restriction on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries including potentially negative tax consequences 

  

our financial performance on a us dollar denominated basis is subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates these fluctuations could cause material variations in our results of operations our principal exposures are to the australian dollar brazilian real british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese renminbi euro japanese yen mexican peso and swiss franc from time to time we enter into agreements that are intended to reduce the effects of our exposure to currency fluctuations but these agreements may not be effective in significantly reducing our exposure 

  

a strengthening in the us dollar relative to other currencies in the countries in which we operate such as has generally occurred during the covid19 pandemic todate would negatively affect our reported results of operations and financial results due to currency translation losses and currency transaction losses 

  

  

our business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or are breached 

  

information technology serves an important role in the efficient and effective operation of our business we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information to manage a variety of business processes and to comply with regulatory legal and tax requirements our information technology systems and infrastructure are critical to effectively manage our key business processes including digital marketing order entry and fulfillment supply chain management finance administration and other business processes these technologies enable internal and external communication among our locations employees suppliers customers and others and include the receipt and storage of personal information about our employees consumers and proprietary business information our information technology systems some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties may be vulnerable to damage interruption or shutdown due to any number of causes such as catastrophic events natural disasters fires power outages systems failures telecommunications failures security breaches computer viruses hackers employee error or malfeasance and other causes increased cybersecurity threats pose a potential risk to the security and viability of our information technology systems as well as the confidentiality integrity and availability of the data stored on those systems the failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and result in transaction errors processing inefficiencies data loss legal claims or proceedings regulatory penalties and the loss of sales and customers any interruption of our information technology systems could have operational reputational legal and financial impacts that may have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

our failure to successfully integrate acquisitions into our existing operations could adversely affect our financial results 

  

from time to time we evaluate potential acquisitions or joint ventures that would further our strategic objectives our success depends in part upon our ability to integrate acquired and existing operations if we are unable to successfully integrate acquisitions our financial results could suffer additional potential risks associated with acquisitions include additional debt leverage the loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business the assumption of unknown liabilities the inherent risk associated with entering a geographic area or line of business in which we have no or limited prior experience failure to achieve anticipated synergies and the impairment of goodwill or other acquisitionrelated intangible assets 

  

legal and regulatory risks 

  

if our products become adulterated misbranded or mislabeled we might   need to recall those items and may experience product liability claims if   consumers or their pets are injured 

  

we may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated misbranded or mislabeled a widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time we could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us a significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity damage to our reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in our products which could have an adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands 

  

new regulations or regulatorybased claims could adversely affect our business 

  

our facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the united states department of agriculture the federal food and drug administration the occupational safety and health administration and other federal state local and foreign governmental agencies relating to the production packaging labelling storage distribution quality and safety of food products and the health and safety of our employees our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits administrative penalties and civil remedies including fines injunctions and recalls of our products we advertise our products and could be the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal state and foreign laws and regulations we may also be subject to new laws or regulations restricting our right to advertise our products including restrictions on the audience to whom products are marketed changes in laws or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements on us could increase our cost of doing business or restrict our actions causing our results of operations to be adversely affected 

  

significant covid19 related changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture sell or distribute our products including quarantines importexport restrictions price controls governmental or regulatory actions closures or other restrictions that limit or close our operating and manufacturing facilities restrict our employees’ ability to travel or perform necessary business functions or otherwise prevent our thirdparty partners suppliers or customers from sufficiently staffing operations including operations necessary for the production distribution sale and support of our products could adversely impact our operations and results 

  

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations our failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits administrative penalties and civil remedies we are currently party to a variety of environmental remediation obligations due to regulatory complexities uncertainties inherent in litigation and the risk of unidentified contaminants on current and former properties of ours the potential exists for remediation liability indemnification and 

  

compliance costs to differ from our estimates we cannot guarantee that our costs in relation to these matters or compliance with environmental laws in general will not exceed our established liabilities or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

  

financial and economic risks 

  

volatility in the market value of derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices will cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings 

  

we utilize derivatives to manage price risk for some of our principal ingredient and energy costs including grains oats wheat and corn oils principally soybean dairy products natural gas and diesel fuel changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded in earnings currently resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings these gains and losses are reported in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of earnings and in unallocated corporate items outside our segment operating results until we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating profit we also record our grain inventories at net realizable value we may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments 

  

economic downturns could limit consumer demand for our products 

  

the willingness of consumers to purchase our products depends in part on local economic conditions in periods of economic uncertainty consumers may purchase more generic private label and other economy brands and may forego certain purchases altogether in those circumstances we could experience a reduction in sales of higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings in addition as a result of economic conditions or competitive actions we may be unable to raise our prices sufficiently to protect margins consumers may also reduce the amount of food that they consume away from home at customers that purchase products from our convenience stores  foodservice segment any of these events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could limit financing and other options and in some cases adversely affect our ability to pay dividends 

  

as of may 30 2021 we had total debt redeemable interests and noncontrolling interests of 135 billion the agreements under which we have issued indebtedness do not prevent us from incurring additional unsecured indebtedness in the future our level of indebtedness may limit our 

  

 ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures or general corporate purposes particularly if the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward and 

 flexibility to adjust to changing business and market conditions and may make us more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions 

  

there are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments and noncontrolling interests if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the related indebtedness and other unrelated indebtedness could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity and our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing may also be adversely affected 

  

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt and other obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control 

  

global capital and credit market issues could negatively affect our liquidity   increase our costs of borrowing and disrupt the operations of our suppliers   and customers 

  

we depend on stable liquid and wellfunctioning capital and credit markets to fund our operations although we believe that our operating cash flows financial assets access to capital and credit markets and revolving credit agreements will permit us to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future there can be no assurance that future volatility or disruption in the capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing we also utilize interest rate derivatives to reduce the volatility of our financing costs if we are not effective in hedging this volatility we may experience an increase in our costs of borrowing our business could also be negatively impacted if our suppliers or customers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy 

  

the covid19 pandemic has increased volatility and pricing in the capital markets we may not have access to preferred sources of liquidity when needed or on terms we find acceptable and our borrowing costs could increase an economic or credit crisis could occur and impair credit availability and our ability to raise capital when needed a disruption in the financial markets may have a 

  

negative effect on our derivative counterparties and could impair our banking or other business partners on whom we rely for access to capital and as counterparties to our derivative contracts 

  

from time to time we issue variable rate securities based on interbank offered rates ibors and enter into interest rate swaps that contain a variable element based on an ibor there is currently uncertainty whether certain ibors will continue to be available after 2021 if certain ibors cease to be available we may need to amend affected agreements and we cannot predict what alternative index would be negotiated with our counterparties and security holders as a result our interest expense could increase and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected 

  

volatility in the securities markets interest rates and other factors could substantially increase our defined benefit   pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit costs 

  

we sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the united states canada and various foreign locations including defined benefit pension retiree health and welfare severance and other postemployment plans our major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments changes in interest rates mortality rates health care costs early retirement rates investment returns and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plans a significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations 

  

a change in the assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses or a different weightedaverage cost of capital used to value our reporting units or our indefinitelived intangible assets could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth 

  

as of may 30 2021 we had 207 billion of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets goodwill for each of our reporting units is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred we compare the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill to the fair value of the reporting unit if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill impairment has occurred our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our longrange planning process we also make estimates of discount rates perpetuity growth assumptions market comparables and other factors if current expectations for growth rates for sales and profits are not met or other market factors and macroeconomic conditions that could be affected by the covid19 pandemic or otherwise were to change then our reporting units could become significantly impaired our europe  australia reporting unit had experienced declining business performance and we continue to monitor this business while we currently believe that our goodwill is not impaired different assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses could result in significant impairment losses 

  

we evaluate the useful lives of our intangible assets primarily intangible assets associated with the blue buffalo  pillsbury  totino’s  progresso  yoplait  old el paso  yoki  häagendazs  and annie’s brands to determine if they are finite or indefinitelived reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry known technological advances legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 

  

our indefinitelived intangible assets are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred our estimate of the fair value of the brands is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs including projected revenues from our longrange plan assumed royalty rates which could be payable if we did not own the brands and a discount rate if current expectations for growth rates for sales and margins are not met or other market factors and macroeconomic conditions that could be affected by the covid19 pandemic or otherwise were to change then our indefinitelived intangible assets could become significantly impaired our progresso  green giant  and epic brands had experienced declining business performance and we continue to monitor these businesses

 item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

executive overview 

  

we are a global packaged foods company we develop distinctive valueadded food products and market them under unique brand names we work continuously to improve our core products and to create new products that meet consumers’ evolving needs and preferences in addition we build the equity of our brands over time with strong consumerdirected marketing innovative new products and effective merchandising we believe our brandbuilding approach is the key to winning and sustaining leading share positions in markets around the globe 

  

our fundamental financial goal is to generate competitively differentiated returns for our shareholders over the long term we believe achieving that goal requires us to generate a consistent balance of net sales growth margin expansion cash conversion and cash return to shareholders over time 

  

our longterm growth objectives are to deliver the following performance on average over time 

  

 2 to 3 percent annual growth in organic net sales 

 midsingledigit annual growth in adjusted operating profit 

 mid to highsingledigit annual growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share eps 

 free cash flow conversion of at least 95 percent of adjusted net earnings after tax and 

 cash return to shareholders of 80 to 90 percent of free cash flow including an attractive dividend yield 

  

we are executing our accelerate strategy to drive sustainable profitable growth and toptier shareholder returns over the long term the strategy focuses on four pillars to create competitive advantages and win boldly building brands relentlessly innovating unleashing our scale and being a force for good we are prioritizing our core markets global platforms and local gem brands that have the best prospects for profitable growth and we are committed to reshaping our portfolio with strategic acquisitions and divestitures to further enhance our growth profile 

  

we expect that changes in consumer behaviors driven by the covid19 pandemic will result in ongoing elevated consumer demand for food at home relative to prepandemic levels these changes include more time spent working from home and increased consumer appreciation for cooking and baking we plan to capitalize on these opportunities addressing evolving consumer needs through our leading brands innovation and advantaged capabilities to generate profitable growth 

  

in fiscal 2021 we executed well amid the uncertain environment caused by the pandemic delivering strong growth in organic net sales adjusted operating profit and adjusted diluted eps we achieved each of the three priorities we established at the beginning of the year 

  

we competed effectively everywhere we play highlighted by market share gains across each of our five global platforms cereal pet food ice cream snack bars and mexican food our positive market share performance amid pandemicdriven elevated demand for food at home helped drive organic net sales growth in our north america retail europe  australia and asia  latin america segments conversely lower awayfromhome food demand stemming from the pandemic resulted in a decline in organic net sales for our convenience stores  foodservice segment for our pet segment which was largely unaffected by the pandemic we were able to generate organic net sales growth despite the comparison against an extra month of results in the prior year 

  

we drove efficiency to fuel investment in our brands and capabilities we generated strong levels of holistic margin management hmm cost savings and were able to meaningfully increase our investment in brand building activities and in strategic capabilities such as ecommerce digital data  analytics and strategic revenue management 

  

we reduced our debt leverage and increased our financial flexibility as a result of our continued cash discipline we were able to reduce our debt and generate a reduction in our leverage ratio due to our improved balance sheet position we were able to resume dividend growth and share repurchase activity during fiscal 2021 

  

we also announced important transactions during fiscal 2021 intended to reshape our portfolio for growth in line with our accelerate strategy in march 2021 we announced the proposed sale of our european yoplait operations to sodiaal in exchange for full ownership of the canadian yoplait business and a reduced royalty rate for the use of the yoplait and liberté brands in the united states and canada the proposed transaction would be anticipated to close by the end of calendar 2021 subject to appropriate labor consultations regulatory filings and other customary closing conditions in may 2021 we reached a definitive agreement to acquire tyson foods’ pet treats business for 12 billion in cash the acquisition is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions 

  

  

our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2021 rose 3 percent to 181 billion on an organic basis net sales increased 4 percent compared to yearago levels operating profit of 31 billion increased 6 percent adjusted operating profit of 32 billion increased 2 percent on a constantcurrency basis diluted eps of 378 was up 6 percent compared to fiscal 2020 results adjusted diluted eps of 379 increased 4 percent on a constantcurrency basis see the “nongaap measures” section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap 

  

net cash provided by operations totaled 30 billion in fiscal 2021 representing a conversion rate of 127 percent of net earnings including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests this cash generation supported capital investments totaling 531 million and our resulting free cash flow was 24 billion at a conversion rate of 103 percent of adjusted net earnings including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests we returned cash to shareholders through dividends totaling 12 billion and share repurchases totaling 301 million and we reduced total debt outstanding by 928 million our ratio of net debttooperating cash flow was 37 in fiscal 2021 and our net debttoadjusted earnings before net interest income taxes depreciation and amortization net debttoadjusted ebitda ratio was 29 see the “nongaap measures” section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by gaap 

  

a detailed review of our fiscal 2021 performance compared to fiscal 2020 appears below in the section titled “fiscal 2021 consolidated results of operations” a detailed review of our fiscal 2020 performance compared to our fiscal 2019 performance is set forth in part ii item 7 of our form 10k for the fiscal year ended may 31 2020 under the caption “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – fiscal 2020 results of consolidated operations” which is incorporated herein by reference 

  

in fiscal 2022 we expect to continue to compete effectively in a dynamic environment work aggressively to navigate a turbulent cost environment and successfully execute our portfolio and organization reshaping actions we expect the largest factors impacting our performance will be the relative balance of athome versus awayfromhome consumer food demand and the inflationary cost environment both of which remain uncertain we expect athome food demand will decline year over year across most of our core markets though will remain above prepandemic levels conversely we expect awayfromhome food demand to continue to recover though not fully to prepandemic levels with roughly 85 percent of our net sales representing athome food occasions we expect these dynamics to result in lower aggregate consumer demand in our categories in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 levels 

  

total input cost inflation is expected to be approximately 7 percent of cost of goods sold in fiscal 2022 we are addressing the inflationary environment with strong hmm cost savings expected to total roughly 4 percent of cost of goods sold and with positive net price realization generated through our strategic revenue management capability 

  

based on these assumptions our key fullyear fiscal 2022 targets are summarized below 

  

 organic net sales are expected to decline 1 to 3 percent which is generally in line with the expected level of aggregate category demand in fiscal 2022 

 constantcurrency adjusted operating profit is expected to decline 2 to 4 percent from the base of 32 billion reported in fiscal 2021 

 constantcurrency adjusted diluted eps are expected to range between flat and down 2 percent from the base of 379 earned in fiscal 2021 

 relative to prepandemic levels in fiscal 2019 the midpoints of these fiscal 2022 guidance ranges equate to 3year compound annual growth rates of approximately 2 percent for organic net sales approximately 2 percent for constantcurrency adjusted operating profit and approximately 5 percent for constantcurrency adjusted diluted eps 

 free cash flow conversion is expected to be approximately 95 percent of adjusted aftertax earnings

in fiscal 2021 unallocated corporate expense decreased 297 million to 212 million compared to 509 million last year in fiscal 2021 we recorded a 139 million net decrease in expense related to marktomarket valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories compared to a 25 million net increase in expense in the prior year in addition we recorded 2 million of restructuring charges in cost of sales in fiscal 2021 compared to 26 million of restructuring charges and 2 million of restructuring initiative projectrelated costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2020 we also recorded a 4 million favorable adjustment related to a product recall in our international green giant business in fiscal 2021 compared to a 19 million charge in fiscal 2020 in fiscal 2021 we recorded 76 million of net gains related to valuation adjustments and the gain on sale of certain corporate investments compared to 8 million of net losses related to valuation adjustments and the loss on sale of certain corporate investments in fiscal 2020 in fiscal 2021 we recorded 10 million of transaction costs related to our nonbinding memorandum of understanding to sell our 51 percent controlling interest in our european yoplait business and our planned acquisition of tyson foods’ pet treats business in addition we recorded a 9 million gain related to a brazil indirect tax item in fiscal 2021 

  

  

impact of inflation 

  

we experienced input cost inflation of 4 percent in fiscal 2021 and 4 percent in fiscal 2020 primarily on commodity inputs we expect input cost inflation of approximately 7 percent in fiscal 2022 we attempt to minimize the effects of inflation through hmm strategic revenue management planning and operating practices our risk management practices are discussed in item 7a of this report 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

the primary source of our liquidity is cash flow from operations over the most recent twoyear period our operations have generated 66 billion in cash a substantial portion of this operating cash flow has been returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases we also use cash from operations to fund our capital expenditures and acquisitions we typically use a combination of cash notes payable and longterm debt and occasionally issue shares of common stock to finance significant acquisitions our sources of liquidity were not materially impacted from the covid19 pandemic 

  

as of may 30 2021 we had 687 million of cash and cash equivalents held in foreign jurisdictions in anticipation of repatriating funds from foreign jurisdictions we record local country withholding taxes on our international earnings as applicable we may repatriate our cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries without such funds being subject to further us income tax liability earnings prior to fiscal 2018 from our foreign subsidiaries remain permanently reinvested in those jurisdictions 

  

cash flows from operations 

  

   

during fiscal 2021 cash provided by operations was 2983 million compared to 3676 million in the same period last year the 693 million decrease was primarily driven by a 950 million change in current assets and liabilities partially offset by a 148 million change in deferred income taxes and a 135 million increase in net earnings the 950 million change in current assets and liabilities was primarily driven by a 458 million change in inventory balances and a 296 million change in other current liabilities primarily driven by changes in income taxes payable incentive accruals and trade and advertising accruals 

  

we strive to grow core working capital at or below the rate of growth in our net sales for fiscal 2021 core working capital increased 6 percent compared to a net sales increase of 3 percent as of may 30 2021 our core working capital balance was a net liability of 194 million compared to a net liability of 206 million in fiscal 2020 the 12 million change was primarily due to lower inventory balances in fiscal 2020 driven by the surge in athome demand at the outset of the pandemic partially offset by an increase in accounts payable in fiscal 2021 due to increased costs incurred to service demand in fiscal 2020 core working capital decreased 591 million compared to a net sales increase of 5 percent 

  

  

cash flows from investing activities 

  

   

in fiscal 2021 we used 513 million of cash through investing activities compared to 486 million in fiscal 2020 we invested 531 million in land buildings and equipment in fiscal 2021 an increase of 70 million from fiscal 2020 

  

we expect capital expenditures to be approximately 35 percent of reported net sales in fiscal 2022 these expenditures will fund initiatives that are expected to fuel growth support innovative products and continue hmm initiatives throughout the supply chain 

  

cash flows from financing activities 

  

   

financing activities used 27 billion of cash in fiscal 2021 compared to 19 billion in fiscal 2020 we had 961 million of net debt repayments in fiscal 2021 compared to 917 million of net debt repayments in fiscal 2020 in addition we paid a participation incentive of 201 million related to a debt exchange in fiscal 2021 for more information on our debt issuances and payments please refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

  

during fiscal 2021 we received 74 million of net proceeds from common stock issued on exercised options compared to 263 million in fiscal 2020 

  

during fiscal 2021 we repurchased 5 million shares of our common stock for 301 million share repurchases in fiscal 2020 were insignificant 

  

dividends paid in fiscal 2021 totaled 1246 million or 202 per share dividends paid in fiscal 2020 totaled 1196 million or 196 per share 

  

  

selected cash flows from joint ventures 

  

selected cash flows from our joint ventures are set forth in the following table 

  

   

  

the following table details the feepaid committed and uncommitted credit lines we had available as of may 30 2021 

  

   

to ensure availability of funds we maintain bank credit lines and have commercial paper programs available to us in the united states and europe in response to uncertainty surrounding the availability and cost of commercial paper borrowings as a result of the covid19 pandemic we issued 750 million of fixedrate notes in april 2020 and reduced our borrowings under commercial paper programs as the covid19 pandemic evolves we will continue to evaluate its impact to our sources of liquidity we also have uncommitted and assetbacked credit lines that support our foreign operations 

  

we have material contractual obligations that arise in the normal course of business and we believe that cash flows from operations will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for at least the next 12 months 

  

certain of our longterm debt agreements our credit facilities and our noncontrolling interests contain restrictive covenants as of may 30 2021 we were in compliance with all of these covenants 

  

we have 2464 million of longterm debt maturing in the next 12 months that is classified as current including €200 million of 22 percent fixedrate notes due june 2021 €500 million of 00 percent fixedrate notes due august 2021 €500 million of 00 percent fixedrate notes due november 2021 and 1 billion of 315 percent fixedrate notes due december 2021 we believe that cash flows from operations together with available short and longterm debt financing will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for at least the next 12 months 

  

as of may 30 2021 our total debt including the impact of derivative instruments designated as hedges was 88 percent in fixedrate and 12 percent in floatingrate instruments compared to 87 percent in fixedrate and 13 percent in floatingrate instruments on may 31 2020 

  

our net debt to operating cash flow ratio increased to 37 in fiscal 2021 from 32 in fiscal 2020 primarily driven by a decrease in cash provided by operations our net debttoadjusted ebitda ratio declined to 29 in fiscal 2021 from 32 in fiscal 2020 see the “nongaap measures” section below for our use of this measure not defined by gaap 

  

we have a 51 percent controlling interest in yoplait sas and a 50 percent interest in yoplait marques snc and liberté marques sàrl sodiaal international sodiaal holds the remaining interests in each of these entities we consolidate these entities into our consolidated financial statements we record sodiaal’s 50 percent interest in yoplait marques snc and liberté marques sàrl as noncontrolling interests and its 49 percent interest in yoplait sas as a redeemable interest on our consolidated balance sheets these euro and canadian dollardenominated interests are reported in us dollars on our consolidated balance sheets sodiaal has the ability to put all or a portion of its redeemable interest to us at fair value once per year up to three times before december 2024 as of may 30 2021 the redemption value of the redeemable interest was 605 million which approximates its fair value 

  

in march 2021 we entered into a nonbinding memorandum of understanding to sell our 51 percent controlling interest in our european yoplait business to sodiaal as part of the proposed transaction we would obtain sodiaal’s 49 percent ownership interest in our canadian yogurt business making the canadian yogurt business a wholly owned subsidiary the proposed transaction would be anticipated to close in fiscal 2022 subject to labor consultations regulatory filings and other customary closing conditions 

  

the thirdparty holder of the general mills cereals llc gmc class a interests receives quarterly preferred distributions from available net income based on the application of a floating preferred return rate to the holder’s capital account balance established in the most recent marktomarket valuation currently 252 million on june 1 2021 the floating preferred return rate on gmc’s class a interests was reset to the sum of threemonth libor plus 160 basis points the preferred return rate is adjusted every three years through a negotiated agreement with the class a interest holder or through a remarketing auction 

  

we have an option to purchase the class a interests for consideration equal to the then current capital account value plus any unpaid preferred return and the prescribed makewhole amount if we purchase these interests any change in the thirdparty holder’s capital account from its original value will be charged directly to retained earnings and will increase or decrease the net earnings used to calculate eps in that period 

  

  

critical accounting estimates 

  

for a complete description of our significant accounting policies please see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report our critical accounting estimates are those that have a meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations these estimates include our accounting for revenue recognition valuation of longlived assets intangible assets redeemable interest stockbased compensation income taxes and defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plans 

  

considerations related to the covid19 pandemic 

the continuing impact that the recent covid19 pandemic will have on our consolidated results of operations is uncertain we saw increased orders from retail customers across all geographies in response to increased consumer demand for food at home we also experienced a covid19related decrease in consumer traffic in awayfromhome food outlets in fiscal 2022 we expect athome food demand will decline year over year across most of our core markets though will remain above prepandemic levels conversely we expect awayfrom home food demand to continue to recover though not fully to prepandemic levels we expect one of the largest factors impacting our performance will be relative balance of athome versus awayfromhome consumer food demand primarily driven by the level of virus control in markets around the world which remains uncertain we have considered the potential impacts of the covid19 pandemic in our significant accounting estimates as of may 30 2021 and will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our business and consolidated results of operations 

  

revenue recognition 

our revenues are reported net of variable consideration and consideration payable to our customers including trade promotion consumer coupon redemption and other reductions to the transaction price including estimated allowances for returns unsalable product and prompt pay discounts trade promotions are recorded using significant judgment of estimated participation and performance levels for offered programs at the time of sale differences between the estimated and actual reduction to the transaction price are recognized as a change in estimate in a subsequent period our accrued trade and coupon promotion liabilities were 508 million as of may 30 2021 and 471 million as of may 31 2020 because these amounts are significant if our estimates are inaccurate we would have to make adjustments in subsequent periods that could have a significant effect on our results of operations 

  

valuation of longlived assets 

we estimate the useful lives of longlived assets and make estimates concerning undiscounted cash flows to review for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent appraisals as appropriate 

  

intangible assets 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are not subject to amortization and are tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred our estimates of fair value for goodwill impairment testing are determined based on a discounted cash flow model we use inputs from our longrange planning process to determine growth rates for sales and profits we also make estimates of discount rates perpetuity growth assumptions market comparables and other factors 

  

we evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets mainly brands to determine if they are finite or indefinitelived reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry known technological advances legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets intangible assets that are deemed to have finite lives are amortized on a straightline basis over their useful lives generally ranging from 4 to 30 years our estimate of the fair value of our brand assets is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs which include projected revenues from our longrange plan assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands and a discount rate 

  

as of may 30 2021 we had 21 billion of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets while we currently believe that the fair value of each intangible exceeds its carrying value and that those intangibles will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses or a different weightedaverage cost of capital could result in material impairment losses and amortization expense we performed our fiscal 2021 assessment of our intangible assets as of the first day of the second quarter of fiscal 2021 and we determined there was no impairment of our intangible assets as their related fair values were substantially in excess of the carrying values 

  

while having significant coverage as of our fiscal 2021 assessment date the europe  australia reporting unit and the progresso  green giant  and epic brand intangible assets had risk of decreasing coverage we will continue to monitor these businesses for potential impairment 

  

  

redeemable interest 

the significant assumptions used to estimate the redemption value of the redeemable interest include projected revenue growth and profitability from our longrange plan capital spending depreciation and taxes foreign currency exchange rates and a discount rate as of may 30 2021 the redemption value of the redeemable interest was 605 million 

  

stockbased compensation 

the valuation of stock options is a significant accounting estimate that requires us to use judgments and assumptions that are likely to have a material impact on our financial statements annually we make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility employee exercise behavior dividend yield and the forfeiture rate for more information on these assumptions please see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

  

the estimated fair values of stock options granted and the assumptions used for the blackscholes optionpricing model were as follows 

  

   

the riskfree interest rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based on the us treasury zerocoupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant an increase in the expected term by 1 year leaving all other assumptions constant would increase the grant date fair value by less than 1 percent if all other assumptions are held constant a one percentage point increase in our fiscal 2021 volatility assumption would increase the grant date fair value of our fiscal 2021 option awards by 7 percent 

  

to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our assumptions we are not required to true up grantdate fair valuebased expense to final intrinsic values historical data has a significant bearing on our forwardlooking assumptions significant variances between actual and predicted experience could lead to prospective revisions in our assumptions which could then significantly impact the yearoveryear comparability of stockbased compensation expense 

  

any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings referred to as a windfall tax benefit is presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows as an operating cash flow the actual impact on future years’ cash flows will depend in part on the volume of employee stock option exercises during a particular year and the relationship between the exercisedate market value of the underlying stock and the original grantdate fair value previously determined for financial reporting purposes 

  

realized windfall tax benefits and shortfall tax deficiencies related to the exercise or vesting of stockbased awards are recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings because employee stock option exercise behavior is not within our control it is possible that significantly different reported results could occur if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail 

  

income taxes 

we apply a morelikelythannot threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions accordingly we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement future changes in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect earnings in the period of such change for more information on income taxes please see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

  

defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plans 

we have defined benefit pension plans covering many employees in the united states canada switzerland france and the united kingdom we also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to many of our retirees in the united states canada and brazil under certain circumstances we also provide accruable benefits primarily severance to former and inactive employees in the united states canada and mexico please see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for a description of our defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plans 

  

we recognize benefits provided during retirement or following employment over the plan participants’ active working lives accordingly we make various assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement of our obligations assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our net 

  

periodic benefit expense or income and accumulated benefit obligations include the longterm rates of return on plan assets the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our benefit plans and health care cost trend rates 

  

expected rate of return on plan assets 

  

our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation our historical longterm investment performance our estimate of future longterm returns by asset class using input from our actuaries investment services and investment managers and longterm inflation assumptions we review this assumption annually for each plan however our annual investment performance for one particular year does not by itself significantly influence our evaluation 

  

our historical investment returns compound annual growth rates for our united states defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets were 114 percent 108 percent 93 percent 80 percent and 83 percent for the 1 5 10 15 and 20 year periods ended may 30 2021 

  

on a weightedaverage basis the expected rate of return for all defined benefit plans was 572 percent for fiscal 2021 695 percent for fiscal 2020 and 725 percent for fiscal 2019 for fiscal 2022 we increased our weightedaverage expected rate of return on plan assets for our principal defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in the united states to 596 percent due to expected longterm asset returns 

  

lowering the expected longterm rate of return on assets by 100 basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense by 72 million for fiscal 2022 a marketrelated valuation basis is used to reduce yeartoyear expense volatility the marketrelated valuation recognizes certain investment gains or losses over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the marketrelated value of assets and the actual return based on the marketrelated value of assets our outside actuaries perform these calculations as part of our determination of annual expense or income 

  

discount rates 

  

we estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic benefit expense for our united states and most of our international defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plans utilizing a full yield curve approach by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of may 31 for our defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plan obligations we work with our outside actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan participants and using the aa above median corporate bond yield to develop a forward interest rate curve including a margin to that index based on our credit risk this forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions 

  

our weightedaverage discount rates were as follows 

  

   

lowering the discount rates by 100 basis points would increase our net defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plan expense for fiscal 2022 by approximately 54 million all obligationrelated experience gains and losses are amortized using a straightline method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants or over the average remaining lifetime of the remaining plan participants if the plan is viewed as “all or almost all” inactive participants 

  

health care cost trend rates 

  

we review our health care cost trend rates annually our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims experience and information provided by our actuaries this information includes recent plan experience plan design overall industry experience 

  

and projections and assumptions used by other similar organizations our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with this review recent experiences and shortterm expectations our initial health care cost trend rate assumption is 63 percent for retirees age 65 and over and 60 percent for retirees under age 65 at the end of fiscal 2021 rates are graded down annually until the ultimate trend rate of 45 percent is reached in 2029 for all retirees the trend rates are applicable for calculations only if the retirees’ benefits increase as a result of health care inflation the ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually as necessary to approximate the current economic view on the rate of longterm inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium assumed trend rates for health care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans 

  

any arising health care claims costrelated experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculation of expected future claims once recognized experience gains and losses are amortized using a straightline method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants or over the average remaining lifetime of the remaining plan participants if the plan is viewed as “all or almost all” inactive participants 

  

financial statement impact 

  

in fiscal 2021 we recorded net defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plan expense of 4 million compared to 2 million of income in fiscal 2020 and 24 million of expense in fiscal 2019 as of may 30 2021 we had cumulative unrecognized actuarial net losses of 2 billion on our defined benefit pension plans and cumulative unrecognized actuarial net gains of 179 million on our postretirement and postemployment benefit plans mainly as the result of liability increases from lower interest rates partially offset by recent increases in the values of plan assets these unrecognized actuarial net losses will result in increases in our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses because they currently exceed the corridors defined by gaap 

  

actual future net defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plan income or expense will depend on investment performance changes in future discount rates changes in health care cost trend rates and other factors related to the populations participating in these plans 

  

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

  

in march 2020 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued optional accounting guidance for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform the new standard provides expedients and exceptions to existing accounting requirements for contract modifications and hedge accounting related to transitioning from discontinued reference rates such as libor to alternative reference rates if certain criteria are met the new accounting requirements can be applied as of the beginning of the interim period including march 12 2020 or any date thereafter through december 31 2022 we are in the process of reviewing our contracts and arrangements that will be affected by a discontinued reference rate and are analyzing the impact of this guidance on our results of operations and financial position 

  

nongaap measures 

  

we have included in this report measures of financial performance that are not defined by gaap we believe that these measures provide useful information to investors and include these measures in other communications to investors 

  

for each of these nongaap financial measures we are providing below a reconciliation of the differences between the nongaap measure and the most directly comparable gaap measure an explanation of why we believe the nongaap measure provides useful information to investors and any additional material purposes for which our management or board of directors uses the nongaap measure these nongaap measures should be viewed in addition to and not in lieu of the comparable gaap measure 

  

several measures below are presented on an adjusted basis the adjustments are either items resulting from infrequently occurring events or items that in management’s judgment significantly affect the yeartoyear assessment of operating results 

  

organic net sales growth rates 

  

we provide organic net sales growth rates for our consolidated net sales and segment net sales this measure is used in reporting to our board of directors and executive management and as a component of the measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes we believe that organic net sales growth rates provide useful information to investors because they provide transparency to underlying performance in our net sales by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as acquisitions divestitures and a 53 rd week when applicable have on yeartoyear comparability a reconciliation of these measures to reported net sales growth rates the relevant gaap measures are included in our consolidated results of operations and results of segment operations discussions in the mda above 

  

  

  

adjusted operating profit growth on a constantcurrency basis 

  

this measure is used in reporting to our board of directors and executive management and as a component of the measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes we believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is the operating profit measure we use to evaluate operating profit performance on a comparable yeartoyear basis additionally the measure is evaluated on a constantcurrency basis by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on yeartoyear comparability given the volatility in foreign currency exchange rates 

  

our adjusted operating profit growth on a constantcurrency basis is calculated as follows

forwardlooking financial measures 

  

our fiscal 2022 outlook for organic net sales growth constantcurrency adjusted operating profit adjusted diluted eps and free cash flow are nongaap financial measures that exclude or have otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability including the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations restructuring charges and projectrelated costs acquisition transaction and integration costs acquisitions divestitures and marktomarket effects we are not able to reconcile these forwardlooking nongaap financial measures to their most directly comparable forwardlooking gaap financial measures without unreasonable efforts because we are unable to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the actual impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices or the timing or impact of acquisitions divestitures and restructuring actions throughout fiscal 2022 the unavailable information could have a significant impact on our fiscal 2022 gaap financial results

 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

we are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates and commodity and equity prices changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows in the normal course of business we actively manage our exposure to these market risks by entering into various hedging transactions authorized under established policies that place controls on these activities the counterparties in these transactions are generally highly rated institutions we establish credit limits for each counterparty our hedging transactions include but are not limited to a variety of derivative financial instruments for information on interest rate foreign exchange commodity price and equity instrument risk please see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

  

value at risk 

  

the estimates in the table below are intended to measure the maximum potential fair value we could lose in one day from adverse changes in market interest rates foreign exchange rates commodity prices and equity prices under normal market conditions a monte carlo valueatrisk var methodology was used to quantify the market risk for our exposures the models assumed normal market conditions and used a 95 percent confidence level 

  

the var calculation used historical interest and foreign exchange rates and commodity and equity prices from the past year to estimate the potential volatility and correlation of these rates in the future the market data were drawn from the riskmetrics ™ data set the calculations are not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that we expect to incur further since the hedging instrument the derivative inversely correlates with the underlying exposure we would expect that any loss or gain in the fair value of 

  

our derivatives would be generally offset by an increase or decrease in the fair value of the underlying exposure the positions included in the calculations were debt investments interest rate swaps foreign exchange forwards commodity swaps futures and options and equity instruments the calculations do not include the underlying foreign exchange and commodities or equityrelated positions that are offset by these marketrisksensitive instruments

 item 1a  risk factors 

  

our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties any of the risks described below could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

global health developments and economic uncertainty resulting from the covid19 pandemic could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

the public health crisis caused by the covid19 pandemic and the measures being taken by governments businesses including us and the public at large to limit covid19’s spread have had and we expect will continue to have certain negative impacts on our business financial condition and results of operations including without limitation the following 

  

 we have experienced and may continue to experience a decrease in sales of certain of our products in markets around the world that have been affected by the covid19 pandemic in particular sales of our products in the awayfromhome food outlets across all our major markets have been negatively affected by reduced consumer traffic resulting from shelterinplace regulations or recommendations and closings of restaurants schools and cafeterias if the covid19 pandemic persists or intensifies its negative impacts on our sales particularly in awayfromhome food outlets could be more prolonged and may become more severe 

 deteriorating economic and political conditions in our major markets affected by the covid19 pandemic such as increased unemployment decreases in disposable income declines in consumer confidence or economic slowdowns or recessions could cause a decrease in demand for our products 

 we have experienced minor temporary workforce disruptions in our supply chain as a result of the covid19 pandemic we have implemented employee safety measures based on guidance from the centers for disease control and prevention and world health organization across all our supply chain facilities including proper hygiene social distancing mask use and temperature screenings these measures may not be sufficient to prevent the spread of covid19 among our employees illness travel restrictions absenteeism or other workforce disruptions could negatively affect our supply chain manufacturing distribution or other business processes we may face additional production disruptions in the future which may place constraints on our ability to produce products in a timely manner or may increase our costs 

 changes and volatility in consumer purchasing and consumption patterns may increase demand for our products in one quarter such as occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 resulting in decreased consumer demand for our products in subsequent quarters while we experienced increased demand for our products in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 this increase may moderate or reverse if consumers alter their purchasing habits short term or sustained increases in consumer demand at our retail customers may exceed our production capacity or otherwise strain our supply chain 

 the failure of third parties on which we rely including those third parties who supply our ingredients packaging capital equipment and other necessary operating materials contract manufacturers distributors contractors commercial banks and external business partners to meet their obligations to us or significant disruptions in their ability to do so may negatively impact our operations 

  

 significant changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture sell or distribute our products including quarantines importexport restrictions price controls governmental or regulatory actions closures or other restrictions that limit or close our operating and manufacturing facilities restrict our employees’ ability to travel or perform necessary business functions or otherwise prevent our thirdparty partners suppliers or customers from sufficiently staffing operations including operations necessary for the production distribution and sale of our products could adversely impact our operations and results 

 actions we have taken or may take or decisions we have made or may make as a consequence of the covid19 pandemic may result in investigations legal claims or litigation against us 

  

the categories in which we participate are very competitive and if we are not able to compete effectively our results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

the consumer and pet food categories in which we participate are very competitive our principal competitors in these categories are manufacturers as well as retailers with their own branded and private label products competitors market and sell their products through brickandmortar stores and ecommerce all of our principal competitors have substantial financial marketing and other resources in most product categories we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products but also with regional brands and with generic and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices competition in our product categories is based on product innovation product quality price brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing promotional activity convenient ordering and delivery to the consumer and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences if our large competitors were to seek an advantage through pricing or promotional changes we could choose to do the same which could adversely affect our margins and profitability if we did not do the same our revenues and market share could be adversely affected our market share and revenue growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing innovative products in response to changing consumer demands or by new product introductions of our competitors if we are unable to build and sustain brand equity by offering recognizably superior product quality we may be unable to maintain premium pricing over generic and private label products 

  

we may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face of a consolidating retail environment 

  

there has been significant consolidation in the grocery industry resulting in customers with increased purchasing power in addition large retail customers may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency lower pricing increased reliance on their own brand name products increased emphasis on generic and other economy brands and increased promotional programs if we are unable to use our scale marketing expertise product innovation knowledge of consumers’ needs and category leadership positions to respond to these demands our profitability and volume growth could be negatively impacted in addition the loss of any large customer could adversely affect our sales and profits in fiscal 2020 walmart accounted for 21 percent of our consolidated net sales and 30 percent of net sales of our north america retail segment for more information on significant customers please see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

  

price changes for the commodities we depend on for raw materials packaging and energy may adversely affect our profitability 

  

the principal raw materials that we use are commodities that experience price volatility caused by external conditions such as weather climate change product scarcity limited sources of supply commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations trade tariffs pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations commodity prices have become and may continue to be more volatile during the covid19 pandemic commodity price changes may result in unexpected increases in raw material packaging and energy costs if we are unable to increase productivity to offset these increased costs or increase our prices we may experience reduced margins and profitability we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and the risk management procedures that we do use may not always work as we intend 

  

volatility in the market value of derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices will cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings 

  

we utilize derivatives to manage price risk for some of our principal ingredient and energy costs including grains oats wheat and corn oils principally soybean dairy products natural gas and diesel fuel changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded in earnings currently resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings these gains and losses are reported in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of earnings and in unallocated corporate items outside our segment operating results until we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating profit we also record our grain inventories at net realizable value we may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments 

  

  

if we are not efficient in our production our profitability could suffer as a result of the highly competitive environment in which we operate 

  

our future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to be efficient in the production and manufacture of our products in highly competitive markets gaining additional efficiencies may become more difficult over time our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or by eliminating redundant costs resulting from acquisitions or divestitures could adversely affect our profitability and weaken our competitive position many productivity initiatives involve complex reorganization of manufacturing facilities and production lines such manufacturing realignment may result in the interruption of production which may negatively impact product volume and margins we periodically engage in restructuring and cost savings initiatives designed to increase our efficiency and reduce expenses if we are unable to execute those initiatives as planned we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

disruption of our supply chain could adversely affect our business 

  

our ability to make move and sell products is critical to our success damage or disruption to raw material supplies or our manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather climate change natural disaster fire terrorism cyberattack pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic governmental restrictions or mandates strikes importexport restrictions or other factors could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products many of our product lines are manufactured at a single location or sourced from a single supplier the failure of third parties on which we rely including those third parties who supply our ingredients packaging capital equipment and other necessary operating materials contract manufacturers distributors contractors and external business partners to meet their obligations to us or significant disruptions in their ability to do so may negatively impact our operations our suppliers’ policies and practices can damage our reputation and the quality and safety of our products disputes with significant suppliers including disputes regarding pricing or performance could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers and could materially and adversely affect our sales financial condition and results of operations failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or to effectively manage such events if they occur particularly when a product is sourced from a single location or supplier could adversely affect our business and results of operations as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain 

  

we have experienced minor temporary workforce disruptions in our supply chain as a result of the covid19 pandemic we have implemented employee safety measures based on guidance from the centers for disease control and prevention and world health organization across all our supply chain facilities including proper hygiene social distancing mask use and temperature screenings these measures may not be sufficient to prevent the spread of covid19 among our employees illness travel restrictions absenteeism or other workforce disruptions could negatively affect our supply chain manufacturing distribution or other business processes we may face additional production disruptions in the future which may place constraints on our ability to produce products in a timely manner or may increase our costs 

  

we experienced increased demand for our products in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and were and continue to be unable to fill all customer orders short term or sustained increases in consumer demand at our retail customers may exceed our production capacity or otherwise strain our supply chain our failure to meet the demand for our products could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

concerns with the safety and quality of our products could cause consumers to avoid certain products or ingredients 

  

we could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain of our products or ingredients adverse publicity about these types of concerns whether or not valid may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions 

  

if our products become adulterated misbranded or mislabeled we might need to recall those items and may experience product liability claims if consumers or their pets are injured 

  

we may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated misbranded or mislabeled a widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time we could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us a significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity damage to our reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in our products which could have an adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands 

  

  

we may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and trends which may result in decreased demand for our products 

  

our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes eating habits and purchasing behaviors of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences in channels where they shop consumer preferences and categorylevel consumption may change from time to time and can be affected by a number of different trends and other factors if we fail to anticipate identify or react to these changes and trends such as adapting to emerging ecommerce channels or to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis we may experience reduced demand for our products which would in turn cause our revenues and profitability to suffer similarly demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns regarding the health effects of ingredients such as sodium trans fats genetically modified organisms sugar processed wheat grainfree or legumerich pet food or other product ingredients or attributes 

  

we may be unable to grow our market share or add products that are in faster growing and more profitable categories 

  

the food industry’s growth potential is constrained by population growth our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business faster than populations are growing in the markets that we serve one way to achieve that growth is to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new products in faster growing and more profitable categories our future results will also depend on our ability to increase market share in our existing product categories if we do not succeed in developing innovative products for new and existing categories our growth and profitability could be adversely affected 

  

economic downturns could limit consumer demand for our products 

  

the willingness of consumers to purchase our products depends in part on local economic conditions in periods of economic uncertainty consumers may purchase more generic private label and other economy brands and may forego certain purchases altogether in those circumstances we could experience a reduction in sales of higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings in addition as a result of economic conditions or competitive actions we may be unable to raise our prices sufficiently to protect margins consumers may also reduce the amount of food that they consume away from home at customers that purchase products from our convenience stores  foodservice segment any of these events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

deteriorating economic and political conditions in our major markets affected by the covid19 pandemic such as increased unemployment decreases in disposable income declines in consumer confidence or economic slowdowns or recessions could cause a decrease in demand for our products 

  

our results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands 

  

maintaining and continually enhancing the value of our many iconic brands is critical to the success of our business the value of our brands is based in large part on the degree to which consumers react and respond positively to these brands brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner adverse publicity about our products our failure to maintain the quality of our products the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences concerns about food safety or our products becoming unavailable to consumers consumer demand for our products may also be impacted by changes in the level of advertising or promotional support the use of social and digital media by consumers us and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared negative posts or comments about us our brands or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation if we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands our business results could be negatively impacted 

  

our international operations are subject to political and economic risks 

  

in fiscal 2020 24 percent of our consolidated net sales were generated outside of the united states we are accordingly subject to a number of risks relating to doing business internationally any of which could significantly harm our business these risks include 

  

 political and economic instability 

 exchange controls and currency exchange rates 

 tariffs on products and ingredients that we import and export 

 nationalization or government control of operations 

 compliance with anticorruption regulations 

 uncertainty relating to the impact of the united kingdom’s exit from the european union 

 foreign tax treaties and policies and 

 restriction on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries including potentially negative tax consequences 

  

  

our financial performance on a us dollar denominated basis is subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates these fluctuations could cause material variations in our results of operations our principal exposures are to the australian dollar brazilian real british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese renminbi euro japanese yen mexican peso and swiss franc from time to time we enter into agreements that are intended to reduce the effects of our exposure to currency fluctuations but these agreements may not be effective in significantly reducing our exposure 

  

a strengthening in the us dollar relative to other currencies in the countries in which we operate such as has generally occurred during the covid19 pandemic todate would negatively affect our reported results of operations and financial results due to currency translation losses and currency transaction losses 

  

new regulations or regulatorybased claims could adversely affect our business 

  

our facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the united states department of agriculture the federal food and drug administration the occupational safety and health administration and other federal state local and foreign governmental agencies relating to the production packaging labelling storage distribution quality and safety of food products and the health and safety of our employees our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits administrative penalties and civil remedies including fines injunctions and recalls of our products we advertise our products and could be the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal state and foreign laws and regulations we may also be subject to new laws or regulations restricting our right to advertise our products including restrictions on the audience to whom products are marketed changes in laws or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements on us could increase our cost of doing business or restrict our actions causing our results of operations to be adversely affected 

  

significant covid19 related changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture sell or distribute our products including quarantines importexport restrictions price controls governmental or regulatory actions closures or other restrictions that limit or close our operating and manufacturing facilities restrict our employees’ ability to travel or perform necessary business functions or otherwise prevent our thirdparty partners suppliers or customers from sufficiently staffing operations including operations necessary for the production distribution sale and support of our products could adversely impact our operations and results  

  

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations our failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits administrative penalties and civil remedies we are currently party to a variety of environmental remediation obligations due to regulatory complexities uncertainties inherent in litigation and the risk of unidentified contaminants on current and former properties of ours the potential exists for remediation liability indemnification and compliance costs to differ from our estimates we cannot guarantee that our costs in relation to these matters or compliance with environmental laws in general will not exceed our established liabilities or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

  

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could limit financing and other options and in some cases adversely affect our ability to pay dividends 

  

as of may 31 2020 we had total debt redeemable interests and noncontrolling interests of 144 billion the agreements under which we have issued indebtedness do not prevent us from incurring additional unsecured indebtedness in the future our level of indebtedness may limit our 

  

 ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures or general corporate purposes particularly if the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward and 

 flexibility to adjust to changing business and market conditions and may make us more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions 

  

there are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments and noncontrolling interests if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the related indebtedness and other unrelated indebtedness could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity and our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing may also be adversely affected 

  

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt and other obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control 

  

  

global capital and credit market issues could negatively affect our liquidity increase our costs of borrowing and disrupt the operations of our suppliers and customers 

  

we depend on stable liquid and wellfunctioning capital and credit markets to fund our operations although we believe that our operating cash flows financial assets access to capital and credit markets and revolving credit agreements will permit us to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future there can be no assurance that future volatility or disruption in the capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing we also utilize interest rate derivatives to reduce the volatility of our financing costs if we are not effective in hedging this volatility we may experience an increase in our costs of borrowing our business could also be negatively impacted if our suppliers or customers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy 

  

the covid19 pandemic has increased volatility and pricing in the capital markets we may not have access to preferred sources of liquidity when needed or on terms we find acceptable and our borrowing costs could increase an economic or credit crisis could occur and impair credit availability and our ability to raise capital when needed a disruption in the financial markets may have a negative effect on our derivative counterparties and could impair our banking or other business partners on whom we rely for access to capital and as counterparties to our derivative contracts 

  

from time to time we issue variable rate securities based on interbank offered rates ibors and enter into interest rate swaps that contain a variable element based on an ibor there is currently uncertainty whether certain ibors will continue to be available after 2021 if certain ibors cease to be available we may need to amend affected agreements and we cannot predict what alternative index would be negotiated with our counterparties and security holders as a result our interest expense could increase and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected 

  

volatility in the securities markets interest rates and other factors could substantially increase our defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit costs 

  

we sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the united states canada and various foreign locations including defined benefit pension retiree health and welfare severance and other postemployment plans our major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments changes in interest rates mortality rates health care costs early retirement rates investment returns and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plans a significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations 

  

our business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or are breached 

  

information technology serves an important role in the efficient and effective operation of our business we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information to manage a variety of business processes and to comply with regulatory legal and tax requirements our information technology systems and infrastructure are critical to effectively manage our key business processes including digital marketing order entry and fulfillment supply chain management finance administration and other business processes these technologies enable internal and external communication among our locations employees suppliers customers and others and include the receipt and storage of personal information about our employees consumers and proprietary business information our information technology systems some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties may be vulnerable to damage interruption or shutdown due to any number of causes such as catastrophic events natural disasters fires power outages systems failures telecommunications failures security breaches computer viruses hackers employee error or malfeasance and other causes increased cybersecurity threats pose a potential risk to the security and viability of our information technology systems as well as the confidentiality integrity and availability of the data stored on those systems the failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and result in transaction errors processing inefficiencies data loss legal claims or proceedings regulatory penalties and the loss of sales and customers any interruption of our information technology systems could have operational reputational legal and financial impacts that may have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

  

a change in the assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses or a different weightedaverage cost of capital used to value our reporting units or our indefinitelived intangible assets could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth 

  

as of may 31 2020 we had 205 billion of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets goodwill for each of our reporting units is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred we compare the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill to the fair value of the reporting unit if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill impairment has occurred our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our longrange planning process we also make estimates of discount rates perpetuity growth assumptions market comparables and other factors if current expectations for growth rates for sales and profits are not met or other market factors and macroeconomic conditions that could be affected by the covid19 pandemic or otherwise were to change then our reporting units could become significantly impaired our europe  australia reporting unit had experienced declining business performance and we continue to monitor this business while we currently believe that our goodwill is not impaired different assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses could result in significant impairment losses 

  

we evaluate the useful lives of our intangible assets primarily intangible assets associated with the blue buffalo  pillsbury  totino’s  progresso  yoplait  old el paso  yoki  häagendazs  and annie’s brands to determine if they are finite or indefinitelived reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry known technological advances legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 

  

our indefinitelived intangible assets are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred our estimate of the fair value of the brands is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs including projected revenues from our longrange plan assumed royalty rates which could be payable if we did not own the brands and a discount rate if current expectations for growth rates for sales and margins are not met or other market factors and macroeconomic conditions that could be affected by the covid19 pandemic or otherwise were to change then our indefinitelived intangible assets could become significantly impaired our pillsbury and progresso brands had experienced declining business performance and we continue to monitor these businesses 

  

for further information on goodwill and intangible assets please refer to note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

  

our failure to successfully integrate acquisitions into our existing operations could adversely affect our financial results 

  

from time to time we evaluate potential acquisitions or joint ventures that would further our strategic objectives our success depends in part upon our ability to integrate acquired and existing operations if we are unable to successfully integrate acquisitions our financial results could suffer additional potential risks associated with acquisitions include additional debt leverage the loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business the assumption of unknown liabilities the inherent risk associated with entering a geographic area or line of business in which we have no or limited prior experience failure to achieve anticipated synergies and the impairment of goodwill or other acquisitionrelated intangible assets

 item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

executive overview 

  

we are a global packaged foods company we develop distinctive valueadded food products and market them under unique brand names we work continuously to improve our core products and to create new products that meet consumers’ evolving needs and preferences in addition we build the equity of our brands over time with strong consumerdirected marketing innovative new products and effective merchandising we believe our brandbuilding strategy is the key to winning and sustaining leading share positions in markets around the globe 

  

our fundamental financial goal is to generate superior returns for our shareholders over the long term we believe achieving that goal requires us to generate a consistent balance of net sales growth margin expansion cash conversion and cash return to shareholders over time 

  

fiscal 2020 was a year of significant challenge and change in the external environment and we adapted and executed to deliver strong financial results while remaining focused on the health and safety of our employees and our company purpose of making food the world loves prior to the outbreak of the covid19 pandemic we expected to meet or exceed each of our key fiscal 2020 financial targets the virus outbreak had a profound impact on consumer demand across our major markets including driving an unprecedented increase in demand for food at home and a corresponding decrease in demand for awayfromhome food resulting from efforts to reduce virus transmission after the onset of the pandemic elevated athome food demand accelerated net sales growth in the fourth quarter in the north america retail segment where a significant share of net sales comes from categories that were most impacted by athome eating including meals baking and cereal the impact of elevated athome demand was less pronounced in the europe  australia segment reflecting its lower proportion of net sales in those categories the pet segment experienced increased demand early in the fourth quarter from stockup purchasing which partially unwound by the end of the quarter lower awayfromhome food demand reduced growth for the convenience stores  foodservice and asia  latin america segments consequently our fullyear results significantly exceeded our initial annual targets for organic net sales growth constantcurrency growth in adjusted operating profit and adjusted diluted earnings per share eps and free cash flow conversion 

we delivered on the three key priorities we outlined at the beginning of fiscal 2020 

first we accelerated our organic net sales growth rate compared to our fiscal 2019 performance driven by strong execution to meet elevated demand during the covid19 pandemic healthy levels of innovation and a significant increase in capabilities and brandbuilding investment we experienced robust growth in organic net sales in north america retail aided by our ability to meet the pandemicrelated increase in demand for meals and baking categories during the fourth quarter as well as consistently strong results in us cereal and important improvements in us snack bars and us yogurt throughout the year we exceeded our organic net sales growth goal for our pet segment driven by a successful expansion of blue into additional customer outlets and a significant increase in household penetration for the brand organic net sales results in our convenience stores  foodservice europe  australia and asia  latin america segments were below fiscal 2019 levels due to a slow start to the year in each of those segments as well as the pandemicrelated headwinds impacting convenience stores  foodservice and asia  latin america in the second half of the year 

second we maintained our strong adjusted operating profit margins  the combination of our continued strong levels of holistic margin management hmm savings volume growth and positive net price realization and mix offset input cost inflation and increased investments in brand building and capabilities resulting in significant growth in constantcurrency adjusted operating profit and adjusted diluted eps 

third we reduced our leverage  our continued cash discipline delivered a significant reduction in core working capital and strong free cash flow conversion resulting in reduced debt and an important decrease in our leverage ratio 

our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2020 rose 5 percent to 176 billion on an organic basis net sales increased 4 percent compared to yearago levels operating profit of 30 billion increased 17 percent adjusted operating profit of 30 billion increased 7 percent on a constantcurrency basis diluted eps of 356 was up 23 percent compared to fiscal 2019 results adjusted diluted eps of 361 increased 12 percent on a constantcurrency basis see the “nongaap measures” section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap 

  

net cash provided by operations totaled 37 billion in fiscal 2020 representing a conversion rate of 166 percent of net earnings including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests this cash generation supported capital investments totaling 461 million and our resulting free cash flow was 32 billion at a conversion rate of 143 percent of adjusted net earnings including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests we also returned cash to shareholders through dividends totaling 12 billion and reduced total debt outstanding by 10 billion our ratio of net debttooperating cash flow was 32 in fiscal 2020 and our 

  

net debttoadjusted earnings before net interest income taxes depreciation and amortization net debttoadjusted ebitda ratio was 32 which was favorable to our fiscal 2020 target of 35 see the “nongaap measures” section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by gaap 

  

a detailed review of our fiscal 2020 performance compared to fiscal 2019 appears below in the section titled “fiscal 2020 consolidated results of operations” a detailed review of our fiscal 2019 performance compared to our fiscal 2018 performance is set forth in part ii item 7 of our form 10k for the fiscal year ended may 26 2019 under the caption “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – fiscal 2019 results of consolidated operations” which is incorporated herein by reference 

  

we have outlined three key priorities for fiscal 2021 that we expect will allow us to generate competitive performance while continuing to advance our longterm goals 

  

1 compete effectively everywhere we play  leading to increased brand penetration competitive service levels strengthened customer partnerships and market share gains in our key categories we expect net sales growth in fiscal 2021 will be positively impacted by superior execution as well as elevated athome food demand relative to the prepandemic period we anticipate headwinds to fiscal 2021 net sales growth from comparisons against the 53rd week the extra month of pet segment results and the pandemicrelated increase in demand in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 additionally fiscal 2021 net sales growth may be negatively impacted by a potential reduction in consumers’ athome food inventory which has been elevated during the pandemic 

2 drive efficiency to fuel investment  we anticipate that the combination of benefits from our hmm initiatives and volume leverage and headwinds from input cost inflation increased investment in our brands and capabilities higher costs to service elevated demand and higher ongoing health and safetyrelated expenses will result in an adjusted operating profit margin that is approximately in line with fiscal 2020 levels 

3 reduce leverage to increase financial flexibility  we expect to make further progress in fiscal 2021 in reducing our net debttoadjusted ebitda ratio 

  

we expect the largest factor impacting our fiscal 2021 performance will be relative balance of athome versus awayfromhome consumer food demand this balance will be determined by factors such as consumers’ ability and willingness to eat in restaurants the proportion of people working from home the reopening of schools and changes in consumers’ income levels while the covid19 pandemic has significantly influenced each of these factors in recent months the magnitude and duration of its future impact remains highly uncertain 

  

we expect consumer concerns about covid19 virus transmission and the recession to drive elevated demand for food at home relative to prepandemic levels we are tracking the level of virus control the possibility of a secondwave outbreak the availability of a vaccine gdp growth unemployment rates consumer confidence and wage growth among other factors to assess the likely magnitude and duration of elevated athome food demand

to ensure availability of funds we maintain bank credit lines and have commercial paper programs available to us in the united states and europe in response to uncertainty surrounding the availability and cost of commercial paper borrowings as a result of the covid19 pandemic we issued 750 million of fixedrate notes in april 2020 and reduced our borrowings under commercial paper programs as the covid19 pandemic evolves we will continue to evaluate its impact to our sources of liquidity we also have uncommitted and assetbacked credit lines that support our foreign operations

the thirdparty holder of the general mills cereals llc gmc class a interests receives quarterly preferred distributions from available net income based on the application of a floating preferred return rate to the holder’s capital account balance established in the most recent marktomarket valuation currently 252 million on june 1 2018 the floating preferred return rate on gmc’s class a interests was reset to the sum of threemonth libor plus 1425 basis points the preferred return rate is adjusted every three years through a negotiated agreement with the class a interest holder or through a remarketing auction 

  

we have an option to purchase the class a interests for consideration equal to the then current capital account value plus any unpaid preferred return and the prescribed makewhole amount if we purchase these interests any change in the thirdparty holder’s capital account from its original value will be charged directly to retained earnings and will increase or decrease the net earnings used to calculate eps in that period 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

  

as of may 31 2020 we have issued guarantees and comfort letters of 130 million for the debt and other obligations of nonconsolidated affiliates mainly cpw in addition offbalance sheet arrangements were not material as of may 31 2020 

  

as of may 31 2020 we invested in three variable interest entities vies none of our vies are material to our results of operations financial condition or liquidity as of and for the fiscal year ended may 31 2020 

  

our defined benefit plans in the united states are subject to the requirements of the pension protection act ppa in the future the ppa may require us to make additional contributions to our domestic plans we do not expect to be required to make any contributions in fiscal 2021 

  

the following table summarizes our future estimated cash payments under existing contractual obligations including payments due by period 

  

 a amounts represent the expected cash payments of our longterm debt and do not include 02 million for finance leases or 584 million for net unamortized debt issuance costs premiums and discounts and fair value adjustments 

b see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information on our lease arrangements 

c the majority of the purchase obligations represent commitments for raw material and packaging to be utilized in the normal course of business and for consumer marketing spending commitments that support our brands for purposes of this table arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice usually 30 days any amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheets as accounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the table above 

d the fair value of our foreign exchange equity commodity and grain derivative contracts with a payable position to the counterparty was 431 million as of may 31 2020 based on fair market values as of that date future changes in market values will impact the amount of cash ultimately paid or received to settle those instruments in the future other longterm obligations mainly consist of liabilities for accrued compensation and benefits including the underfunded status of certain of our defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plans and miscellaneous liabilities we expect to pay approximately 24 million of benefits from our unfunded postemployment benefit plans and approximately 21 million of deferred compensation in fiscal 2021 we are unable to reliably estimate the amount of these payments beyond fiscal 2021 as of may 31 2020 our total liability for uncertain tax positions and accrued interest and penalties was 1758 million 

  

  

significant accounting estimates 

  

for a complete description of our significant accounting policies please see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report our significant accounting estimates are those that have a meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations these estimates include our accounting for revenue recognition valuation of longlived assets intangible assets redeemable interest stockbased compensation income taxes and defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plans 

  

considerations related to the covid19 pandemic 

the impact that the recent covid19 pandemic will have on our consolidated results of operations is uncertain we saw increased orders from retail customers across all geographies in response to increased consumer demand for food at home we also experienced a covid19related decrease in consumer traffic in awayfromhome food outlets during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2020 nearterm elevated retail customer orders may unwind in the coming months and we are unable to predict the nature and timing of when that impact may occur if at all we have considered the potential impacts of the covid19 pandemic in our significant accounting estimates as of may 31 2020 and will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our business and consolidated results of operations 

  

revenue recognition 

our revenues are reported net of variable consideration and consideration payable to our customers including trade promotion consumer coupon redemption and other reductions to the transaction price including estimated allowances for returns unsalable product and prompt pay discounts trade promotions are recorded using significant judgment of estimated participation and performance levels for offered programs at the time of sale differences between the estimated and actual reduction to the transaction price is recognized as a change in estimate in a subsequent period our accrued trade and coupon promotion liabilities were 471 million as of may 31 2020 and 410 million as of may 26 2019 because these amounts are significant if our estimates are inaccurate we would have to make adjustments in subsequent periods that could have a significant effect on our results of operations 

  

valuation of longlived assets 

we estimate the useful lives of longlived assets and make estimates concerning undiscounted cash flows to review for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent appraisals as appropriate 

  

intangible assets 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are not subject to amortization and are tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred our estimates of fair value for goodwill impairment testing are determined based on a discounted cash flow model we use inputs from our longrange planning process to determine growth rates for sales and profits we also make estimates of discount rates perpetuity growth assumptions market comparables and other factors 

  

we evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets mainly brands to determine if they are finite or indefinitelived reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry known technological advances legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets intangible assets that are deemed to have finite lives are amortized on a straightline basis over their useful lives generally ranging from 4 to 30 years our estimate of the fair value of our brand assets is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs which include projected revenues from our longrange plan assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands and a discount rate 

  

as of may 31 2020 we had 20 billion of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets we assessed our goodwill and brand intangible assets for potential impairment indicators using quantitative and qualitative factors including the estimated impacts of the covid19 pandemic as of may 31 2020 and concluded that no impairment indicators were present as of that date while we currently believe that the fair value of each intangible exceeds its carrying value and that those intangibles will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses or a different weightedaverage cost of capital could result in material impairment losses and amortization expense we performed our fiscal 2020 assessment of our intangible assets as of the first day of the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and we determined there was no impairment of our intangible assets as their related fair values were substantially in excess of the carrying values except for the europe  australia reporting unit and the progresso brand intangible asset 

  

  

the excess fair value as of the fiscal 2020 test date of the europe  australia reporting unit and the progresso brand intangible asset were as follows 

  

   

in addition while having significant coverage as of our fiscal 2020 assessment date the pillsbury brand intangible asset had risk of decreasing coverage we will continue to monitor our businesses for potential impairment 

  

redeemable interest 

the significant assumptions used to estimate the redemption value of the redeemable interest include projected revenue growth and profitability from our longrange plan capital spending depreciation and taxes foreign currency exchange rates and a discount rate as of may 31 2020 the redemption value of the redeemable interest was 545 million 

  

stockbased compensation 

the valuation of stock options is a significant accounting estimate that requires us to use judgments and assumptions that are likely to have a material impact on our financial statements annually we make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility employee exercise behavior dividend yield and the forfeiture rate for more information on these assumptions please see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

  

the estimated fair values of stock options granted and the assumptions used for the blackscholes optionpricing model were as follows 

  

  

   

the riskfree interest rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based on the us treasury zerocoupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant an increase in the expected term by 1 year leaving all other assumptions constant would increase the grant date fair value by 1 percent if all other assumptions are held constant a one percentage point increase in our fiscal 2020 volatility assumption would increase the grant date fair value of our fiscal 2020 option awards by 7 percent 

  

to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our assumptions we are not required to true up grantdate fair valuebased expense to final intrinsic values historical data has a significant bearing on our forwardlooking assumptions significant variances between actual and predicted experience could lead to prospective revisions in our assumptions which could then significantly impact the yearoveryear comparability of stockbased compensation expense 

  

any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings referred to as a windfall tax benefit is presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows as an operating cash flow the actual impact on future years’ cash flows will depend in part on the volume of employee stock option exercises during a particular year and the relationship between the exercisedate market value of the underlying stock and the original grantdate fair value previously determined for financial reporting purposes 

  

realized windfall tax benefits and shortfall tax deficiencies related to the exercise or vesting of stockbased awards are recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings because employee stock option exercise behavior is not within our control it is possible that significantly different reported results could occur if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail 

  

income taxes 

we apply a morelikelythannot threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions accordingly we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement future changes in 

  

judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect earnings in the quarter of such change for more information on income taxes please see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

  

defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plans 

we have defined benefit pension plans covering many employees in the united states canada switzerland france and the united kingdom we also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to many of our retirees in the united states canada and brazil under certain circumstances we also provide accruable benefits primarily severance to former and inactive employees in the united states canada and mexico please see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for a description of our defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plans 

  

we recognize benefits provided during retirement or following employment over the plan participants’ active working lives accordingly we make various assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement of our obligations assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our net periodic benefit expense or income and accumulated benefit obligations include the longterm rates of return on plan assets the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our benefit plans and health care cost trend rates 

  

expected rate of return on plan assets 

  

our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation our historical longterm investment performance our estimate of future longterm returns by asset class using input from our actuaries investment services and investment managers and longterm inflation assumptions we review this assumption annually for each plan however our annual investment performance for one particular year does not by itself significantly influence our evaluation 

  

our historical investment returns compound annual growth rates for our united states defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets were 154 percent 85 percent 101 percent 82 percent and 79 percent for the 1 5 10 15 and 20 year periods ended may 31 2020 

  

on a weightedaverage basis the expected rate of return for all defined benefit plans was 695 percent for fiscal 2020 725 percent for fiscal 2019 and 788 percent for fiscal 2018 for fiscal 2021 we lowered our weightedaverage expected rate of return on plan assets for our principal defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in the united states to 567 percent due to asset allocation changes and expected asset returns 

  

lowering the expected longterm rate of return on assets by 100 basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense by 79 million for fiscal 2021 a marketrelated valuation basis is used to reduce yeartoyear expense volatility the marketrelated valuation recognizes certain investment gains or losses over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the marketrelated value of assets and the actual return based on the marketrelated value of assets our outside actuaries perform these calculations as part of our determination of annual expense or income 

  

discount rates 

  

we estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic benefit expense for our united states and most of our international defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plans utilizing a full yield curve approach by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of may 31 for our defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plan obligations we work with our outside actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan participants and using the aa above median corporate bond yield to develop a forward interest rate curve including a margin to that index based on our credit risk this forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions 

  

  

our weightedaverage discount rates were as follows 

  

   

lowering the discount rates by 100 basis points would increase our net defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plan expense for fiscal 2021 by approximately 54 million all obligationrelated experience gains and losses are amortized using a straightline method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants or over the average remaining lifetime of the remaining plan participants if the plan is viewed as “all or almost all” inactive participants 

  

health care cost trend rates 

  

we review our health care cost trend rates annually our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims experience and information provided by our actuaries this information includes recent plan experience plan design overall industry experience and projections and assumptions used by other similar organizations our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with this review recent experiences and shortterm expectations our initial health care cost trend rate assumption is 65 percent for retirees age 65 and over and 62 percent for retirees under age 65 at the end of fiscal 2020 rates are graded down annually until the ultimate trend rate of 45 percent is reached in 2029 for all retirees the trend rates are applicable for calculations only if the retirees’ benefits increase as a result of health care inflation the ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually as necessary to approximate the current economic view on the rate of longterm inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium assumed trend rates for health care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans 

  

any arising health care claims costrelated experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculation of expected future claims once recognized experience gains and losses are amortized using a straightline method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants or over the average remaining lifetime of the remaining plan participants if the plan is viewed as “all or almost all” inactive participants 

  

financial statement impact 

  

in fiscal 2020 we recorded net defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plan income of 2 million compared to 24 million of expense in fiscal 2019 and 23 million of expense in fiscal 2018 as of may 31 2020 we had cumulative unrecognized actuarial net losses of 2 billion on our defined benefit pension plans and cumulative unrecognized actuarial net gains of 114 million on our postretirement and postemployment benefit plans mainly as the result of liability increases from lower interest rates partially offset by recent increases in the values of plan assets these unrecognized actuarial net losses will result in increases in our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses because they currently exceed the corridors defined by gaap 

  

actual future net defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plan income or expense will depend on investment performance changes in future discount rates changes in health care cost trend rates and other factors related to the populations participating in these plans 

  

  

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

  

in march 2020 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued optional accounting guidance for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform the new standard provides expedients and exceptions to existing accounting requirements for contract modifications and hedge accounting related to transitioning from discontinued reference rates such as libor to alternative reference rates if certain criteria are met the new accounting requirements can be applied as of the beginning of the interim period including march 12 2020 or any date thereafter through december 31 2022 we are in the process of reviewing our contracts and arrangements that will be affected by a discontinued reference rate and analyzing the impact of this guidance on our results of operations and financial position 

  

in december 2019 the fasb issued new accounting requirements related to income taxes the new standard simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences and the methodology for calculating income taxes in interim periods the new standard also simplifies aspects of accounting for franchise taxes and enacted changes in tax laws or rates and clarifies accounting for transactions that result in a stepup in the tax basis of goodwill the requirements of the new standard are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2020 and interim periods within those annual periods which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2022 early adoption is permitted we do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 

  

in june 2016 the fasb issued new accounting requirements related to the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments including trade receivables the new accounting requirements replace the incurred loss impairment model with a forwardlooking expected credit loss model which will generally result in earlier recognition of credit losses the requirements of the new standard and subsequent amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2019 and interim periods within those annual periods which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2021 we will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 using a modified retrospective transition approach we expect to record an immaterial cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date to align our calculation of credit losses to the new model with consideration of the economic implications of the covid19 pandemic we do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position

 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

we are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates and commodity and equity prices changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows in the normal course of business we actively manage our exposure to these market risks by entering into various hedging transactions authorized under established policies that place clear controls on these activities the counterparties in these transactions are generally highly rated institutions we establish credit limits for each counterparty our hedging transactions include but are not limited to a variety of derivative financial instruments for information on interest rate foreign exchange commodity price and equity instrument risk please see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

  

value at risk 

  

the estimates in the table below are intended to measure the maximum potential fair value we could lose in one day from adverse changes in market interest rates foreign exchange rates commodity prices and equity prices under normal market conditions a monte carlo valueatrisk var methodology was used to quantify the market risk for our exposures the models assumed normal market conditions and used a 95 percent confidence level 

  

the var calculation used historical interest and foreign exchange rates and commodity and equity prices from the past year to estimate the potential volatility and correlation of these rates in the future the market data were drawn from the riskmetrics ™ data set the calculations are not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that we expect to incur further since the hedging instrument the derivative inversely correlates with the underlying exposure we would expect that any loss or gain in the fair value of our derivatives would be generally offset by an increase or decrease in the fair value of the underlying exposure the positions included in the calculations were debt investments interest rate swaps foreign exchange forwards commodity swaps futures and options and equity instruments the calculations do not include the underlying foreign exchange and commodities or equityrelated positions that are offset by these marketrisksensitive instruments 

  

  

the table below presents the estimated maximum potential var arising from a oneday loss in fair value for our interest rate foreign currency commodity and equity marketrisksensitive instruments outstanding as of may 31 2020 and may 26 2019 and the average fair value impact during the year ended may 31 2020

competition the packaged foods categories are highly competitive with numerous manufacturers of varying sizes in the united states and throughout the world the categories in which we participate also are very competitive our principal competitors in these categories are manufacturers as well as retailers with their own branded products competitors market and sell their products through brickandmortar stores and ecommerce all of our principal competitors have substantial financial marketing and other resources competition in our product categories is based on product innovation product quality price brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing promotional activity convenient ordering and delivery to the consumer and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences our principal strategies for competing in each of our segments include unique consumer insights effective customer relationships superior product quality innovative advertising product promotion product innovation aligned with consumers’ needs an efficient supply chain and price in most product categories we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products but also with regional brands and with generic and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices internationally we compete with both multinational and local manufacturers and each country includes a unique group of competitors 

raw materials ingredients and packaging the principal raw materials that we use are grains wheat oats and corn dairy products sugar fruits vegetable oils meats nuts vegetables and other agricultural products we also use substantial quantities of carton board corrugated plastic and metal packaging materials operating supplies and energy most of these inputs for our domestic and canadian operations are purchased from suppliers in the united states in our other international operations inputs that are not locally available in adequate supply may be imported from other countries the cost of these inputs may fluctuate widely due to external conditions such as weather product scarcity limited sources of supply commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations trade tariffs and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations we have some longterm fixed price contracts but the majority of our inputs are purchased on the open market we believe that we will be able to obtain an adequate supply of needed inputs occasionally and where possible we make advance purchases of items significant to our business in order to ensure continuity of operations our objective is to procure materials meeting both our quality standards and our production needs at price levels that allow a targeted profit margin since these inputs generally represent the largest variable cost in manufacturing our products to the extent possible we often manage the risk associated with adverse price movements for some inputs using a variety of risk management strategies we also have a grain merchandising operation that provides 

 

us efficient access to and more informed knowledge of various commodity markets principally wheat and oats this operation holds physical inventories that are carried at net realizable value and uses derivatives to manage its net inventory position and minimize its market exposures

 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties any of the risks described below could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the categories in which we participate are very competitive and if we are not able to compete effectively our results of operations could be adversely affected 

the consumer and pet food categories in which we participate are very competitive our principal competitors in these categories are manufacturers as well as retailers with their own branded and private label products competitors market and sell their products through brickandmortar stores and ecommerce all of our principal competitors have substantial financial marketing and other resources in most product categories we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products but also with regional brands and with generic and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices competition in our product categories is based on 

 

product innovation product quality price brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing promotional activity convenient ordering and delivery to the consumer and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences if our large competitors were to seek an advantage through pricing or promotional changes we could choose to do the same which could adversely affect our margins and profitability if we did not do the same our revenues and market share could be adversely affected our market share and revenue growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing innovative products in response to changing consumer demands or by new product introductions of our competitors if we are unable to build and sustain brand equity by offering recognizably superior product quality we may be unable to maintain premium pricing over generic and private label products 

we may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face of a consolidating retail environment 

there has been significant consolidation in the grocery industry resulting in customers with increased purchasing power in addition large retail customers may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency lower pricing increased reliance on their own brand name products increased emphasis on generic and other economy brands and increased promotional programs if we are unable to use our scale marketing expertise product innovation knowledge of consumers’ needs and category leadership positions to respond to these demands our profitability and volume growth could be negatively impacted in addition the loss of any large customer could adversely affect our sales and profits in fiscal 2019 walmart accounted for 20 percent of our consolidated net sales and 31 percent of net sales of our north america retail segment petsmart and petco accounted for 36 percent and 14 percent respectively of our pet segment’s net sales in fiscal 2019 national pet superstore chains have experienced reduced store traffic if national pet superstore chains continue to experience reduced store traffic or experience any operational difficulties our pet segment operating results may be adversely affected for more information on significant customers please see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

price changes for the commodities we depend on for raw materials packaging and energy may adversely affect our profitability 

the principal raw materials that we use are commodities that experience price volatility caused by external conditions such as weather product scarcity limited sources of supply commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations trade tariffs and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations commodity price changes may result in unexpected increases in raw material packaging and energy costs if we are unable to increase productivity to offset these increased costs or increase our prices we may experience reduced margins and profitability we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and the risk management procedures that we do use may not always work as we intend 

volatility in the market value of derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices will cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings 

we utilize derivatives to manage price risk for some of our principal ingredient and energy costs including grains oats wheat and corn oils principally soybean dairy products natural gas and diesel fuel changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded in earnings currently resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings these gains and losses are reported in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of earnings and in unallocated corporate items outside our segment operating results until we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating profit we also record our grain inventories at net realizable value we may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments 

if we are not efficient in our production our profitability could suffer as a result of the highly competitive environment in which we operate 

our future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to be efficient in the production and manufacture of our products in highly competitive markets gaining additional efficiencies may become more 

 

difficult over time our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or by eliminating redundant costs resulting from acquisitions or divestitures could adversely affect our profitability and weaken our competitive position many productivity initiatives involve complex reorganization of manufacturing facilities and production lines such manufacturing realignment may result in the interruption of production which may negatively impact product volume and margins we periodically engage in restructuring and cost savings initiatives designed to increase our efficiency and reduce expenses if we are unable to execute those initiatives as planned we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

disruption of our supply chain could adversely affect our business 

our ability to make move and sell products is critical to our success damage or disruption to raw material supplies or our manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather including any potential effects of climate change natural disaster fire terrorism cyberattack pandemic strikes importexport restrictions or other factors could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products many of our product lines are manufactured at a single location our suppliers’ policies and practices can damage our reputation and the quality and safety of our products failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or to effectively manage such events if they occur particularly when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location could adversely affect our business and results of operations as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain 

concerns with the safety and quality of food products could cause consumers to avoid certain food products or ingredients 

we could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients adverse publicity about these types of concerns whether or not valid may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions 

if our products become adulterated misbranded or mislabeled we might need to recall those items and may experience product liability claims if consumers or their pets are injured 

we may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated misbranded or mislabeled a widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time we could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us a significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity damage to our reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in our products which could have an adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands 

we may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and trends which may result in decreased demand for our products 

our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes eating habits and purchasing behaviors of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences in channels where they shop consumer preferences and categorylevel consumption may change from time to time and can be affected by a number of different trends and other factors if we fail to anticipate identify or react to these changes and trends such as adapting to emerging ecommerce channels or to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis we may experience reduced demand for our products which would in turn cause our revenues and profitability to suffer similarly demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns regarding the health effects of ingredients such as sodium trans fats genetically modified organisms sugar processed wheat or other product ingredients or attributes 

 

we may be unable to grow our market share or add products that are in faster growing and more profitable categories 

the food industry’s growth potential is constrained by population growth our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business faster than populations are growing in the markets that we serve one way to achieve that growth is to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new products in faster growing and more profitable categories our future results will also depend on our ability to increase market share in our existing product categories if we do not succeed in developing innovative products for new and existing categories our growth and profitability could be adversely affected 

economic downturns could limit consumer demand for our products 

the willingness of consumers to purchase our products depends in part on local economic conditions in periods of economic uncertainty consumers may purchase more generic private label and other economy brands and may forego certain purchases altogether in those circumstances we could experience a reduction in sales of higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings in addition as a result of economic conditions or competitive actions we may be unable to raise our prices sufficiently to protect margins consumers may also reduce the amount of food that they consume away from home at customers that purchase products from our convenience stores  foodservice segment any of these events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

our results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands 

maintaining and continually enhancing the value of our many iconic brands is critical to the success of our business the value of our brands is based in large part on the degree to which consumers react and respond positively to these brands brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner adverse publicity about our products our failure to maintain the quality of our products the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences concerns about food safety or our products becoming unavailable to consumers consumer demand for our products may also be impacted by changes in the level of advertising or promotional support the use of social and digital media by consumers us and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared negative posts or comments about us our brands or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation if we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands our business results could be negatively impacted 

our international operations are subject to political and economic risks 

in fiscal 2019 26 percent of our consolidated net sales were generated outside of the united states we are accordingly subject to a number of risks relating to doing business internationally any of which could significantly harm our business these risks include 

 

         

our financial performance on a us dollar denominated basis is subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates these fluctuations could cause material variations in our results of operations our principal exposures are to the australian dollar brazilian real british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese renminbi euro japanese yen mexican peso and swiss franc from time to time we enter into agreements that are intended to reduce the effects of our exposure to currency fluctuations but these agreements may not be effective in significantly reducing our exposure 

new regulations or regulatorybased claims could adversely affect our business 

our facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the united states department of agriculture the federal food and drug administration the occupational safety and health administration and other federal state local and foreign governmental agencies relating to the production packaging labelling storage distribution quality and safety of food products and the health and safety of our employees our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits administrative penalties and civil remedies including fines injunctions and recalls of our products we advertise our products and could be the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal state and foreign laws and regulations we may also be subject to new laws or regulations restricting our right to advertise our products including restrictions on the audience to whom products are marketed changes in laws or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements on us could increase our cost of doing business or restrict our actions causing our results of operations to be adversely affected 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations our failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits administrative penalties and civil remedies we are currently party to a variety of environmental remediation obligations due to regulatory complexities uncertainties inherent in litigation and the risk of unidentified contaminants on current and former properties of ours the potential exists for remediation liability indemnification and compliance costs to differ from our estimates we cannot guarantee that our costs in relation to these matters or compliance with environmental laws in general will not exceed our established liabilities or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could limit financing and other options and in some cases adversely affect our ability to pay dividends 

as of may 26 2019 we had total debt redeemable interests and noncontrolling interests of 154 billion the agreements under which we have issued indebtedness do not prevent us from incurring additional unsecured indebtedness in the future our level of indebtedness may limit our 

 

  there are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments and noncontrolling interests if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the related indebtedness and other unrelated indebtedness could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity and our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing may also be adversely affected 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt and other obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control 

 

global capital and credit market issues could negatively affect our liquidity increase our costs of borrowing and disrupt the operations of our suppliers and customers 

we depend on stable liquid and wellfunctioning capital and credit markets to fund our operations although we believe that our operating cash flows financial assets access to capital and credit markets and revolving credit agreements will permit us to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future there can be no assurance that future volatility or disruption in the capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing we also utilize interest rate derivatives to reduce the volatility of our financing costs if we are not effective in hedging this volatility we may experience an increase in our costs of borrowing our business could also be negatively impacted if our suppliers or customers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy 

from time to time we issue variable rate securities based on interbank offered rates ibors and enter into interest rate swaps that contain a variable element based on an ibor there is currently uncertainty whether certain ibors will continue to be available after 2021 if certain ibors cease to be available we may need to amend affected agreements and we cannot predict what alternative index would be negotiated with our counterparties and security holders as a result our interest expense could increase and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected 

volatility in the securities markets interest rates and other factors could substantially increase our defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit costs 

we sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the united states canada and various foreign locations including defined benefit pension retiree health and welfare severance and other postemployment plans our major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments changes in interest rates mortality rates health care costs early retirement rates investment returns and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plans a significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations 

our business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or are breached 

information technology serves an important role in the efficient and effective operation of our business we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information to manage a variety of business processes and to comply with regulatory legal and tax requirements our information technology systems and infrastructure are critical to effectively manage our key business processes including digital marketing order entry and fulfillment supply chain management finance administration and other business processes these technologies enable internal and external communication among our locations employees suppliers customers and others and include the receipt and storage of personal information about our employees consumers and proprietary business information our information technology systems some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties may be vulnerable to damage interruption or shutdown due to any number of causes such as catastrophic events natural disasters fires power outages systems failures telecommunications failures security breaches computer viruses hackers employee error or malfeasance and other causes increased cybersecurity threats pose a potential risk to the security and viability of our information technology systems as well as the confidentiality integrity and availability of the data stored on those systems the failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and result in transaction errors processing inefficiencies data loss legal claims or proceedings regulatory penalties and the loss of sales and customers any interruption of our information technology systems could have operational reputational legal and financial impacts that may have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

a change in the assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses or a different weightedaverage cost of capital used to value our reporting units or our indefinitelived intangible assets could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth 

as of may 26 2019 we had 206 billion of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets goodwill for each of our reporting units is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred we compare the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill to the fair value of the reporting unit if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill impairment has occurred our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our longrange planning process we also make estimates of discount rates perpetuity growth assumptions market comparables and other factors our latin america and us yogurt reporting units have experienced declining business performance and we continue to monitor these businesses while we currently believe that our goodwill is not impaired different assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses could result in significant impairment losses 

we evaluate the useful lives of our intangible assets primarily intangible assets associated with the blue buffalo  pillsbury  totino’s  progresso  yoplait  old el paso  yoki  häagendazs  and annie’s brands to determine if they are finite or indefinitelived reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry known technological advances legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 

our indefinitelived intangible assets are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable our estimate of the fair value of the brands is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs including projected revenues from our longrange plan assumed royalty rates which could be payable if we did not own the brands and a discount rate our pillsbury  yoki  and progresso brands have experienced declining business performance and we continue to monitor these businesses for further information on goodwill and intangible assets please refer to note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the blue buffalo acquisition or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected 

our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the blue buffalo acquisition will depend to a large extent on our ability to integrate blue buffalo which is a complex costly and timeconsuming process we had not operated in the pet food sector prior to the acquisition of blue buffalo and our lack of experience in this sector may hinder our ability to manage blue buffalo successfully following the acquisition 

the integration process may disrupt our business and if implemented ineffectively could restrict the realization of the full expected benefits the failure to meet the challenges involved in the integration process and to realize the anticipated benefits of the blue buffalo acquisition could cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in our operations and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition the integration of blue buffalo may result in material unanticipated problems expenses liabilities competitive responses and loss of customers and other business relationships additional integration challenges include 

 

   

        many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and result in us becoming subject to litigation in addition even if blue buffalo is integrated successfully the full anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized including the synergies cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that are anticipated these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all further additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration process all of these factors could cause reductions in our earnings per share and decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the acquisition as a result it cannot be assured that the blue buffalo acquisition will result in the realization of the full or any anticipated benefits 

blue buffalo may underperform relative to our expectations 

the business prospects and financial performance of blue buffalo are subject to certain risks and uncertainties we may not be able to maintain the growth rate levels of revenue earnings or operating efficiency that we and blue buffalo have achieved or might achieve separately our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations when we acquired blue buffalo in fiscal 2018 we recorded significant brand intangible and goodwill assets at fair value based on among other things our projections of blue buffalo’s financial performance our failure to meet or exceed our projections could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations including a material impairment to our intangible assets 

our failure to successfully integrate other acquisitions into our existing operations could adversely affect our financial results 

from time to time we evaluate potential acquisitions or joint ventures that would further our strategic objectives our success depends in part upon our ability to integrate acquired and existing operations if we are unable to successfully integrate acquisitions our financial results could suffer additional potential risks associated with acquisitions include additional debt leverage the loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business the assumption of unknown liabilities the inherent risk associated with entering a geographic area or line of business in which we have no or limited prior experience failure to achieve anticipated synergies and the impairment of goodwill or other acquisitionrelated intangible assets

a summary of our consolidated financial results for fiscal 2019 follows 

 

  consolidated net sales were as follows

components of organic net sales growth are shown in the following table 

 

  organic net sales in fiscal 2019 were flat compared to fiscal 2018 as favorable organic net price realization and mix was offset by declining contributions from organic volume growth 

cost of sales increased 804 million in fiscal 2019 to 11108 million the increase was driven by a 503 million increase due to higher volume and a 194 million increase attributable to product rate and mix including the impact of the blue buffalo acquisition in fiscal 2019 we recorded a 53 million charge related to the fair value adjustment of inventory acquired in the blue buffalo acquisition we recorded a 36 million net increase in cost of sales related to marktomarket valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories compared to a net decrease of 32 million in fiscal 2018 please see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report in fiscal 2019 we recorded 10 million of restructuring charges in cost of

unallocated corporate items 

unallocated corporate items include corporate overhead expenses variances to planned domestic employee benefits and incentives contributions to the general mills foundation asset and liability remeasurement impact of hyperinflationary economies restructuring initiative projectrelated costs and other items that are not part of our measurement of segment operating performance this includes gains and losses from the marktomarket valuation of certain commodity positions until passed back to our operating segments in accordance with our policy as discussed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

in fiscal 2019 unallocated corporate expense increased 134 million to 340 million compared to 206 million last year primarily driven by compensation and benefits expenses in fiscal 2019 we recorded a 36 million net increase in expense related to marktomarket valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories compared to a 32 million net decrease in expense in the prior year in addition we recorded 10 million of restructuring charges and 1 million of restructuring initiative projectrelated costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2019 compared to 14 million of restructuring charges and 11 million of restructuring initiative projectrelated costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2018 in fiscal 2019 we recorded a 16 million gain from a legal recovery related to our yoplait sas subsidiary and 23 million of gains related to certain investment valuation adjustments we also recorded 26 million of integration costs in fiscal 2019 related to our acquisition of blue buffalo compared to 34 million of transaction and integration costs in fiscal 2018 in addition we recorded a 3 million loss related to the impact of hyperinflationary accounting for our argentina subsidiary in fiscal 2019 

impact of inflation 

we experienced input cost inflation of 4 percent in fiscal 2019 and 4 percent in fiscal 2018 primarily on commodity inputs we expect input cost inflation of approximately 4 percent in fiscal 2020 we attempt to minimize the effects of inflation through hmm planning and operating practices our risk management practices are discussed in item 7a of this report 

 

liquidity 

the primary source of our liquidity is cash flow from operations over the most recent twoyear period our operations have generated 56 billion in cash a substantial portion of this operating cash flow has been returned to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends we also use cash from operations to fund our capital expenditures and acquisitions we typically use a combination of cash notes payable and longterm debt and occasionally issue shares of stock to finance significant acquisitions 

as of may 26 2019 we had 399 million of cash and cash equivalents held in foreign jurisdictions as a result of the tcja the historic undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries were taxed in the us via the onetime repatriation tax in fiscal 2018 we have reevaluated our assertion and have concluded that although earnings prior to fiscal 2018 will remain permanently reinvested we will no longer make a permanent reinvestment assertion beginning with our fiscal 2018 earnings as part of the accounting for the tcja we recorded local country withholding taxes related to certain entities from which we began repatriating undistributed earnings and will continue to record local country withholding taxes on all future earnings as a result of the transition tax we may repatriate our cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries without such funds being subject to further us income tax liability please see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for additional information 

cash flows from operations 

 

 during fiscal 2019 cash provided by operations was 2807 million compared to 2841 million in the same period last year the 34 million decrease was primarily driven by a 377 million decrease in net earnings and a 550 million change in current assets and liabilities partially offset by a 598 million change in deferred income taxes the 550 million change in current assets and liabilities was primarily driven by a 413 million change in the timing of accounts payable including the impact of longer payment terms implemented in prior fiscal years the change in deferred income taxes was primarily related to the 638 million provisional benefit from revaluing our net us deferred tax liabilities to reflect the new us corporate tax rate as a result of the tcja in fiscal 2018 

we strive to grow core working capital at or below the rate of growth in our net sales for fiscal 2019 core working capital decreased 34 percent compared to a net sales increase of 7 percent as of may 26 2019 our core working capital balance totaled 385 million down 34 percent versus last year this is primarily driven by continued benefits from our payment terms extension program and lower inventory balances in fiscal 2018 core working capital decreased 27 percent compared to a net sales increase of 1 percent 

 

cash flows from investing activities 

 

 in fiscal 2019 we used 556 million of cash through investing activities compared to 87 billion in fiscal 2018 this decrease was primarily driven by the acquisition of blue buffalo for an aggregate purchase price of 80 billion including 103 million of consideration for net debt repaid in fiscal 2018 we invested 538 million in land buildings and equipment in fiscal 2019 85 million less than fiscal 2018 

we expect capital expenditures to be approximately 35 percent of reported net sales in fiscal 2020 these expenditures will fund initiatives that are expected to fuel growth support innovative products and continue hmm initiatives throughout the supply chain 

cash flows from financing activities 

 

 financing activities used 22 billion of cash in fiscal 2019 compared to providing 54 billion in fiscal 2018 we had 12 billion of net debt repayments in fiscal 2019 compared to 63 billion of net debt issuances in fiscal 2018 which partially funded the acquisition of blue buffalo for more information on our debt issuances and payments please refer to note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

during fiscal 2019 we received 241 million of net proceeds from common stock issued on exercised options compared to 99 million in fiscal 2018 during fiscal 2018 we received 970 million of net proceeds from common stock issued to fund a portion of the blue buffalo acquisition 

share repurchases in fiscal 2019 were insignificant during fiscal 2018 we repurchased 11 million shares of our common stock for 602 million 

dividends paid in fiscal 2019 totaled 1182 million or 196 per share consistent with fiscal 2018 

 

selected cash flows from joint ventures 

selected cash flows from our joint ventures are set forth in the following table 

 

 capital resources 

total capital consisted of the following 

 

 the following table details the feepaid committed and uncommitted credit lines we had available as of may 26 2019 

 

 to ensure availability of funds we maintain bank credit lines sufficient to cover our outstanding notes payable commercial paper is a continuing source of shortterm financing we have commercial paper programs available to us in the united states and europe we also have uncommitted and assetbacked credit lines that support our foreign operations 

certain of our longterm debt agreements our credit facilities and our noncontrolling interests contain restrictive covenants as of may 26 2019 we were in compliance with all of these covenants 

we have 1396 million of longterm debt maturing in the next 12 months that is classified as current including 500 million of 22 percent notes due october 2019 €3000 eurodenominated 00 percent notes due january 2020 and €5000 million eurodenominated floatingrate notes due january 2020 we believe that cash flows from operations together with available short and longterm debt financing will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for at least the next 12 months 

 

as of may 26 2019 our total debt including the impact of derivative instruments designated as hedges was 74 percent in fixedrate and 26 percent in floatingrate instruments compared to 73 percent in fixedrate and 27 percent in floatingrate instruments on may 27 2018 

our net debt to operating cash flow ratio declined to 50 in fiscal 2019 from 54 in fiscal 2018 primarily driven by a decrease in longterm debt our net debttoadjusted earnings before net interest income taxes depreciation and amortization ratio declined to 39 in fiscal 2019 from 42 on a pro forma basis in fiscal 2018 consistent with our plans to reduce our leverage following our acquisition of blue buffalo see the “nongaap measures” section below for our use of this measure not defined by gaap 

we have a 51 percent controlling interest in yoplait sas and a 50 percent interest in yoplait marques snc and liberté marques sàrl sodiaal international sodiaal holds the remaining interests in each of these entities we consolidate these entities into our consolidated financial statements we record sodiaal’s 50 percent interest in yoplait marques snc and liberté marques sàrl as noncontrolling interests and its 49 percent interest in yoplait sas as a redeemable interest on our consolidated balance sheets these euro and canadian dollardenominated interests are reported in us dollars on our consolidated balance sheets sodiaal has the ability to put all or a portion of its redeemable interest to us at fair value once per year up to three times before december 2024 as of may 26 2019 the redemption value of the redeemable interest was 552 million which approximates its fair value 

during the second quarter of fiscal 2019 sodiaal invested 56 million in yoplait sas 

the thirdparty holder of the general mills cereals llc gmc class a interests receives quarterly preferred distributions from available net income based on the application of a floating preferred return rate to the holder’s capital account balance established in the most recent marktomarket valuation currently 252 million on june 1 2018 the floating preferred return rate on gmc’s class a interests was reset to the sum of threemonth libor plus 1425 basis points the preferred return rate is adjusted every three years through a negotiated agreement with the class a interest holder or through a remarketing auction 

we have an option to purchase the class a interests for consideration equal to the then current capital account value plus any unpaid preferred return and the prescribed makewhole amount if we purchase these interests any change in the thirdparty holder’s capital account from its original value will be charged directly to retained earnings and will increase or decrease the net earnings used to calculate eps in that period 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

as of may 26 2019 we have issued guarantees and comfort letters of 682 million for the debt and other obligations of consolidated subsidiaries and guarantees and comfort letters of 134 million for the debt and other obligations of nonconsolidated affiliates mainly cpw in addition offbalance sheet arrangements are generally limited to the future payments under noncancelable operating leases which totaled 483 million as of may 26 2019 

as of may 26 2019 we invested in four variable interest entities vies none of our vies are material to our results of operations financial condition or liquidity as of and for the fiscal year ended may 26 2019 

our defined benefit plans in the united states are subject to the requirements of the pension protection act ppa in the future the ppa may require us to make additional contributions to our domestic plans we do not expect to be required to make any contributions in fiscal 2020 

 

the following table summarizes our future estimated cash payments under existing contractual obligations including payments due by period 

 

     significant accounting estimates 

for a complete description of our significant accounting policies please see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report our significant accounting estimates are those that have a meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations these estimates include our accounting for promotional expenditures valuation of longlived assets intangible assets redeemable interest stockbased compensation income taxes and defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plans 

revenue recognition 

our revenues are reported net of variable consideration and consideration payable to our customers including trade promotion consumer coupon redemption and other costs including estimated allowances for returns unsalable product and prompt pay discounts trade promotions are recorded using significant judgment of estimated participation and performance levels for offered programs at the time of sale differences between estimated expenses and actual costs are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period our accrued trade liabilities were 484 million as of may 26 2019 and 500 million as of may 27 2018 because these amounts are significant if our estimates are inaccurate we would have to make adjustments in subsequent periods that could have a significant effect on our results of operations 

 

valuation of longlived assets 

we estimate the useful lives of longlived assets and make estimates concerning undiscounted cash flows to review for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent appraisals as appropriate 

intangible assets 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are not subject to amortization and are tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred our estimates of fair value for goodwill impairment testing are determined based on a discounted cash flow model we use inputs from our longrange planning process to determine growth rates for sales and profits we also make estimates of discount rates perpetuity growth assumptions market comparables and other factors 

we evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets mainly brands to determine if they are finite or indefinitelived reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry known technological advances legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets intangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized on a straightline basis over their useful lives generally ranging from 4 to 30 years our estimate of the fair value of our brand assets is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs which include projected revenues from our longrange plan assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands and a discount rate 

as of may 26 2019 we had 206 billion of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets while we currently believe that the fair value of each intangible exceeds its carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses or a different weightedaverage cost of capital could result in material impairment losses and amortization expense we performed our fiscal 2019 assessment of our intangible assets as of the first day of the second quarter of fiscal 2019 as a result of lower sales projections in our longrange plans for the businesses supporting the progresso  food should taste good  and mountain high brand intangible assets we recorded the following impairment charges 

 

 significant assumptions used in that assessment included our longrange cash flow projections for the businesses royalty rates weightedaverage cost of capital rates and tax rates 

 

our latin america reporting unit and the yoki brand intangible asset had fair values that were not substantially in excess of the carry value the excess fair value as of the fiscal 2019 test date of the latin america reporting unit and the yoki brand intangible asset were as follows 

 

 while having significant coverage as of our fiscal 2019 assessment date the pillsbury brand intangible asset and us yogurt reporting unit had risk of decreasing coverage we will continue to monitor these businesses for potential impairment 

redeemable interest 

in fiscal 2019 we adjusted the redemption value of sodiaal’s redeemable interest in yoplait sas based on a discounted cash flow model the significant assumptions used to estimate the redemption value include projected revenue growth and profitability from our longrange plan capital spending depreciation and taxes foreign currency exchange rates and a discount rate as of may 26 2019 the redemption value of the redeemable interest was 552 million 

stockbased compensation 

the valuation of stock options is a significant accounting estimate that requires us to use judgments and assumptions that are likely to have a material impact on our financial statements annually we make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility employee exercise behavior dividend yield and the forfeiture rate for more information on these assumptions please see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

the estimated fair values of stock options granted and the assumptions used for the blackscholes optionpricing model were as follows 

 

 the riskfree interest rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based on the us treasury zerocoupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant an increase in the expected term by 1 year leaving all other assumptions constant would increase the grant date fair value by 9 percent if all other assumptions are held constant a one percentage point increase in our fiscal 2019 volatility assumption would increase the grant date fair value of our fiscal 2019 option awards by 8 percent 

to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our assumptions we are not required to true up grantdate fair valuebased expense to final intrinsic values historical data has a significant bearing on our forwardlooking assumptions significant variances between actual and predicted experience could lead to prospective revisions in our assumptions which could then significantly impact the yearoveryear comparability of stockbased compensation expense 

 

any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings referred to as a windfall tax benefit is presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows as an operating cash flow the actual impact on future years’ cash flows will depend in part on the volume of employee stock option exercises during a particular year and the relationship between the exercisedate market value of the underlying stock and the original grantdate fair value previously determined for financial reporting purposes 

realized windfall tax benefits and shortfall tax deficiencies related to the exercise or vesting of stockbased awards are recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings because employee stock option exercise behavior is not within our control it is possible that significantly different reported results could occur if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail 

income taxes 

we apply a morelikelythannot threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions accordingly we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement future changes in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect earnings in the quarter of such change for more information on income taxes please see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plans 

we have defined benefit pension plans covering many employees in the united states canada switzerland france and the united kingdom we also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to many of our retirees in the united states canada and brazil under certain circumstances we also provide accruable benefits primarily severance to former and inactive employees in the united states canada and mexico please see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for a description of our defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plans 

we recognize benefits provided during retirement or following employment over the plan participants’ active working lives accordingly we make various assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement of our obligations assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our net periodic benefit expense or income and accumulated benefit obligations include the longterm rates of return on plan assets the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our benefit plans and health care cost trend rates 

expected rate of return on plan assets 

our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation our historical longterm investment performance our estimate of future longterm returns by asset class using input from our actuaries investment services and investment managers and longterm inflation assumptions we review this assumption annually for each plan however our annual investment performance for one particular year does not by itself significantly influence our evaluation 

our historical investment returns compound annual growth rates for our united states defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets were 66 percent 66 percent 103 percent 84 percent and 79 percent for the 1 5 10 15 and 20 year periods ended may 26 2019 

on a weightedaverage basis the expected rate of return for all defined benefit plans was 725 percent for fiscal 2019 788 percent for fiscal 2018 and 817 percent for fiscal 2017 for fiscal 2020 we lowered our weightedaverage expected rate of return on plan assets for our principal defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in the united states to 70 percent due to asset allocation changes and expected asset returns 

lowering the expected longterm rate of return on assets by 100 basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense by 70 million for fiscal 2020 a marketrelated valuation basis is used to reduce 

 

yeartoyear expense volatility the marketrelated valuation recognizes certain investment gains or losses over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the marketrelated value of assets and the actual return based on the marketrelated value of assets our outside actuaries perform these calculations as part of our determination of annual expense or income 

discount rates 

we estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic benefit expense for our united states and most of our international defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plans utilizing a full yield curve approach by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of may 31 for our defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plan obligations we work with our outside actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan participants and using the aa above median corporate bond yield to develop a forward interest rate curve including a margin to that index based on our credit risk this forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions 

our weightedaverage discount rates were as follows 

 

 lowering the discount rates by 100 basis points would increase our net defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plan expense for fiscal 2020 by approximately 55 million all obligationrelated experience gains and losses are amortized using a straightline method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants or over the average remaining lifetime of the remaining plan participants if the plan is viewed as “all or almost all” inactive participants 

health care cost trend rates 

we review our health care cost trend rates annually our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims experience and information provided by our actuaries this information includes recent plan experience plan design overall industry experience and projections and assumptions used by other similar organizations our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with this review recent experiences and shortterm expectations our initial health care cost trend rate assumption is 67 percent for retirees age 65 and over and 64 percent for retirees under age 65 at the end of fiscal 2019 rates are graded down annually until the ultimate trend rate of 45 percent is reached in 2029 for all retirees the trend rates are applicable for calculations only if the retirees’ benefits increase as a result of health care inflation the ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually as necessary to approximate the current economic view on the rate of longterm inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium assumed trend rates for health care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans 

 

a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate would have the following effects 

 

 any arising health care claims costrelated experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculation of expected future claims once recognized experience gains and losses are amortized using a straightline method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants or over the average remaining lifetime of the remaining plan participants if the plan is viewed as “all or almost all” inactive participants 

financial statement impact 

in fiscal 2019 we recorded net defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plan expense of 24 million compared to 23 million of expense in fiscal 2018 and 56 million of expense in fiscal 2017 as of may 26 2019 we had cumulative unrecognized actuarial net losses of 20 billion on our defined benefit pension plans and cumulative unrecognized actuarial net gains of 81 million on our postretirement and postemployment benefit plans mainly as the result of liability increases from lower interest rates partially offset by recent increases in the values of plan assets these unrecognized actuarial net losses will result in increases in our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses because they currently exceed the corridors defined by gaap 

actual future net defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plan income or expense will depend on investment performance changes in future discount rates changes in health care cost trend rates and other factors related to the populations participating in these plans 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in august 2017 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new hedge accounting requirements the new standard amends the hedge accounting recognition and presentation requirements to better align an entity’s risk management activities and financial reporting the new standard also simplifies the application of hedge accounting guidance the requirements of the new standard are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2018 and interim periods within those annual periods which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2020 we do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 

in february 2016 the fasb issued new accounting requirements for accounting presentation and classification of leases this will result in certain leases being capitalized as a right of use asset with a related liability on our consolidated balance sheets the requirements of the new standard and subsequent amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2018 and interim periods within those annual periods which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2020 the requirements of the new standard and subsequent amendments allow for either the modified retrospective transition approach which requires application of the guidance in all comparative periods presented or the cumulative effect adjustment approach which requires application of the guidance at the adoption date 

we are in the process of implementing lease accounting software developing a centralized business process and implementing corresponding controls we have substantially completed our analysis of the impact of this standard on our lease portfolio we will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 using the cumulative effect adjustment approach and electing certain practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance including not reassessing whether existing contracts contain leases and carrying forward the historical 

 

classification of those leases in addition we will also elect to not recognize leases with an initial term of 12 months or less on our consolidated balance sheets we do not expect the effects to the consolidated financial statements to be pervasive we estimate that we will record right of use assets and related liabilities of approximately 400 to 500 million subject to the completion of our assessment and the fluctuation of our lease portfolio and discount rates we do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated statements of earnings or our consolidated statements of cash flows see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for noncancelable future lease commitments 

nongaap measures 

we have included in this report measures of financial performance that are not defined by gaap we believe that these measures provide useful information to investors and include these measures in other communications to investors

our fiscal 2020 outlook for organic net sales growth and adjusted operating profit and adjusted diluted eps are nongaap financial measures that exclude or have otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability including the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations restructuring charges and projectrelated costs acquisition integration costs and commodity marktomarket effects our fiscal 2020 outlook for organic net sales growth also excludes the effect of a 53rd week acquisitions and divestitures we are not able to reconcile these forwardlooking nongaap financial measures to their most directly comparable forwardlooking gaap financial measures without unreasonable efforts because we are unable to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the actual impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices or the timing of acquisitions divestitures and restructuring actions throughout fiscal 2020 the unavailable information could have a significant impact on our fiscal 2020 gaap financial results 

for fiscal 2020 we currently expect foreign currency exchange rates based on a blend of forward and forecasted rates and hedge positions acquisitions divestitures and a 53rd week to increase net sales growth by approximately 1 to 2 percentage points foreign currency exchange rates to have an immaterial impact on adjusted operating profit and adjusted diluted eps growth and restructuring charges and projectrelated costs related to actions previously announced to total approximately 49 million

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates and commodity and equity prices changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows in the normal course of business we actively manage our exposure to these market risks by entering into various hedging transactions authorized under established policies that place clear controls on these activities the counterparties in these transactions are generally highly rated institutions we establish credit limits for each counterparty our hedging transactions include but are not limited to a variety of derivative financial instruments for information on interest rate foreign exchange commodity price and equity instrument risk please see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

value at risk 

the estimates in the table below are intended to measure the maximum potential fair value we could lose in one day from adverse changes in market interest rates foreign exchange rates commodity prices and equity prices under normal market conditions a monte carlo valueatrisk var methodology was used to quantify the market risk for our exposures the models assumed normal market conditions and used a 95 percent confidence level 

the var calculation used historical interest and foreign exchange rates and commodity and equity prices from the past year to estimate the potential volatility and correlation of these rates in the future the market data were drawn from the riskmetrics ™ data set the calculations are not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that we expect to incur further since the hedging instrument the derivative inversely correlates with the underlying exposure we would expect that any loss or gain in the fair value of our derivatives would be generally offset by an increase or decrease in the fair value of the underlying exposure the positions included in the calculations were debt investments interest rate swaps foreign exchange forwards commodity swaps futures and options and equity instruments the calculations do not include the underlying foreign exchange and commodities or equityrelated positions that are offset by these marketrisksensitive instruments 

 

the table below presents the estimated maximum potential var arising from a oneday loss in fair value for our interest rate foreign currency commodity and equity marketrisksensitive instruments outstanding as of may 26 2019 and may 27 2018 and the average fair value impact during the year ended may 26 2019

 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties any of the risks described below could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the categories in which we participate are very competitive and if we are not able to compete effectively our results of operations could be adversely affected 

the consumer and pet food categories in which we participate are very competitive our principal competitors in these categories are manufacturers as well as retailers with their own branded and private label products competitors market and sell their products through brickandmortar stores and ecommerce all of our principal competitors have substantial financial marketing and other resources in most product categories we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products but also with regional brands and with generic and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices competition in our product categories is based on product innovation product quality price brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing promotional activity convenient ordering and delivery to the consumer and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences if our large competitors were to seek an advantage through pricing or promotional changes we could choose to do the same which could adversely affect our margins and profitability if we did not do the 

 

same our revenues and market share could be adversely affected our market share and revenue growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing innovative products in response to changing consumer demands or by new product introductions of our competitors if we are unable to build and sustain brand equity by offering recognizably superior product quality we may be unable to maintain premium pricing over generic and private label products 

we may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face of a consolidating retail environment 

there has been significant consolidation in the grocery industry resulting in customers with increased purchasing power in addition large retail customers may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency lower pricing increased reliance on their own brand name products increased emphasis on generic and other economy brands and increased promotional programs if we are unable to use our scale marketing expertise product innovation knowledge of consumers’ needs and category leadership positions to respond to these demands our profitability and volume growth could be negatively impacted in addition the loss of any large customer could adversely affect our sales and profits in fiscal 2018 walmart accounted for 21 percent of our consolidated net sales and 30 percent of net sales of our north america retail segment in its fiscal year ended december 31 2017 petsmart including chewycom as of june 1 2017 and petco accounted for 41 percent and 18 percent respectively of blue buffalo’s net sales national pet superstore chains have experienced reduced store traffic if national pet superstore chains continue to experience reduced store traffic or experience any operational difficulties our pet segment operating results may be adversely affected for more information on significant customers please see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

price changes for the commodities we depend on for raw materials packaging and energy may adversely affect our profitability 

the principal raw materials that we use are commodities that experience price volatility caused by external conditions such as weather product scarcity limited sources of supply commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations commodity price changes may result in unexpected increases in raw material packaging and energy costs if we are unable to increase productivity to offset these increased costs or increase our prices we may experience reduced margins and profitability we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and the risk management procedures that we do use may not always work as we intend 

volatility in the market value of derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices will cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings 

we utilize derivatives to manage price risk for some of our principal ingredient and energy costs including grains oats wheat and corn oils principally soybean dairy products natural gas and diesel fuel changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded in earnings currently resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings these gains and losses are reported in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of earnings and in unallocated corporate items outside our segment operating results until we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating profit we also record our grain inventories at net realizable value we may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments 

if we are not efficient in our production our profitability could suffer as a result of the highly competitive environment in which we operate 

our future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to be efficient in the production and manufacture of our products in highly competitive markets gaining additional efficiencies may become more difficult over time our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or by eliminating redundant costs 

 

resulting from acquisitions or divestitures could adversely affect our profitability and weaken our competitive position many productivity initiatives involve complex reorganization of manufacturing facilities and production lines such manufacturing realignment may result in the interruption of production which may negatively impact product volume and margins we are currently pursuing several multiyear restructuring and cost savings initiatives designed to increase our efficiency and reduce expenses if we are unable to execute those initiatives as planned we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

disruption of our supply chain could adversely affect our business 

our ability to make move and sell products is critical to our success damage or disruption to raw material supplies or our manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather including any potential effects of climate change natural disaster fire terrorism cyberattack pandemic strikes importexport restrictions or other factors could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products many of our product lines are manufactured at a single location our suppliers’ policies and practices can damage our reputation and the quality and safety of our products failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or to effectively manage such events if they occur particularly when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location could adversely affect our business and results of operations as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain 

concerns with the safety and quality of food products could cause consumers to avoid certain food products or ingredients 

we could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients adverse publicity about these types of concerns whether or not valid may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions 

if our products become adulterated misbranded or mislabeled we might need to recall those items and may experience product liability claims if consumers or their pets are injured 

we may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated misbranded or mislabeled a widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time we could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us a significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity damage to our reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in our products which could have an adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands 

we may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and trends which may result in decreased demand for our products 

our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes eating habits and purchasing behaviors of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences in channels where they shop consumer preferences and categorylevel consumption may change from time to time and can be affected by a number of different trends and other factors if we fail to anticipate identify or react to these changes and trends such as adapting to emerging ecommerce channels or to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis we may experience reduced demand for our products which would in turn cause our revenues and profitability to suffer similarly demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns regarding the health effects of ingredients such as sodium trans fats genetically modified organisms sugar processed wheat or other product ingredients or attributes 

 

we may be unable to grow our market share or add products that are in faster growing and more profitable categories 

the food industry’s growth potential is constrained by population growth our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business faster than populations are growing in the markets that we serve one way to achieve that growth is to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new products in faster growing and more profitable categories our future results will also depend on our ability to increase market share in our existing product categories if we do not succeed in developing innovative products for new and existing categories our growth may slow which could adversely affect our profitability 

economic downturns could limit consumer demand for our products 

the willingness of consumers to purchase our products depends in part on local economic conditions in periods of economic uncertainty consumers may purchase more generic private label and other economy brands and may forego certain purchases altogether in those circumstances we could experience a reduction in sales of higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings in addition as a result of economic conditions or competitive actions we may be unable to raise our prices sufficiently to protect margins consumers may also reduce the amount of food that they consume away from home at customers that purchase products from our convenience stores  foodservice segment any of these events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

our results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands 

maintaining and continually enhancing the value of our many iconic brands is critical to the success of our business the value of our brands is based in large part on the degree to which consumers react and respond positively to these brands brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner adverse publicity about our products our failure to maintain the quality of our products the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences concerns about food safety or our products becoming unavailable to consumers consumer demand for our products may also be impacted by changes in the level of advertising or promotional support the use of social and digital media by consumers us and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared negative posts or comments about us our brands or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation if we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands our business results could be negatively impacted 

our international operations are subject to political and economic risks 

in fiscal 2018 29 percent of our consolidated net sales were generated outside of the united states we are accordingly subject to a number of risks relating to doing business internationally any of which could significantly harm our business these risks include 

 

       our financial performance on a us dollar denominated basis is subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates these fluctuations could cause material variations in our results of operations our principal exposures are 

 

to the australian dollar brazilian real british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese renminbi euro japanese yen mexican peso and swiss franc from time to time we enter into agreements that are intended to reduce the effects of our exposure to currency fluctuations but these agreements may not be effective in significantly reducing our exposure 

new regulations or regulatorybased claims could adversely affect our business 

our facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the united states department of agriculture the federal food and drug administration the occupational safety and health administration and other federal state local and foreign governmental agencies relating to the production packaging labelling storage distribution quality and safety of food products and the health and safety of our employees our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits administrative penalties and civil remedies including fines injunctions and recalls of our products we advertise our products and could be the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal state and foreign laws and regulations we may also be subject to new laws or regulations restricting our right to advertise our products including restrictions on the audience to whom products are marketed changes in laws or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements on us could increase our cost of doing business or restrict our actions causing our results of operations to be adversely affected 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations our failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits administrative penalties and civil remedies we are currently party to a variety of environmental remediation obligations due to regulatory complexities uncertainties inherent in litigation and the risk of unidentified contaminants on current and former properties of ours the potential exists for remediation liability indemnification and compliance costs to differ from our estimates we cannot guarantee that our costs in relation to these matters or compliance with environmental laws in general will not exceed our established liabilities or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could limit financing and other options and in some cases adversely affect our ability to pay dividends 

as of may 27 2018 we had total debt redeemable interests and noncontrolling interests of 169 billion the agreements under which we have issued indebtedness do not prevent us from incurring additional unsecured indebtedness in the future our level of indebtedness may limit our 

 

  there are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments and noncontrolling interests if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the related indebtedness and other unrelated indebtedness could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity and our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing may also be adversely affected 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt and other obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control 

 

global capital and credit market issues could negatively affect our liquidity increase our costs of borrowing and disrupt the operations of our suppliers and customers 

we depend on stable liquid and wellfunctioning capital and credit markets to fund our operations although we believe that our operating cash flows financial assets access to capital and credit markets and revolving credit agreements will permit us to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future there can be no assurance that future volatility or disruption in the capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing we also utilize interest rate derivatives to reduce the volatility of our financing costs if we are not effective in hedging this volatility we may experience an increase in our costs of borrowing our business could also be negatively impacted if our suppliers or customers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy 

volatility in the securities markets interest rates and other factors could substantially increase our defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit costs 

we sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the united states canada and various foreign locations including defined benefit pension retiree health and welfare severance and other postemployment plans our major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments changes in interest rates mortality rates health care costs early retirement rates investment returns and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plans a significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations 

our business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or are breached 

information technology serves an important role in the efficient and effective operation of our business we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information to manage a variety of business processes and to comply with regulatory legal and tax requirements our information technology systems and infrastructure are critical to effectively manage our key business processes including digital marketing order entry and fulfillment supply chain management finance administration and other business processes these technologies enable internal and external communication among our locations employees suppliers customers and others and include the receipt and storage of personal information about our employees consumers and proprietary business information our information technology systems some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties may be vulnerable to damage interruption or shutdown due to any number of causes such as catastrophic events natural disasters fires power outages systems failures telecommunications failures security breaches computer viruses hackers employee error or malfeasance and other causes increased cybersecurity threats pose a potential risk to the security and viability of our information technology systems as well as the confidentiality integrity and availability of the data stored on those systems the failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and result in transaction errors processing inefficiencies data loss legal claims or proceedings regulatory penalties and the loss of sales and customers any interruption of our information technology systems could have operational reputational legal and financial impacts that may have a material adverse effect on our business 

a change in the assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses or a different weightedaverage cost of capital used to value our reporting units or our indefinitelived intangible assets could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth 

as of may 27 2018 we had 209 billion of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets goodwill for each of our reporting units is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate 

 

that impairment may have occurred we compare the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill to the fair value of the reporting unit if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill impairment has occurred our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our longrange planning process we also make estimates of discount rates perpetuity growth assumptions market comparables and other factors our latin america and us yogurt reporting units have experienced declining business performance and we continue to monitor these businesses while we currently believe that our goodwill is not impaired different assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses could result in significant impairment losses 

we evaluate the useful lives of our intangible assets primarily intangible assets associated with the blue buffalo pillsbury  totino’s  progresso  yoplait  old el paso  yoki  häagendazs  and annie’s brands to determine if they are finite or indefinitelived reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry known technological advances legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 

our indefinitelived intangible assets are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable our estimate of the fair value of the brands is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs including projected revenues from our longrange plan assumed royalty rates which could be payable if we did not own the brands and a discount rate our yoki  mountain high  progresso  food should taste good  and green giant brands have experienced declining business performance and we will continue to monitor these businesses for further information on goodwill and intangible assets please refer to note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the blue buffalo acquisition or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected 

our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the blue buffalo acquisition will depend to a large extent on our ability to integrate blue buffalo which is a complex costly and timeconsuming process we have never operated in the pet food sector and our lack of experience in this sector may hinder our ability to manage blue buffalo successfully following the acquisition 

the integration process may disrupt our business and if implemented ineffectively could restrict the realization of the full expected benefits the failure to meet the challenges involved in the integration process and to realize the anticipated benefits of the blue buffalo acquisition could cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in our operations and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition the integration of blue buffalo may result in material unanticipated problems expenses liabilities competitive responses and loss of customers and other business relationships additional integration challenges include 

 

       

    many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and result in us becoming subject to litigation in addition even if blue buffalo is integrated successfully the full anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized including the synergies cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that are anticipated these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all further additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration process all of these factors could cause reductions in our earnings per share and decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the acquisition as a result it cannot be assured that the blue buffalo acquisition will result in the realization of the full or any anticipated benefits 

blue buffalo may underperform relative to our expectations 

the business and financial performance of blue buffalo are subject to certain risks and uncertainties we may not be able to maintain the growth rate levels of revenue earnings or operating efficiency that we and blue buffalo have achieved or might achieve separately our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

our failure to successfully integrate other acquisitions into our existing operations could adversely affect our financial results 

from time to time we evaluate potential acquisitions or joint ventures that would further our strategic objectives our success depends in part upon our ability to integrate acquired and existing operations if we are unable to successfully integrate acquisitions our financial results could suffer additional potential risks associated with acquisitions include additional debt leverage the loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business the assumption of unknown liabilities the inherent risk associated with entering a geographic area or line of business in which we have no or limited prior experience failure to achieve anticipated synergies and the impairment of goodwill or other acquisitionrelated intangible assets

we are a global packaged foods company we develop distinctive valueadded food products and market them under unique brand names we work continuously to improve our core products and to create new products that meet consumers’ evolving needs and preferences in addition we build the equity of our brands over time with strong consumerdirected marketing innovative new products and effective merchandising we believe our brandbuilding strategy is the key to winning and sustaining leading share positions in markets around the globe 

our fundamental financial goal is to generate superior returns for our shareholders over the long term we believe that increases in net sales segment operating profit earnings per share eps free cash flow cash return to shareholders and return on average total capital are key drivers of financial performance for our business 

our longterm growth objectives are to consistently deliver 

 

      we believe that this financial performance should result in longterm value creation for shareholders 

fiscal 2018 represented an important step in returning our business to sustainable topline growth we made significant progress toward competing more effectively with strong innovation marketing and instore execution driving positive organic sales growth in each of our last three fiscal quarters we also moved to reshape our portfolio for future growth with the acquisition of blue buffalo a fastgrowing highly profitable pet food business while our fullyear profit results fell short of our initial plans we finished fiscal 2018 delivering growth in net sales total segment operating profit adjusted operating profit margin and adjusted diluted eps in the fourth quarter we maintained a disciplined focus on cash generation resulting in significant growth in free cash flow this year we generated substantial holistic margin management hmm savings and we reached our expected annualized savings goal of 700 million in fiscal 2018 compared to the fiscal 2015 base from recent restructuring actions however these results were not enough to offset heightened input cost inflation increases in other costs impacting cost of sales and higher merchandising expense importantly we made investments to accelerate our differential growth platforms and expanded our capabilities in ecommerce and strategic revenue management srm which are critical to future growth 

net sales growth rates for our north american retail operating segment improved significantly compared to fiscal 2017 as good consumer marketing support strong innovation and improved instore execution helped restore momentum our convenience stores  foodservice operating segment’s net sales increased on innovation behind focus 6 platforms and marketindex pricing on flour our europe  australia segment’s net sales increased on favorable foreign currency exchange and successful innovation and distribution expansion for ice cream and snack bars in our asia  latin america segment improved inmarket execution in asia was overshadowed by a difficult general ledger implementation and a comparison to fiscal 2017 that included an extra month of results reported for brazil all of our segments’ operating profit results were impacted by higher than expected input cost inflation that was not fully offset by our hmm initiatives 

our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2018 rose 1 percent to 157 billion on an organic basis net sales essentially matched yearago levels operating profit of 25 billion decreased 2 percent total segment operating 

 

profit of 28 billion declined 5 percent and declined 6 percent on a constantcurrency basis diluted eps of 364 was up 31 percent compared to fiscal 2017 adjusted diluted eps which excludes certain items affecting comparability of results was up 1 percent to 311 per share and was flat on a constantcurrency basis our return on average total capital was 127 percent and adjusted return on average total capital decreased 190 basis points to 97 percent and decreased 200 basis points on a constantcurrency basis see the “nongaap measures” section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap 

net cash provided by operations totaled 28 billion in fiscal 2018 representing a conversion rate of 131 percent of net earnings including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests this cash generation supported capital investments totaling 623 million and our resulting free cash flow was 22 billion at a conversion rate of 120 percent of adjusted net earnings including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests we also returned significant cash to shareholders through dividends totaling 11 billion and share repurchases totaling 602 million 

a detailed review of our fiscal 2018 performance appears below in the section titled “fiscal 2018 consolidated results of operations” 

as we turn to fiscal 2019 we remain focused on our consumer first strategy and our global growth priorities to further improve our topline momentum we plan to compete effectively across all our brands and geographies increase investments to accelerate our differential growth platforms and maximize the growth opportunities for blue buffalo as we integrate the business into the general mills portfolio we also plan to maintain our efficiency in this more inflationary cost environment and we have initiatives underway to help protect our profitability we expect the operating environment in fiscal 2019 to continue to be dynamic requiring us to increase our agility while remaining focused on delivering on consumers’ expectations our fiscal 2019 targets reflect the investments we are making to enhance our capabilities and accelerate our growth as well as the impact of adding blue buffalo to our portfolio we believe that these initiatives will drive strong returns over the long term and further advance us toward our goal of consistently delivering profitable growth and toptier returns for our shareholders 

our key fullyear fiscal 2019 targets include 

 

   we continue to pursue our consumer first strategy and execute against our three key growth priorities 1 competing effectively on all brands and across all geographies through strong innovation effective consumer marketing and excellent instore execution 2 accelerating growth on our four differential growth platforms including h ä agendazs ice cream snack bars old el paso mexican food and our portfolio of natural and organic food brands and 3 reshaping our portfolio through growthenhancing transactions including the recent acquisition of blue buffalo we also intend to pursue divestitures of growthdilutive businesses to further reshape our portfolio by focusing on these priorities we expect to generate consistent topline growth which when balanced with a disciplined focus on margin expansion cash conversion and cash returns should create significant value for our shareholders

fiscal 2018 consolidated results of operations 

on april 24 2018 we acquired blue buffalo which became our pet operating segment we are reporting the pet operating segment results on a onemonth lag and accordingly in fiscal 2018 our results do not include pet segment operating results 

in fiscal 2018 net sales increased 1 percent compared to last year operating profit margin of 159 percent was down 50 basis points from yearago levels primarily driven by lower segment operating profit results partially offset by a decrease in restructuring impairment and other exit costs and favorable marktomarket valuation of certain commodity positions adjusted operating profit margin decreased 90 basis points to 172 percent primarily driven by higher input costs including currencydriven inflation on imported products in certain markets partially offset by lower selling general and administrative expenses diluted earnings per share of 364 increased 31 percent compared to fiscal 2017 and adjusted diluted eps which excludes certain items affecting comparability essentially matched yearago levels on a constantcurrency basis see the “nongaap measures” section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by gaap 

a summary of our consolidated financial results for fiscal 2018 follows 

 

  consolidated net sales were as follows 

 

  the 1 percent increase in net sales in fiscal 2018 was primarily driven by favorable net price realization and mix and favorable foreign currency exchange partially offset by lower contributions from volume growth the convenience stores  foodservice and europe  australia segments contributed to the increase in net sales in fiscal 2018 compared to the same period last year while the north america retail and asia  latin america segments decreased 

organic net sales in fiscal 2018 were flat compared to fiscal 2017 with contributions from organic volume growth in the convenience stores  foodservice segment offset by organic volume declines in the europe  australia and asia  latin america segments 

 

components of organic net sales growth are shown in the following table 

 

  cost of sales increased 257 million in fiscal 2018 to 10313 million the increase included a 452 million increase attributable to product rate and mix and a 116 million decrease attributable to lower volume we recorded a 32 million net decrease in cost of sales related to marktomarket valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories as described in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report compared to a net decrease of 14 million in fiscal 2017 in fiscal 2018 we recorded 14 million of restructuring charges in cost of sales compared to 42 million in fiscal 2017 we also recorded 11 million of restructuring initiative projectrelated costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2018 compared to 44 million in fiscal 2017 please see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

gross margin declined 2 percent in fiscal 2018 versus fiscal 2017 gross margin as a percent of net sales of 34 percent decreased 110 basis points compared to fiscal 2017 

selling general and administrative sga expenses decreased 49 million to 2753 million in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 the decrease in sga expenses primarily reflects savings from cost management initiatives and an 8 percentage point decrease in media and advertising expense in addition we recorded 34 million of transaction and integration costs related to our acquisition of blue buffalo sga expenses as a percent of net sales in fiscal 2018 decreased 40 basis points compared to fiscal 2017 

restructuring impairment and other exit costs totaled 166 million in fiscal 2018 compared to 183 million in fiscal 2017 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 we executed our fiscal 2019 planning process and preliminary longrange planning process which resulted in lower future sales and profitability projections in our plans for our businesses supporting the yoki  mountain high  and immaculate baking brand intangible assets as a result we recorded a 97 million impairment charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 

in fiscal 2018 we approved global cost savings initiatives designed to reduce administrative costs and align resources behind high growth initiatives we recorded 49 million of restructuring charges relating to this action in fiscal 2018 

 

other charges associated with our restructuring initiatives recognized in fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016 consisted of the following 

 

   please refer to note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information regarding our restructuring activities 

interest net for fiscal 2018 totaled 374 million 79 million higher than fiscal 2017 primarily driven by 36 million of charges related to the bridge term loan credit facility that provided backup financing for the blue buffalo acquisition higher average debt balances and 14 million of charges related to the repurchase of medium term notes partially offset by changes in the mix of debt 

our consolidated effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was 27 percent compared to 288 percent in fiscal 2017 the 261 percentage point decrease was primarily due to the provisional net benefit of 524 million recorded in fiscal 2018 related to the tax cuts and jobs act tcja our effective tax rate excluding certain items affecting comparability was 257 percent in fiscal 2018 compared to 292 percent in fiscal 2017 see the “nongaap measures” section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by gaap the 35 percentage point decrease in the effective tax rate excluding certain items affecting comparability was primarily due to the lower us federal blended statutory rate for fiscal 2018 as a result of the tcja partially offset by certain discrete events recorded during fiscal 2017 

on december 22 2017 the tcja was signed into law the tcja significantly revised the us corporate income tax system including a reduction in the us corporate income tax rate implementation of a territorial system and a onetime deemed repatriation tax on untaxed foreign earnings the tcja also resulted in a us federal blended statutory rate of 294 percent for us in fiscal 2018 generally the impacts of the new legislation would be required to be recorded in the period of enactment which for us was the third quarter of fiscal 2018 however accounting standards update 201805 income taxes topic 740  asu 201805 was issued with guidance allowing for the recognition of provisional amounts in the event that the accounting is not complete and

in fiscal 2017 operating results reflected challenging net sales performance however we continued to make progress against our cost savings and margin expansion initiatives the net sales decline of 6 percent was driven by declining contributions from volume in the north america retail and europe  australia segments including the impact of the divestiture of the north american green giant product lines in fiscal 2016 which were partially offset by favorable net price realization and mix operating profit margin of 164 percent was up 10 basis points from fiscal 2016 levels primarily driven by benefits from cost savings and spending optimization initiatives and favorable net price realization partially offset by the gain from the green giant divestiture adjusted operating profit margin increased 130 basis points to 181 percent driven by benefits from cost savings and spending optimization initiatives and favorable net price realization diluted eps of 277 was flat to fiscal 2016 and adjusted diluted eps which excludes certain items affecting comparability on a constantcurrency basis increased 6 percent compared to fiscal 2016 see the “nongaap measures” section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by gaap

cash flows from operations

selected cash flows from joint ventures 

selected cash flows from our joint ventures are set forth in the following table 

 

 capital resources 

total capital consisted of the following 

 

 the following table details the feepaid committed and uncommitted credit lines we had available as of may 27 2018 

 

 in february 2018 we entered into a feepaid commitment letter with certain lenders pursuant to which such lenders committed to provide a 364day senior unsecured bridge term loan credit facility the “bridge facility” in an aggregate principal amount of up to 85 billion to provide the financing for the acquisition of blue buffalo the bridge facility expired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 

 

to ensure availability of funds we maintain bank credit lines sufficient to cover our outstanding notes payable commercial paper is a continuing source of shortterm financing we have commercial paper programs available to us in the united states and europe we also have uncommitted and assetbacked credit lines that support our foreign operations the credit facilities contain several covenants including a requirement to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 25 times 

certain of our longterm debt agreements our credit facilities and our noncontrolling interests contain restrictive covenants as of may 27 2018 we were in compliance with all of these covenants 

we have 1600 million of longterm debt maturing in the next 12 months that is classified as current including 1150 million of 565 percent notes due february 2019 €3000 million eurodenominated floatingrate notes due march 20 2019 and 100 million of 659 percent fixed rate medium term notes due for remarketing in october 2018 we believe that cash flows from operations together with available short and longterm debt financing will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for at least the next 12 months 

as of may 27 2018 our total debt including the impact of derivative instruments designated as hedges was 73 percent in fixedrate and 27 percent in floatingrate instruments compared to 67 percent in fixedrate and 33 percent in floatingrate instruments on may 28 2017 

we believe that our fixed charge coverage ratio and the ratio of operating cash flow to debt are important measures of our financial strength our fixed charge coverage ratio in fiscal 2018 was 589 compared to 726 in fiscal 2017 the measure decreased from fiscal 2017 as earnings before income taxes and aftertax earnings from joint ventures decreased by 136 million and interest expense increased by 83 million in fiscal 2018 our operating cash flow to debt ratio decreased 75 percentage points to 180 percent in fiscal 2018 primarily driven by an increase in longterm debt 

we have a 51 percent controlling interest in yoplait sas and a 50 percent interest in yoplait marques snc and liberté marques sàrl sodiaal holds the remaining interests in each of these entities we consolidate these entities into our consolidated financial statements we record sodiaal’s 50 percent interest in yoplait marques snc and liberté marques sàrl as noncontrolling interests and its 49 percent interest in yoplait sas as a redeemable interest on our consolidated balance sheets these euro and canadian dollardenominated interests are reported in us dollars on our consolidated balance sheets sodiaal has the ability to put all or a portion of its redeemable interest to us at fair value once per year up to three times before december 2024 as of may 27 2018 the redemption value of the redeemable interest was 776 million which approximates its fair value 

the thirdparty holder of the general mills cereals llc gmc class a interests receives quarterly preferred distributions from available net income based on the application of a floating preferred return rate to the holder’s capital account balance established in the most recent marktomarket valuation currently 252 million for fiscal 2018 the floating preferred return rate on gmc’s class a interests was equal to the sum of threemonth libor plus 125 basis points the preferred return rate is adjusted every three years through a negotiated agreement with the class a interest holder or through a remarketing auction on june 1 2018 subsequent to our fiscal yearend the floating preferred return rate on the class a interests was reset to the sum of threemonth libor plus 1425 basis points 

we have an option to purchase the class a interests for consideration equal to the then current capital account value plus any unpaid preferred return and the prescribed makewhole amount if we purchase these interests any change in the thirdparty holder’s capital account from its original value will be charged directly to retained earnings and will increase or decrease the net earnings used to calculate eps in that period 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

as of may 27 2018 we have issued guarantees and comfort letters of 541 million for the debt and other obligations of consolidated subsidiaries and guarantees and comfort letters of 167 million for the debt and other 

 

obligations of nonconsolidated affiliates mainly cpw in addition offbalance sheet arrangements are generally limited to the future payments under noncancelable operating leases which totaled 559 million as of may 27 2018

the following table summarizes our future estimated cash payments under existing contractual obligations including payments due by period 

 

     significant accounting estimates 

for a complete description of our significant accounting policies please see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report our significant accounting estimates are those that have a meaningful impact 

 

on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations these estimates include our accounting for promotional expenditures valuation of longlived assets intangible assets redeemable interest stockbased compensation income taxes and defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plans 

promotional expenditures 

our promotional activities are conducted through our customers and directly or indirectly with end consumers these activities include payments to customers to perform merchandising activities on our behalf such as advertising or instore displays discounts to our list prices to lower retail shelf prices payments to gain distribution of new products coupons contests and other incentives and media and advertising expenditures the recognition of these costs requires estimation of customer participation and performance levels these estimates are based on the forecasted customer sales the timing and forecasted costs of promotional activities and other factors differences between estimated expenses and actual costs are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period our accrued trade coupon and consumer marketing liabilities were 500 million as of may 27 2018 and 483 million as of may 28 2017 because our total promotional expenditures including amounts classified as a reduction of revenues are significant if our estimates are inaccurate we would have to make adjustments in subsequent periods that could have a significant effect on our results of operations 

valuation of longlived assets 

we estimate the useful lives of longlived assets and make estimates concerning undiscounted cash flows to review for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent appraisals as appropriate 

intangible assets 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are not subject to amortization and are tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred our estimates of fair value for goodwill impairment testing are determined based on a discounted cash flow model we use inputs from our longrange planning process to determine growth rates for sales and profits we also make estimates of discount rates perpetuity growth assumptions market comparables and other factors 

we evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets mainly brands to determine if they are finite or indefinitelived reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry known technological advances legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets intangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized on a straightline basis over their useful lives generally ranging from 4 to 30 years our estimate of the fair value of our brand assets is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs which include projected revenues from our longrange plan assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands and a discount rate 

as of may 27 2018 we had 209 billion of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets while we currently believe that the fair value of each intangible exceeds its carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses or a different weightedaverage cost of capital could result in material impairment losses and amortization expense we performed our fiscal 2018 assessment of our intangible assets as of august 28 2017 as of our annual assessment date there was no impairment of any of our intangible assets as their related fair values were substantially in excess of the carrying values except for the yoki and progresso brand intangible 

 

assets and the latin america reporting unit the excess fair value as of the fiscal 2018 test date of the yoki and progresso brand intangible assets and the latin america reporting unit was as follows 

 

 in addition while having significant coverage as of our fiscal 2018 assessment date the food should taste good and green giant brand intangible assets and us yogurt reporting unit had risk of decreasing coverage we will continue to monitor these businesses as well as the businesses supporting the yoki and progresso brand intangible assets and the latin america reporting unit for potential impairment 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 we executed our fiscal 2019 planning process and preliminary longrange planning process which resulted in lower future sales and profitability projections in our plans for our businesses supporting the yoki  mountain high  and immaculate baking brand intangible assets as a result of this triggering event we performed an interim impairment assessment of these assets as of may 27 2018 and determined that the fair value of these brand assets no longer exceeded the carrying values of the respective assets significant assumptions used in that assessment included our updated longrange cash flow projections for the businesses royalty rates weighted average cost of capital rates and tax rates we recorded a 97 million impairment charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 related to these assets 

redeemable interest 

in fiscal 2018 we adjusted the redemption value of sodiaal’s redeemable interest in yoplait sas based on a discounted cash flow model the significant assumptions used to estimate the redemption value include projected revenue growth and profitability from our longrange plan capital spending depreciation and taxes foreign currency exchange rates and a discount rate as of may 27 2018 the redemption value of the redeemable interest was 776 million 

stockbased compensation 

the valuation of stock options is a significant accounting estimate that requires us to use judgments and assumptions that are likely to have a material impact on our financial statements annually we make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility employee exercise behavior dividend yield and the forfeiture rate for more information on these assumptions please see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

the estimated fair values of stock options granted and the assumptions used for the blackscholes optionpricing model were as follows 

 

  

the riskfree interest rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based on the us treasury zerocoupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant an increase in the expected term by 1 year leaving all other assumptions constant would increase the grant date fair value by 20 percent if all other assumptions are held constant a one percentage point increase in our fiscal 2018 volatility assumption would increase the grant date fair value of our fiscal 2018 option awards by 8 percent 

to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our assumptions we are not required to true up grantdate fair valuebased expense to final intrinsic values historical data has a significant bearing on our forwardlooking assumptions significant variances between actual and predicted experience could lead to prospective revisions in our assumptions which could then significantly impact the yearoveryear comparability of stockbased compensation expense 

any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings referred to as a windfall tax benefit is presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows as an operating cash flow the actual impact on future years’ cash flows will depend in part on the volume of employee stock option exercises during a particular year and the relationship between the exercisedate market value of the underlying stock and the original grantdate fair value previously determined for financial reporting purposes 

realized windfall tax benefits and shortfall tax deficiencies related to the exercise or vesting of stockbased awards are recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings because employee stock option exercise behavior is not within our control it is possible that significantly different reported results could occur if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail 

income taxes 

we apply a morelikelythannot threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions accordingly we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement future changes in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect earnings in the quarter of such change for more information on income taxes please see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plans 

we have defined benefit pension plans covering many employees in the united states canada switzerland france and the united kingdom we also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to many of our retirees in the united states canada and brazil under certain circumstances we also provide accruable benefits primarily severance to former and inactive employees in the united states canada and mexico please see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for a description of our defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plans 

we recognize benefits provided during retirement or following employment over the plan participants’ active working lives accordingly we make various assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement of our obligations assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our net periodic benefit expense or income and accumulated benefit obligations include the longterm rates of return on plan assets the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our benefit plans and health care cost trend rates 

expected rate of return on plan assets 

our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation our historical longterm investment performance our estimate of future longterm returns by asset class using input from our actuaries investment services and investment managers and longterm inflation assumptions we review this assumption annually for each plan however our annual investment performance for one particular year does not by itself significantly influence our evaluation 

 

our historical investment returns compound annual growth rates for our united states defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets were 85 percent 85 percent 65 percent 91 percent and 80 percent for the 1 5 10 15 and 20 year periods ended may 27 2018 

on a weightedaverage basis the expected rate of return for all defined benefit plans was 788 percent for fiscal 2018 817 percent for fiscal 2017 and 853 percent for fiscal 2016 for fiscal 2019 we lowered our weightedaverage expected rate of return on plan assets for our principal defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in the united states to 735 percent due to asset changes that decreased investment risk in the portfolio 

lowering the expected longterm rate of return on assets by 100 basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense by 67 million for fiscal 2019 a marketrelated valuation basis is used to reduce yeartoyear expense volatility the marketrelated valuation recognizes certain investment gains or losses over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the marketrelated value of assets and the actual return based on the marketrelated value of assets our outside actuaries perform these calculations as part of our determination of annual expense or income 

discount rates 

beginning in fiscal 2017 we changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic benefit expense for our united states and most of our international defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plans we adopted a full yield curve approach to estimate service cost and interest cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows this method provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by correlating the timing of the plans’ liability cash flows to the corresponding rate on the yield curve previously we estimated service cost and interest cost using a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period this change does not affect the measurement of our benefit obligations related to these plans we have accounted for this change prospectively as a change in accounting estimate beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 

our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of may 31 for our defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plan obligations we work with our outside actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan participants and using the aa above median corporate bond yield to develop a forward interest rate curve including a margin to that index based on our credit risk this forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions 

our weightedaverage discount rates were as follows 

 

  

lowering the discount rates by 100 basis points would increase our net defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plan expense for fiscal 2019 by approximately 55 million all obligationrelated experience gains and losses are amortized using a straightline method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants or over the average remaining lifetime of the remaining plan participants if the plan is viewed as “all or almost all” inactive participants 

health care cost trend rates 

we review our health care cost trend rates annually our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims experience and information provided by our actuaries this information includes recent plan experience plan design overall industry experience and projections and assumptions used by other similar organizations our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with this review recent experiences and shortterm expectations our initial health care cost trend rate assumption is 70 percent for retirees age 65 and over and 67 percent for retirees under age 65 at the end of fiscal 2018 rates are graded down annually until the ultimate trend rate of 45 percent is reached in 2029 for all retirees the trend rates are applicable for calculations only if the retirees’ benefits increase as a result of health care inflation the ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually as necessary to approximate the current economic view on the rate of longterm inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium assumed trend rates for health care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans 

a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate would have the following effects 

 

 any arising health care claims costrelated experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculation of expected future claims once recognized experience gains and losses are amortized using a straightline method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants or over the average remaining lifetime of the remaining plan participants if the plan is viewed as “all or almost all” inactive participants 

financial statement impact 

in fiscal 2018 we recorded net defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plan expense of 23 million compared to 56 million of expense in fiscal 2017 and 163 million of expense in fiscal 2016 as of may 27 2018 we had cumulative unrecognized actuarial net losses of 18 billion on our defined benefit pension plans and cumulative unrecognized actuarial net gains of 40 million on our postretirement and postemployment benefit plans mainly as the result of liability increases from lower interest rates partially offset by recent increases in the values of plan assets these unrecognized actuarial net losses will result in increases in our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses because they currently exceed the corridors defined by gaap 

actual future net defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plan income or expense will depend on investment performance changes in future discount rates changes in health care cost trend rates and other factors related to the populations participating in these plans 

 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in august 2017 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new hedge accounting requirements the new standard amends the hedge accounting recognition and presentation requirements to better align an entity’s risk management activities and financial reporting the new standard also simplifies the application of hedge accounting guidance the requirements of the new standard are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2018 and interim periods within those annual periods which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2020 early adoption is permitted we are in the process of analyzing the impact of this standard on our results of operations and financial position 

in march 2017 the fasb issued new accounting requirements related to the presentation of net periodic defined benefit pension expense net periodic postretirement benefit expense and net periodic postemployment benefit expense the new standard requires the service cost component of net periodic benefit expense to be recorded in the same line items as other employee compensation costs within our consolidated statements of earnings other components of net periodic benefit expense must be presented separately outside of operating profit in our consolidated statements of earnings in addition the new standard requires that only the service cost component of net periodic benefit expense is eligible for capitalization we recognized net periodic benefit expense of 23 million in fiscal 2018 56 million in fiscal 2017 and 163 million in fiscal 2016 of which 123 million 141 million and 161 million respectively related to service cost these amounts may not necessarily be indicative of future amounts that may be recognized subsequent to the adoption of this new standard the new standard requires retrospective adoption of the presentation of net periodic benefit expense and prospective application of the capitalization of the service cost component the requirements of the new standard are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 and interim periods within those annual periods which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2019 

in february 2016 the fasb issued new accounting requirements for accounting presentation and classification of leases this will result in most leases being capitalized as a right of use asset with a related liability on our consolidated balance sheets the requirements of the new standard are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2018 and interim periods within those annual periods which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2020 we are in the process of implementing lease accounting software and analyzing the impact of this standard on our results of operations and financial position based on our assessment to date we expect this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets due to the amount of our lease commitments but we are unable to quantify the impact at this time 

in may 2014 the fasb issued new accounting requirements for the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers under the new guidance companies will apply a principlesbased five step model to recognize revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers and in an amount that reflects the consideration for which the company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods and services the requirements of the new standard and its subsequent amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 and interim periods within those annual periods which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2019 we will adopt these requirements using the cumulative effect approach we have evaluated and documented the impact of the guidance on our current accounting policies and practices and have not identified any material differences resulting from applying the new requirements to our revenue contracts additionally we did not identify any significant changes to our business processes systems and controls to support recognition and disclosure requirements under the new guidance this guidance will not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position

     forwardlooking financial measures 

our fiscal 2019 outlook for organic net sales growth and constantcurrency total segment operating profit and adjusted diluted eps are nongaap financial measures that exclude or have otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability including the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations restructuring charges and projectrelated costs acquisition integration costs and commodity marktomarket effects our fiscal 2019 outlook for organic net sales growth also excludes the effect of acquisitions and divestitures we are not able to reconcile these forwardlooking nongaap financial measures to their most directly comparable forwardlooking gaap financial measures without unreasonable efforts because we are unable to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the actual impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices or the timing of acquisitions divestitures and restructuring actions throughout fiscal 2019 the unavailable information could have a significant impact on our fiscal 2019 gaap financial results 

for fiscal 2019 we currently expect foreign currency exchange rates based on blend of forward and forecasted rates and hedge positions acquisitions and divestitures to increase net sales growth by high single digits foreign currency exchange rates to have an immaterial impact on adjusted operating profit and adjusted diluted eps growth and restructuring charges and projectrelated costs related to actions previously announced to total approximately 13 million

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates and commodity and equity prices changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows in the normal 

 

course of business we actively manage our exposure to these market risks by entering into various hedging transactions authorized under established policies that place clear controls on these activities the counterparties in these transactions are generally highly rated institutions we establish credit limits for each counterparty our hedging transactions include but are not limited to a variety of derivative financial instruments for information on interest rate foreign exchange commodity price and equity instrument risk please see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

value at risk 

the estimates in the table below are intended to measure the maximum potential fair value we could lose in one day from adverse changes in market interest rates foreign exchange rates commodity prices and equity prices under normal market conditions a monte carlo valueatrisk var methodology was used to quantify the market risk for our exposures the models assumed normal market conditions and used a 95 percent confidence level 

the var calculation used historical interest and foreign exchange rates and commodity and equity prices from the past year to estimate the potential volatility and correlation of these rates in the future the market data were drawn from the riskmetrics™ data set the calculations are not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that we expect to incur further since the hedging instrument the derivative inversely correlates with the underlying exposure we would expect that any loss or gain in the fair value of our derivatives would be generally offset by an increase or decrease in the fair value of the underlying exposure the positions included in the calculations were debt investments interest rate swaps foreign exchange forwards commodity swaps futures and options and equity instruments the calculations do not include the underlying foreign exchange and commodities or equityrelated positions that are offset by these marketrisksensitive instruments 

the table below presents the estimated maximum potential var arising from a oneday loss in fair value for our interest rate foreign currency commodity and equity marketrisksensitive instruments outstanding as of may 27 2018 and may 28 2017 and the average fair value impact during the year ended may 27 2018

competition the consumer foods industry is highly competitive with numerous manufacturers of varying sizes in the united states and throughout the world the food categories in which we participate also are very competitive our principal competitors in these categories all have substantial financial marketing and other resources competition in our product categories is based on product 

 

innovation product quality price brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing promotional activity and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences our principal strategies for competing in each of our segments include unique consumer insights effective customer relationships superior product quality innovative advertising product promotion product innovation aligned with consumers’ needs an efficient supply chain and price in most product categories we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products but also with regional brands and with generic and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices internationally we compete with both multinational and local manufacturers and each country includes a unique group of competitors

 item 1a risk factors tableend our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties any of the risks described below could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the food categories in which we participate are very competitive and if we are not able to compete effectively our results of operations could be adversely affected 

the food categories in which we participate are very competitive our principal competitors in these categories all have substantial financial marketing and other resources in most product categories we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products but also with regional brands and with generic and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices competition in our product categories is based on product innovation product quality price brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing promotional activity and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences if our large competitors were to seek an advantage through pricing or promotional changes we could choose to do the same which could adversely affect our margins and profitability if we did not do the same our revenues and market share could be adversely affected our market share and revenue growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing innovative products in response to changing consumer demands or by new product introductions of our competitors if we are unable to build and sustain brand equity by offering recognizably superior product quality we may be unable to maintain premium pricing over generic and private label products 

we may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face of a consolidating retail environment 

there has been significant consolidation in the grocery industry resulting in customers with increased purchasing power in addition large retail customers may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency lower pricing increased reliance on their own brand name products increased emphasis on generic and other economy brands and increased promotional programs if we are unable to use our scale marketing expertise product innovation knowledge of consumers’ needs and category leadership positions to respond to these demands our profitability and volume growth could be negatively impacted in addition the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could adversely affect our sales and profits in fiscal 2017 walmart accounted for 20 percent of our consolidated net sales and 29 percent of net sales of our north america retail segment for more information on significant customers please see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

 

price changes for the commodities we depend on for raw materials packaging and energy may adversely affect our profitability 

the principal raw materials that we use are commodities that experience price volatility caused by external conditions such as weather product scarcity limited sources of supply commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations commodity price changes may result in unexpected increases in raw material packaging and energy costs if we are unable to increase productivity to offset these increased costs or increase our prices we may experience reduced margins and profitability we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and the risk management procedures that we do use may not always work as we intend 

volatility in the market value of derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices will cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings 

we utilize derivatives to manage price risk for some of our principal ingredient and energy costs including grains oats wheat and corn oils principally soybean dairy products natural gas and diesel fuel changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded in earnings currently resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings these gains and losses are reported in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of earnings and in unallocated corporate items outside our segment operating results until we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating profit we also record our grain inventories at net realizable value we may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments 

if we are not efficient in our production our profitability could suffer as a result of the highly competitive environment in which we operate 

our future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to be efficient in the production and manufacture of our products in highly competitive markets gaining additional efficiencies may become more difficult over time our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or by eliminating redundant costs resulting from acquisitions or divestitures could adversely affect our profitability and weaken our competitive position many productivity initiatives involve complex reorganization of manufacturing facilities and production lines such manufacturing realignment may result in the interruption of production which may negatively impact product volume and margins we are currently pursuing several multiyear restructuring and cost savings initiatives designed to increase our efficiency and reduce expenses if we are unable to execute those initiatives as planned we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

disruption of our supply chain could adversely affect our business 

our ability to make move and sell products is critical to our success damage or disruption to raw material supplies or our manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather including any potential effects of climate change natural disaster fire terrorism cyberattack pandemic strikes importexport restrictions or other factors could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products many of our product lines are manufactured at a single location our suppliers’ policies and practices can damage our reputation and the quality and safety of our products failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or to effectively manage such events if they occur particularly when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location could adversely affect our business and results of operations as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain 

concerns with the safety and quality of food products could cause consumers to avoid certain food products or ingredients 

we could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients adverse publicity about these types of concerns whether or not valid may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions 

if our food products become adulterated misbranded or mislabeled we might need to recall those items and may experience product liability claims if consumers are injured 

we may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated misbranded or mislabeled a widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time we could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us a significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity damage to our reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in our food products which could have an adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands 

 

we may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and trends which may result in decreased demand for our products 

our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes eating habits and purchasing behaviors of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences in channels where they shop consumer preferences and categorylevel consumption may change from time to time and can be affected by a number of different trends and other factors if we fail to anticipate identify or react to these changes and trends such as adapting to emerging ecommerce channels or to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis we may experience reduced demand for our products which would in turn cause our revenues and profitability to suffer similarly demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns regarding the health effects of ingredients such as sodium trans fats genetically modified organisms sugar processed wheat or other product ingredients or attributes 

we may be unable to grow our market share or add products that are in faster growing and more profitable categories 

the food industry’s growth potential is constrained by population growth our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business faster than populations are growing in the markets that we serve one way to achieve that growth is to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new products in faster growing and more profitable categories our future results will also depend on our ability to increase market share in our existing product categories if we do not succeed in developing innovative products for new and existing categories our growth may slow which could adversely affect our profitability 

economic downturns could limit consumer demand for our products 

the willingness of consumers to purchase our products depends in part on local economic conditions in periods of economic uncertainty consumers may purchase more generic private label and other economy brands and may forego certain purchases altogether in those circumstances we could experience a reduction in sales of higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings in addition as a result of economic conditions or competitive actions we may be unable to raise our prices sufficiently to protect margins consumers may also reduce the amount of food that they consume away from home at customers that purchase products from our convenience stores  foodservice segment any of these events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

our results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands 

maintaining and continually enhancing the value of our many iconic brands is critical to the success of our business the value of our brands is based in large part on the degree to which consumers react and respond positively to these brands brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner adverse publicity about our products our failure to maintain the quality of our products the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences concerns about food safety or our products becoming unavailable to consumers consumer demand for our products may also be impacted by changes in the level of advertising or promotional support the growing use of social and digital media by consumers us and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared negative posts or comments about us our brands or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation if we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands our business results could be negatively impacted 

our international operations are subject to political and economic risks 

in fiscal 2017 29 percent of our consolidated net sales were generated outside of the united states we are accordingly subject to a number of risks relating to doing business internationally any of which could significantly harm our business these risks include 

 

      our financial performance on a us dollar denominated basis is subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates these fluctuations could cause material variations in our results of operations our principal exposures are to the australian dollar brazilian real british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese renminbi euro japanese yen mexican peso and swiss franc from time to time we enter into agreements that are intended to reduce the effects of our exposure to currency fluctuations but these agreements may not be effective in significantly reducing our exposure 

 

new regulations or regulatorybased claims could adversely affect our business 

our facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the united states department of agriculture the federal food and drug administration the occupational safety and health administration and other federal state local and foreign governmental agencies relating to the production packaging labelling storage distribution quality and safety of food products and the health and safety of our employees our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits administrative penalties and civil remedies including fines injunctions and recalls of our products we advertise our products and could be the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal state and foreign laws and regulations we may also be subject to new laws or regulations restricting our right to advertise our products including proposals to limit advertising to children changes in laws or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements on us could increase our cost of doing business or restrict our actions causing our results of operations to be adversely affected 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations our failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits administrative penalties and civil remedies we are currently party to a variety of environmental remediation obligations due to regulatory complexities uncertainties inherent in litigation and the risk of unidentified contaminants on current and former properties of ours the potential exists for remediation liability indemnification and compliance costs to differ from our estimates we cannot guarantee that our costs in relation to these matters or compliance with environmental laws in general will not exceed our established liabilities or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could limit financing and other options and in some cases adversely affect our ability to pay dividends 

as of may 28 2017 we had total debt redeemable interests and noncontrolling interests of 108 billion the agreements under which we have issued indebtedness do not prevent us from incurring additional unsecured indebtedness in the future our level of indebtedness may limit our 

 

  there are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments and noncontrolling interests if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the related indebtedness and other unrelated indebtedness could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity and our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing may also be adversely affected 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt and other obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control 

global capital and credit market issues could negatively affect our liquidity increase our costs of borrowing and disrupt the operations of our suppliers and customers 

we depend on stable liquid and wellfunctioning capital and credit markets to fund our operations although we believe that our operating cash flows financial assets access to capital and credit markets and revolving credit agreements will permit us to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future there can be no assurance that future volatility or disruption in the capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing we also utilize interest rate derivatives to reduce the volatility of our financing costs if we are not effective in hedging this volatility we may experience an increase in our costs of borrowing our business could also be negatively impacted if our suppliers or customers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy 

volatility in the securities markets interest rates and other factors could substantially increase our defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit costs 

we sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the united states canada and various foreign locations including defined benefit pension retiree health and welfare severance and other postemployment plans our major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments changes in interest rates mortality rates health care costs early retirement rates investment returns and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plans a significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations 

 

our business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or are breached 

information technology serves an important role in the efficient and effective operation of our business we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information to manage a variety of business processes and to comply with regulatory legal and tax requirements our information technology systems and infrastructure are critical to effectively manage our key business processes including digital marketing order entry and fulfillment supply chain management finance administration and other business processes these technologies enable internal and external communication among our locations employees suppliers customers and others and include the receipt and storage of personal information about our employees consumers and proprietary business information our information technology systems some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties may be vulnerable to damage interruption or shutdown due to any number of causes such as catastrophic events natural disasters fires power outages systems failures telecommunications failures security breaches computer viruses hackers employee error or malfeasance and other causes increased cybersecurity threats pose a potential risk to the security and viability of our information technology systems as well as the confidentiality integrity and availability of the data stored on those systems the failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and result in transaction errors processing inefficiencies data loss legal claims or proceedings regulatory penalties and the loss of sales and customers any interruption of our information technology systems could have operational reputational legal and financial impacts that may have a material adverse effect on our business 

a change in the assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses or a different weightedaverage cost of capital used to value our reporting units or our indefinitelived intangible assets could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth 

as of may 28 2017 we had 129 billion of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets goodwill for each of our reporting units is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred we compare the carrying value of the net assets of a reporting unit including goodwill to the fair value of the unit if the fair value of the net assets of the reporting unit is less than the net assets including goodwill impairment has occurred our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our longrange planning process we also make estimates of discount rates perpetuity growth assumptions market comparables and other factors our latin america and us yogurt reporting units have experienced declining business performance and we continue to monitor these businesses while we currently believe that our goodwill is not impaired different assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses could result in significant impairment losses 

we evaluate the useful lives of our intangible assets primarily intangible assets associated with the pillsbury  totino’s  progresso  yoplait  old el paso  yoki  häagendazs  and annie’s brands to determine if they are finite or indefinitelived reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry known technological advances legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 

our indefinitelived intangible assets are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable our estimate of the fair value of the brands is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs including projected revenues from our longrange plan assumed royalty rates which could be payable if we did not own the brands and a discount rate while not impaired as of may 28 2017 the immaculate baking progresso green giant and food should taste good brands had risk of decreasing coverage we will continue to monitor these businesses for further information on goodwill and intangible assets please refer to note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

our failure to successfully integrate acquisitions into our existing operations could adversely affect our financial results 

from time to time we evaluate potential acquisitions or joint ventures that would further our strategic objectives our success depends in part upon our ability to integrate acquired and existing operations if we are unable to successfully integrate acquisitions our financial results could suffer additional potential risks associated with acquisitions include additional debt leverage the loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business the assumption of unknown liabilities the inherent risk associated with entering a geographic area or line of business in which we have no or limited prior experience failure to achieve anticipated synergies and the impairment of goodwill or other acquisitionrelated intangible assets

we are a global consumer foods company we develop distinctive valueadded food products and market them under unique brand names we work continuously to improve our core products and to create new products that meet consumers’ evolving needs and preferences in addition we build the equity of our brands over time with strong consumerdirected marketing innovative new products and effective merchandising we believe our brandbuilding strategy is the key to winning and sustaining leading share positions in markets around the globe 

our fundamental financial goal is to generate superior returns for our shareholders over the long term we believe that increases in net sales segment operating profit earnings per share eps free cash flow cash return to shareholders and return on average total capital are key drivers of financial performance for our business 

our longterm growth objectives are to consistently deliver 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 we believe that this financial performance should result in longterm value creation for shareholders 

fiscal 2017 was a year of significant change for general mills we implemented a new global organizational structure to enhance our agility in a rapidly changing consumer environment we expanded our global supply chain restructuring initiative to further increase our efficiency we also implemented a business plan that aggressively shifted resources to our best growth opportunities and eliminated lowreturn investments and volume while these actions were the right thing to do for our company we did not execute up to our standards in certain areas and our results did not meet our expectations consolidated net sales and total segment operating profit growth fell short of our plans largely because of competitive price gaps in our north american retail segment we underestimated the impact that our aggressive reductions in promotional spending implemented early in the fiscal year would have on our net pricing relative to competitors the gaps were most pronounced in the us meals  baking operating unit and competitive activity also significantly impacted us yogurt we took corrective actions to improve our performance in the second half of fiscal 2017 but it was not sufficient to stem the early declines yogurt in the europe  australia segment also did not meet expectations as competitive pressure from smaller branded players increased significantly excluding yogurt the segment’s net sales and share increased driven by ice cream and snack bars innovation and improved merchandising performance in the convenience stores  foodservice segment segment operating profit grew driven by lower input costs and benefits from cost savings initiatives net sales for the focus 6 platforms grew modestly but were more than offset by market index pricing on flour in the asia  latin america segment macroeconomic weakness in latin america and the middle east created a challenging environment while greater china returned to net sales growth including contributions from the new yoplait business we continued to realize planned benefits from our numerous restructuring initiatives and cost reduction efforts in our supply chain and administrative areas which helped us to increase our adjusted operating profit margin and adjusted diluted earnings per share eps in fiscal 2017 

our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2017 declined 6 percent to 156 billion primarily driven by declining contributions from volume including the impact of the divestiture of the north american green giant product lines green giant on an organic basis net sales decreased 4 percent operating profit of 26 billion decreased 5 percent total segment operating profit of 30 billion declined 2 percent and declined 1 percent on a constantcurrency basis diluted eps of 277 was flat compared to fiscal 2016 adjusted diluted eps which excludes certain items affecting comparability of results rose 5 percent to 308 per share and increased 6 percent on a constantcurrency basis our return on average total capital was 127 percent and adjusted return on average total capital increased 30 basis points to 116 percent and increased 40 basis points on a constantcurrency basis see the “nongaap measures” section below for discussion of total segment operating profit adjusted diluted eps organic net sales growth rate constantcurrency total segment operating profit growth rate constantcurrency adjusted diluted eps growth rate and adjusted return on average total capital which are not defined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap

net cash provided by operations totaled 23 billion in fiscal 2017 at a conversion rate of 136 percent of net earnings including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests this cash generation supported capital investments totaling 684 million and our resulting free cash flow was 16 billion at a conversion rate of 86 percent of adjusted net earnings including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests we also returned significant cash to shareholders through a 6 percent dividend increase and share repurchases totaling 1652 million total cash returned to shareholders represented 164 percent of our free cash flow see the “nongaap measures” section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by gaap

we plan to continue to drive efficiency in fiscal 2018 including delivering approximately 390 million in supply chain productivity savings through our ongoing holistic margin management hmm efforts we also expect to deliver approximately 160 million in incremental savings from our other restructuring and costreduction initiatives which equates to approximately 700 million in savings versus fiscal 2015 levels these savings should more than offset our estimate of 3 percent input cost inflation 

this cost management discipline has helped us significantly expand our adjusted operating profit margin over the past two years we continue to see opportunities for further margin expansion including an increase in adjusted operating profit margin in fiscal 2018 but we will moderate the pace of expansion as we invest to restore topline growth looking forward we are focused on delivering a balance of sales growth and margin expansion along with strong cash conversion and cash returns to create toptier returns for our shareholders 

with these assumptions in mind

we have 605 million of longterm debt maturing in the next 12 months that is classified as current including 500 million of 14 percent notes due october 2017 and 100 million of 639 percent fixed rate medium term notes due for remarketing in february 2018 we believe that cash flows from operations together with available short and longterm debt financing will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for at least the next 12 months 

as of may 28 2017 our total debt including the impact of derivative instruments designated as hedges was 67 percent in fixedrate and 33 percent in floatingrate instruments compared to 78 percent in fixedrate and 22 percent in floatingrate instruments on may 29 2016 

return on average total capital was 127 percent in fiscal 2017 compared to 129 percent in fiscal 2016 improvement in adjusted return on average total capital is one of our key performance measures see the “nongaap measures” section below for our discussion of this measure which is not defined by gaap adjusted return on average total capital increased 30 basis points from 113 percent in fiscal 2016 to 116 percent in fiscal 2017 as fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings increased on a constantcurrency basis adjusted return on average total capital increased 40 basis points 

we also believe that our fixed charge coverage ratio and the ratio of operating cash flow to debt are important measures of our financial strength our fixed charge coverage ratio in fiscal 2017 was 726 compared to 740 in fiscal 2016 the measure decreased from fiscal 2016 as earnings before income taxes and aftertax earnings from joint ventures decreased by 132 million in fiscal 2017 our operating cash flow to debt ratio decreased 68 percentage points to 244 percent in fiscal 2017 driven by a decrease in cash provided by operations and an increase in notes payable 

we have a 51 percent controlling interest in yoplait sas and a 50 percent interest in yoplait marques snc and liberté marques sàrl sodiaal holds the remaining interests in each of these entities we consolidate these entities into our consolidated financial statements we record sodiaal’s 50 percent interest in yoplait marques snc and liberté marques sàrl as noncontrolling interests and its 49 percent interest in yoplait sas as a redeemable interest on our consolidated balance sheets these euro and canadian dollardenominated interests are reported in us dollars on our consolidated balance sheets sodiaal has the ability to put all or a portion of its redeemable interest to us at fair value once per year up to three times before december 2024 as of may 28 2017 the redemption value of the redeemable interest was 911 million which approximates its fair value 

the thirdparty holder of the general mills cereals llc gmc class a interests receives quarterly preferred distributions from available net income based on the application of a floating preferred return rate to the holder’s capital account balance established in the most recent marktomarket valuation currently 252 million on june 1 2015 the floating preferred return rate on gmc’s class a interests was reset to the sum of threemonth libor plus 125 basis points the preferred return rate is adjusted every three years through a negotiated agreement with the class a interest holder or through a remarketing auction 

we have an option to purchase the class a interests for consideration equal to the then current capital account value plus any unpaid preferred return and the prescribed makewhole amount if we purchase these interests any change in the thirdparty holder’s capital account from its original value will be charged directly to retained earnings and will increase or decrease the net earnings used to calculate eps in that period 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

as of may 28 2017 we have issued guarantees and comfort letters of 505 million for the debt and other obligations of consolidated subsidiaries and guarantees and comfort letters of 165 million for the debt and other obligations of nonconsolidated affiliates mainly cpw in addition offbalance sheet arrangements are generally limited to the future payments under noncancelable operating leases which totaled 501 million as of may 28 2017 

as of may 28 2017 we had invested in five variable interest entities vies none of our vies are material to our results of operations financial condition or liquidity as of and for the fiscal year ended may 28 2017 

our defined benefit plans in the united states are subject to the requirements of the pension protection act ppa in the future the ppa may require us to make additional contributions to our domestic plans we do not expect to be required to make any contributions in fiscal 2017 

the following table summarizes our future estimated cash payments under existing contractual obligations including payments due by period 

 

      

significant accounting estimates 

for a complete description of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report our significant accounting estimates are those that have a meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations these estimates include our accounting for promotional expenditures valuation of longlived assets intangible assets redeemable interest stockbased compensation income taxes and defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plans 

promotional expenditures 

our promotional activities are conducted through our customers and directly or indirectly with end consumers these activities include payments to customers to perform merchandising activities on our behalf such as advertising or instore displays discounts to our list prices to lower retail shelf prices payments to gain distribution of new products coupons contests and other incentives and media and advertising expenditures the recognition of these costs requires estimation of customer participation and performance levels these estimates are based on the forecasted customer sales the timing and forecasted costs of promotional activities and other factors differences between estimated expenses and actual costs are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period our accrued trade coupon and consumer marketing liabilities were 483 million as of may 28 2017 and 564 million as of may 29 2016 because our total promotional expenditures including amounts classified as a reduction of revenues are significant if our estimates are inaccurate we would have to make adjustments in subsequent periods that could have a significant effect on our results of operations 

valuation of longlived assets 

we estimate the useful lives of longlived assets and make estimates concerning undiscounted cash flows to review for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent appraisals as appropriate 

intangible assets 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are not subject to amortization and are tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred our estimates of fair value for goodwill impairment testing are determined based on a discounted cash flow model we use inputs from our longrange planning process to determine growth rates for sales and profits we also make estimates of discount rates perpetuity growth assumptions market comparables and other factors 

we evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets mainly brands to determine if they are finite or indefinitelived reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry known technological advances legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets intangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized on a straightline basis over their useful lives generally ranging from 4 to 30 years our estimate of the fair value of our brand assets is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs which include projected revenues from our longrange plan assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands and a discount rate 

as of may 28 2017 we had 129 billion of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets while we currently believe that the fair value of each intangible exceeds its carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses or a different weightedaverage cost of capital could result in material impairment losses and amortization expense we performed our fiscal 2017 assessment of our intangible assets as of august 29 2016 as of our annual assessment date there was no impairment of any of our intangible assets as their related fair values were substantially in excess of the carrying values except for the latin america reporting unit and the immaculate baking brand intangible asset the excess fair value above the carrying value of the latin america reporting unit and the immaculate baking brand intangible asset is as follows 

 

 our latin america reporting unit and immaculate baking brand have experienced declining business performance in addition while not impaired as of may 28 2017 the progresso  green giant  and food should taste good brand intangible assets and us yogurt reporting unit had risk of decreasing coverage we will continue to monitor these businesses for potential impairment 

 

redeemable interest 

in fiscal 2017 we adjusted the redemption value of sodiaal’s redeemable interest in yoplait sas based on a discounted cash flow model the significant assumptions used to estimate the redemption value include projected revenue growth and profitability from our longrange plan capital spending depreciation and taxes foreign currency exchange rates and a discount rate as of may 28 2017 the redemption value of the redeemable interest was 911 million 

stockbased compensation 

the valuation of stock options is a significant accounting estimate that requires us to use judgments and assumptions that are likely to have a material impact on our financial statements annually we make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility employee exercise behavior dividend yield and the forfeiture rate for more information on these assumptions please refer to note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

the estimated fair values of stock options granted and the assumptions used for the blackscholes optionpricing model were as follows 

 

 the riskfree interest rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based on the us treasury zerocoupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant an increase in the expected term by 1 year leaving all other assumptions constant would increase the grant date fair value by 1 percent if all other assumptions are held constant a one percentage point increase in our fiscal 2017 volatility assumption would increase the grant date fair value of our fiscal 2017 option awards by 7 percent 

to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our assumptions we are not required to true up grantdate fair valuebased expense to final intrinsic values however these differences can impact the classification of cash tax benefits realized upon exercise of stock options as explained in the following two paragraphs furthermore historical data has a significant bearing on our forwardlooking assumptions significant variances between actual and predicted experience could lead to prospective revisions in our assumptions which could then significantly impact the yearoveryear comparability of stockbased compensation expense 

any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings referred to as a windfall tax benefit is presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows as a financing cash flow the actual impact on future years’ cash flows will depend in part on the volume of employee stock option exercises during a particular year and the relationship between the exercisedate market value of the underlying stock and the original grantdate fair value previously determined for financial reporting purposes 

realized windfall tax benefits are credited to additional paidin capital within the consolidated balance sheets realized shortfall tax benefits amounts which are less than that previously recognized in earnings are first offset against the cumulative balance of windfall tax benefits if any and then charged directly to income tax expense potentially resulting in volatility in our consolidated effective income tax rate because employee stock option exercise behavior is not within our control it is possible that significantly different reported results could occur if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail 

see the new accounting requirements for the accounting and presentation of stockbased payments in the recently issued accounting pronouncements section below for forthcoming changes to stockbased compensation 

income taxes 

we apply a morelikelythannot threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions accordingly we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement future changes in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect earnings in the quarter of such change for more information on income taxes please refer to note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

 

defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plans 

we have defined benefit pension plans covering many employees in the united states canada france and the united kingdom we also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to many of our retirees in the united states canada and brazil under certain circumstances we also provide accruable benefits primarily severance to former and inactive employees in the united states canada and mexico please refer to note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for a description of our defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plans 

we recognize benefits provided during retirement or following employment over the plan participants’ active working lives accordingly we make various assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement of our obligations assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our net periodic benefit expense or income and accumulated benefit obligations include the longterm rates of return on plan assets the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our benefit plans and health care cost trend rates 

expected rate of return on plan assets 

our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation our historical longterm investment performance our estimate of future longterm returns by asset class using input from our actuaries investment services and investment managers and longterm inflation assumptions we review this assumption annually for each plan however our annual investment performance for one particular year does not by itself significantly influence our evaluation 

our historical investment returns compound annual growth rates for our united states defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets were 118 percent 100 percent 60 percent 84 percent and 84 percent for the 1 5 10 15 and 20 year periods ended may 31 2017 

on a weightedaverage basis the expected rate of return for all defined benefit plans was 817 percent for fiscal 2017 853 percent for fiscal 2016 and 853 percent for fiscal 2015 for fiscal 2018 we lowered our weightedaverage expected rate of return on plan assets for our principal defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in the united states to 795 percent due to asset changes that decreased investment risk in the portfolio 

lowering the expected longterm rate of return on assets by 100 basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense by 66 million for fiscal 2018 a marketrelated valuation basis is used to reduce yeartoyear expense volatility the marketrelated valuation recognizes certain investment gains or losses over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the marketrelated value of assets and the actual return based on the marketrelated value of assets our outside actuaries perform these calculations as part of our determination of annual expense or income 

discount rates 

beginning in fiscal 2017 we changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic benefit expense for our united states and most of our international defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plans we adopted a full yield curve approach to estimate service cost and interest cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows this method provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by correlating the timing of the plans’ liability cash flows to the corresponding rate on the yield curve previously we estimated service cost and interest cost using a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period this change does not affect the measurement of our benefit obligations related to these plans we have accounted for this change prospectively as a change in accounting estimate beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 the change in methodology resulted in a decrease in service and interest cost of approximately 68 million in fiscal 2017 compared to what our costs would have been under the previous method the fiscal 2017 reduction in our net periodic benefit expense as a result of this change in methodology was partially offset by a reduction in our weightedaverage expected rate of return on plan assets for our principal defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in the united states to 825 percent as a result of changes that decreased investment risk in the portfolio 

our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of may 31 for our defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plan obligations we work with our outside actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan participants and using the aa above median corporate bond yield to develop a forward interest rate curve including a margin to that index based on our credit risk this forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions 

 

our weightedaverage discount rates were as follows 

 

 lowering the discount rates by 100 basis points would increase our net defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plan expense for fiscal 2018 by approximately 85 million all obligationrelated experience gains and losses are amortized using a straightline method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants 

health care cost trend rates 

we review our health care cost trend rates annually our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims experience and information provided by our actuaries this information includes recent plan experience plan design overall industry experience and projections and assumptions used by other similar organizations our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with this review recent experiences and shortterm expectations our initial health care cost trend rate assumption is 73 percent for retirees age 65 and over and 70 percent for retirees under age 65 at the end of fiscal 2017 rates are graded down annually until the ultimate trend rate of 50 percent is reached in 2024 for all retirees the trend rates are applicable for calculations only if the retirees’ benefits increase as a result of health care inflation the ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually as necessary to approximate the current economic view on the rate of longterm inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium assumed trend rates for health care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans 

a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate would have the following effects 

 

 any arising health care claims costrelated experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculation of expected future claims once recognized experience gains and losses are amortized using a straightline method over 10 years resulting in at least the minimum amortization required being recorded 

financial statement impact 

in fiscal 2017 we recorded net defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plan expense of 56 million compared to 163 million of expense in fiscal 2016 and 153 million of expense in fiscal 2015 as of may 28 2017 we had cumulative unrecognized actuarial net losses of 16 billion on our defined benefit pension plans and 24 million on our postretirement and postemployment benefit plans mainly as the result of liability increases from lower interest rates partially offset by recent increases in the values of plan assets these unrecognized actuarial net losses will result in increases in our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses because they currently exceed the corridors defined by gaap 

actual future net defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plan income or expense will depend on investment performance changes in future discount rates changes in health care cost trend rates and other factors related to the populations participating in these plans 

 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in march 2017 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new accounting requirements related to the presentation of net periodic defined benefit pension expense net periodic postretirement benefit expense and net periodic postemployment benefit expense the new standard requires the service cost component of net periodic benefit expense to be recorded in the same line items as other employee compensation costs within our consolidated statements of earnings other components of net periodic benefit expense must be presented separately outside of operating profit in our consolidated statements of earnings in addition the new standard requires that only the service cost component of net periodic benefit expense is eligible for capitalization we recognized net periodic benefit expense of 56 million in fiscal 2017 163 million in fiscal 2016 and 153 million in fiscal 2015 of which 141 million 161 million and 167 million respectively related to service cost these amounts may not necessarily be indicative of future amounts that may be recognized subsequent to the adoption of this new standard the requirements of the new standard are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 and interim periods within those annual periods which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2019 early adoption is permitted 

in january 2017 the fasb issued new accounting requirements related to goodwill impairment testing the new standard eliminates the requirement to measure a goodwill impairment loss by determining the implied fair value of goodwill instead goodwill impairment losses will be measured by the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit the requirements of the new standard are effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2019 which for us is fiscal 2021 early adoption is permitted we intend to adopt this standard in fiscal 2018 and do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 

in october 2016 the fasb issued new accounting requirements related to the recognition of income taxes resulting from intraentity transfers of assets other than inventory this will result in the recognition of the income tax consequences resulting from the intraentity transfer of assets in our consolidated statements of earnings in the period of the transfer the requirements of the new standard are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 and interim periods within those annual periods which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2019 early adoption is permitted we are in the process of analyzing the impact of this standard on our results of operations and financial position 

in march 2016 the fasb issued new accounting requirements for the accounting and presentation of stockbased payments this will result in realized windfall and shortfall tax benefits upon exercise or vesting of stockbased awards being recorded in our consolidated statements of earnings instead of additional paidin capital within our consolidated balance sheets in addition realized windfall and shortfall tax benefits will be reclassified from financing activities to operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows we recognized windfall tax benefits of 64 million in fiscal 2017 94 million in fiscal 2016 and 75 million in fiscal 2015 these amounts may not necessarily be indicative of future amounts that may be recognized subsequent to the adoption of this new standard as windfall and shortfall tax benefits are dependent upon future stock prices employee exercise behavior and applicable tax rates the requirements of the new standard are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2018 

in february 2016 the fasb issued new accounting requirements for accounting presentation and classification of leases this will result in most leases being capitalized as a right of use asset with a related liability on our consolidated balance sheets the requirements of the new standard are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2018 and interim periods within those annual periods which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2020 we are in the process of evaluating lease accounting software and analyzing the impact of this standard on our results of operations and financial position based on our assessment to date we expect this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets due to the amount of our lease commitments but we are unable to quantify the impact at this time 

in may 2014 the fasb issued new accounting requirements for the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers the requirements of the new standard and its subsequent amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 and interim periods within those annual periods which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2019 we are in the process of documenting the impact of the guidance on our current accounting policies and practices in order to identify material differences if any that would result from applying the new requirements to our revenue contracts we continue to make progress on our revenue recognition review and are also in the process of evaluating the impact if any on changes to our business processes systems and controls to support recognition and disclosure requirements under the new guidance in addition we continue to assess our adoption approach based on our assessment to date we do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 

 

nongaap measures 

we have included in this report measures of financial performance that are not defined by gaap we believe that these measures provide useful information to investors and include these measures in other communications to investors 

for each of these nongaap financial measures we are providing below a reconciliation of the differences between the nongaap measure and the most directly comparable gaap measure an explanation of why we believe the nongaap measure provides useful information to investors and any additional purposes for which our management or board of directors uses the nongaap measure these nongaap measures should be viewed in addition to and not in lieu of the comparable gaap measure 

organic net sales growth rates 

this measure is used in reporting to our executive management and as a component of the board of directors’ measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes we provide organic net sales growth rates for our consolidated net sales and segment net sales we believe that organic net sales growth rates provide useful information to investors because they provide transparency to underlying performance in our net sales by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as acquisitions divestitures and a 53 rd week when applicable have on yeartoyear comparability a reconciliation of these measures to reported net sales growth rates the relevant gaap measures are included in our consolidated results of operations and results of segment operations discussions above 

total segment operating profit and total segment operating profit as a percent of net sales 

total segment operating profit is used in reporting to our executive management and as a component of the board of director’s measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes we believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is the profitability measure we use to evaluate segment performance 

 

  

diluted eps excluding certain items affecting comparability and related constantcurrency growth rate adjusted diluted eps 

this measure is used in reporting to our executive management and as a component of the board of directors’ measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes we believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is the profitability measure we use to evaluate earnings performance on a comparable yearoveryear basis the adjustments are either items resulting from infrequently occurring events or items that in management’s judgment significantly affect the yearoveryear assessment of operating results 

the reconciliation of our gaap measure diluted eps to diluted eps excluding certain items affecting comparability and the related constantcurrency growth rate follows 

 

       see our reconciliation below of the effective income tax rate as reported to the effective income tax rate excluding certain items affecting comparability for the tax impact of each item affecting comparability 

 

adjusted return on average total capital 

change in adjusted return on average total capital is a measure used in reporting to our executive management and as a component of the board of director’s measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes we believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is important for assessing the utilization of capital and it eliminates certain items that affect yeartoyear comparability the calculation of adjusted return on average total capital and return on average total capital its gaap equivalent follows 

 

     

free cash flow conversion rate and total cash returned to shareholders as a percentage of free cash flow 

we believe these measures provide useful information to investors because they are important for assessing our efficiency in converting earnings to cash and returning cash to shareholders the calculation of free cash flow conversion rate and net cash provided by operating activities conversion rate its equivalent gaap measure follows 

 

  

  

 

    see our reconciliation below of the effective income tax rate as reported to the effective income tax rate excluding certain items affecting comparability for the tax impact of each item affecting comparability

aftertax earnings from joint ventures growth rates on a constantcurrency basis are calculated as follows 

 

 net sales growth rates for canada operating unit on a constantcurrency basis 

we believe this measure of our canada operating unit net sales provides useful information to investors because it provides transparency to the underlying performance for the canada operating unit within our north america retail segment by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on yeartoyear comparability given volatility in foreign currency exchange markets 

net sales growth rates for our canada operating unit on a constantcurrency basis are calculated as follows 

 

  

constantcurrency segment operating profit growth rates 

we believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it provides transparency to underlying performance of our segments by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on yeartoyear comparability given volatility in foreign currency exchange markets 

our segments’ operating profit growth rates on a constantcurrency basis are calculated as follows 

 

  

effective income tax rate excluding certain items affecting comparability 

we believe this measure provides useful information to investors because it is important for assessing the effective tax rate excluding certain items affecting yeartoyear comparability and presents the income tax effects of certain items affecting comparability 

effective income tax rates excluding certain items affecting comparability are calculated as follows 

 

       

  

adjusted operating profit as a percent of net sales excluding certain items affecting comparability 

we believe this measure provides useful information to investors because it is important for assessing our operating profit margin on a comparable basis adjusted operating profit excludes certain items affecting comparability 

 

      forwardlooking financial measures 

our fiscal 2018 outlook for organic net sales growth constantcurrency total segment operating profit and adjusted diluted eps and adjusted operating profit margin are nongaap financial measures that exclude or have otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability including the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations restructuring charges and projectrelated costs and commodity marktomarket effects our fiscal 2018 outlook for organic net sales growth also excludes the effect of acquisitions and divestitures we are not able to reconcile these forwardlooking nongaap financial measures to their most directly comparable forwardlooking gaap financial measures without unreasonable efforts because we are unable to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the actual impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices or the timing of acquisitions divestitures and restructuring actions throughout fiscal 2018 the unavailable information could have a significant impact on our fiscal 2018 gaap financial results 

for fiscal 2018 we currently expect foreign currency exchange rates based on blend of forward and forecasted rates and hedge positions acquisitions and divestitures to have an immaterial impact on net sales growth foreign currency exchange rates to have an immaterial impact on total segment operating profit and adjusted diluted eps growth and total restructuring charges and projectrelated costs related to actions previously announced to total approximately 45 million

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates and commodity and equity prices changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows in the normal course of business we actively manage our exposure to these market risks by entering into various hedging transactions authorized under established policies that place clear controls on these activities the counterparties in these transactions are generally highly rated institutions we establish credit limits for each counterparty our hedging transactions include but are not limited to a variety of derivative financial instruments for information on interest rate foreign exchange commodity price and equity instrument risk please see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

value at risk 

the estimates in the table below are intended to measure the maximum potential fair value we could lose in one day from adverse changes in market interest rates foreign exchange rates commodity prices and equity prices under normal market conditions a monte carlo valueatrisk var methodology was used to quantify the market risk for our exposures the models assumed normal market conditions and used a 95 percent confidence level 

the var calculation used historical interest and foreign exchange rates and commodity and equity prices from the past year to estimate the potential volatility and correlation of these rates in the future the market data were drawn from the riskmetrics™ data set the calculations are not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that we expect to incur further since the hedging instrument the derivative inversely correlates with the underlying exposure we would expect that any loss or gain in the fair value of our derivatives would be generally offset by an increase or decrease in the fair value of the underlying exposure the positions included in the calculations were debt investments interest rate swaps foreign exchange forwards commodity swaps futures and options and equity instruments the calculations do not include the underlying foreign exchange and commodities or equityrelated positions that are offset by these marketrisksensitive instruments 

 

the table below presents the estimated maximum potential var arising from a oneday loss in fair value for our interest rate foreign currency commodity and equity marketrisksensitive instruments outstanding as of may 28 2017 and may 29 2016 and the average fair value impact during the year ended may 28 2017

competition the consumer foods industry is highly competitive with numerous manufacturers of varying sizes in the united states and throughout the world the food categories in which we participate also are very competitive our principal competitors in these categories all have substantial financial marketing and other resources competition in our product categories is based on product innovation product quality price brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing promotional activity and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences our principal strategies for competing in each of our segments include unique consumer insights effective customer relationships superior product quality innovative advertising product promotion product innovation aligned with consumers’ needs an efficient supply chain and price in most product categories we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products but also with regional brands and with generic and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices internationally we compete with both multinational and local manufacturers and each country includes a unique group of competitors

 item 1a risk factors tableend our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties any of the risks described below could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

the food categories in which we participate are very competitive and if we are not able to compete effectively our results of operations could be adversely affected 

the food categories in which we participate are very competitive our principal competitors in these categories all have substantial financial marketing and other resources in most product categories we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products but also with regional brands and with generic and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices competition in our product categories is based on product innovation product quality price brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing promotional activity and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences if our large competitors were to seek an advantage through pricing or promotional changes we could choose to do the same which could adversely affect our margins and profitability if we did not do the same our revenues and market share could be adversely affected our market share and revenue growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing innovative products in response to changing consumer demands or by new product introductions of our competitors if we are unable to build and sustain brand equity by offering recognizably superior product quality we may be unable to maintain premium pricing over generic and private label products 

we may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face of a consolidating retail environment 

there has been significant consolidation in the grocery industry resulting in customers with increased purchasing power in addition large retail customers may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency lower pricing increased reliance on their own brand name products increased emphasis on generic and other economy brands and increased promotional programs if we are unable to use our scale marketing expertise product innovation knowledge of consumers’ needs and category leadership positions to respond to these demands our profitability and volume growth could be negatively impacted in addition the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could adversely affect our sales and profits in fiscal 2016 walmart accounted for 20 percent of our consolidated net sales and 30 percent of net sales of our us retail segment for more information on significant customers please see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

price changes for the commodities we depend on for raw materials packaging and energy may adversely affect our profitability 

the principal raw materials that we use are commodities that experience price volatility caused by external conditions such as weather product scarcity limited sources of supply commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations commodity price changes may result in unexpected increases in raw material packaging and energy costs if we are unable to increase productivity to offset these increased costs or increase our prices we may experience reduced margins and profitability we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and the risk management procedures that we do use may not always work as we intend 

volatility in the market value of derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices will cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings 

we utilize derivatives to manage price risk for some of our principal ingredient and energy costs including grains oats wheat and corn oils principally soybean dairy products natural gas and diesel fuel changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded in earnings currently resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings these gains and losses are reported in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of earnings and in unallocated corporate items outside our segment operating results until we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating profit we also record our grain inventories at fair value we may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments 

 

if we are not efficient in our production our profitability could suffer as a result of the highly competitive environment in which we operate 

our future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to be efficient in the production and manufacture of our products in highly competitive markets gaining additional efficiencies may become more difficult over time our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or by eliminating redundant costs resulting from acquisitions or divestitures could adversely affect our profitability and weaken our competitive position many productivity initiatives involve complex reorganization of manufacturing facilities and production lines such manufacturing realignment may result in the interruption of production which may negatively impact product volume and margins we are currently pursuing several multiyear restructuring and cost savings initiatives designed to increase our efficiency and reduce expenses if we are unable to execute those initiatives as planned we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

disruption of our supply chain could adversely affect our business 

our ability to make move and sell products is critical to our success damage or disruption to raw material supplies or our manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather including any potential effects of climate change natural disaster fire terrorism cyberattack pandemic strikes import restrictions or other factors could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products our suppliers’ policies and practices can damage our reputation and the quality and safety of our products failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or to effectively manage such events if they occur particularly when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location could adversely affect our business and results of operations as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain 

concerns with the safety and quality of food products could cause consumers to avoid certain food products or ingredients 

we could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients adverse publicity about these types of concerns whether or not valid may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions 

if our food products become adulterated misbranded or mislabeled we might need to recall those items and may experience product liability claims if consumers are injured 

we may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated misbranded or mislabeled a widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time we could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us a significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity damage to our reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in our food products which could have an adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands 

we may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and trends which may result in decreased demand for our products 

our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes and eating habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences consumer preferences and categorylevel consumption may change from time to time and can be affected by a number of different trends and other factors if we fail to anticipate identify or react to these changes and trends or to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis we may experience reduced demand for our products which would in turn cause our revenues and profitability to suffer similarly demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns regarding the health effects of ingredients such as sodium trans fats genetically modified organisms sugar processed wheat or other product ingredients or attributes 

we may be unable to grow our market share or add products that are in faster growing and more profitable categories 

the food industry’s growth potential is constrained by population growth our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business faster than populations are growing in the markets that we serve one way to achieve that growth is to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new products in faster growing and more profitable categories our future results will also depend on our ability to increase market share in our existing product categories if we do not succeed in developing innovative products for new and existing categories our growth may slow which could adversely affect our profitability 

 

economic downturns could limit consumer demand for our products 

the willingness of consumers to purchase our products depends in part on local economic conditions in periods of economic uncertainty consumers may purchase more generic private label and other economy brands and may forego certain purchases altogether in those circumstances we could experience a reduction in sales of higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings in addition as a result of economic conditions or competitive actions we may be unable to raise our prices sufficiently to protect margins consumers may also reduce the amount of food that they consume away from home at customers that purchase products from our convenience stores and foodservice segment any of these events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

our results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands 

maintaining and continually enhancing the value of our many iconic brands is critical to the success of our business the value of our brands is based in large part on the degree to which consumers react and respond positively to these brands brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner adverse publicity about our products our failure to maintain the quality of our products the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences concerns about food safety or our products becoming unavailable to consumers consumer demand for our products may also be impacted by changes in the level of advertising or promotional support the growing use of social and digital media by consumers us and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared negative posts or comments about us our brands or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation if we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands our business results could be negatively impacted 

our international operations are subject to political and economic risks 

in fiscal 2016 28 percent of our consolidated net sales were generated outside of the united states we are accordingly subject to a number of risks relating to doing business internationally any of which could significantly harm our business these risks include 

 

      our financial performance on a us dollar denominated basis is subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates these fluctuations could cause material variations in our results of operations our principal exposures are to the australian dollar brazilian real british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese renminbi euro japanese yen mexican peso and swiss franc from time to time we enter into agreements that are intended to reduce the effects of our exposure to currency fluctuations but these agreements may not be effective in significantly reducing our exposure 

new regulations or regulatorybased claims could adversely affect our business 

our facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the united states department of agriculture the federal food and drug administration the occupational safety and health administration and other federal state local and foreign governmental agencies relating to the production packaging labelling storage distribution quality and safety of food products and the health and safety of our employees our failure to 

 

comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits administrative penalties and civil remedies including fines injunctions and recalls of our products we advertise our products and could be the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal state and foreign laws and regulations we may also be subject to new laws or regulations restricting our right to advertise our products including proposals to limit advertising to children changes in laws or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements on us could increase our cost of doing business or restrict our actions causing our results of operations to be adversely affected 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations our failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits administrative penalties and civil remedies we are currently party to a variety of environmental remediation obligations due to regulatory complexities uncertainties inherent in litigation and the risk of unidentified contaminants on current and former properties of ours the potential exists for remediation liability indemnification and compliance costs to differ from our estimates we cannot guarantee that our costs in relation to these matters or compliance with environmental laws in general will not exceed our established liabilities or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could limit financing and other options and in some cases adversely affect our ability to pay dividends 

as of may 29 2016 we had total debt redeemable interests and noncontrolling interests of 96 billion the agreements under which we have issued indebtedness do not prevent us from incurring additional unsecured indebtedness in the future our level of indebtedness may limit our 

 

  there are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments and noncontrolling interests if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the related indebtedness and other unrelated indebtedness could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity and our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing may also be adversely affected 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt and other obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control 

global capital and credit market issues could negatively affect our liquidity increase our costs of borrowing and disrupt the operations of our suppliers and customers 

we depend on stable liquid and wellfunctioning capital and credit markets to fund our operations although we believe that our operating cash flows financial assets access to capital and credit markets and revolving credit agreements will permit us to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future there can be no assurance that future volatility or disruption in the capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing we also utilize interest rate derivatives to reduce the volatility of our financing costs if we are not effective in hedging this volatility we may experience an increase in our costs of borrowing our business could also be negatively impacted if our suppliers or customers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy 

volatility in the securities markets interest rates and other factors could substantially increase our defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit costs 

we sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the united states canada and various foreign locations including defined benefit pension retiree health and welfare severance and other postemployment plans our major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of 

 

securities and other investments changes in interest rates mortality rates health care costs early retirement rates investment returns and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plans a significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations 

our business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or are breached 

information technology serves an important role in the efficient and effective operation of our business we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information to manage a variety of business processes and to comply with regulatory legal and tax requirements our information technology systems and infrastructure are critical to effectively manage our key business processes including digital marketing order entry and fulfillment supply chain management finance administration and other business processes these technologies enable internal and external communication among our locations employees suppliers customers and others and include the receipt and storage of personal information about our employees consumers and proprietary business information our information technology systems some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties may be vulnerable to damage interruption or shutdown due to any number of causes such as catastrophic events natural disasters fires power outages systems failures telecommunications failures security breaches computer viruses hackers employee error or malfeasance and other causes increased cybersecurity threats pose a potential risk to the security and viability of our information technology systems as well as the confidentiality integrity and availability of the data stored on those systems the failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and result in transaction errors processing inefficiencies data loss legal claims or proceedings regulatory penalties and the loss of sales and customers any interruption of our information technology systems could have operational reputational legal and financial impacts that may have a material adverse effect on our business 

a change in the assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses or a different weightedaverage cost of capital used to value our reporting units or our indefinitelived intangible assets could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth 

as of may 29 2016 we had 129 billion of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets goodwill for each of our reporting units is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred we compare the carrying value of the net assets of a reporting unit including goodwill to the fair value of the unit if the fair value of the net assets of the reporting unit is less than the net assets including goodwill impairment has occurred our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our longrange planning process we also make estimates of discount rates perpetuity growth assumptions market comparables and other factors while we currently believe that our goodwill is not impaired different assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses could result in significant impairment losses 

we evaluate the useful lives of our intangible assets primarily intangible assets associated with the pillsbury  totino’s  progresso  yoplait  old el paso  yoki  häagendazs  and annie’s brands to determine if they are finite or indefinitelived reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry known technological advances legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 

our indefinitelived intangible assets are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable our estimate of the fair value of the brands is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs including projected revenues from our longrange plan assumed royalty rates which could be payable if we did not own the brands and a discount rate our uncle toby’s and mountain high brands have experienced declining business performance our strategies for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018 will focus our growth investments on our brands and platforms with the strongest profitable growth potential as a result certain parts of our us retail segment could experience reduced future sales projections we 

 

performed a sensitivity analysis for certain brand intangible assets and determined that while not impaired as of may 29 2016 the progresso and food should taste good brands had risk of decreasing coverage we will continue to monitor these businesses for further information on goodwill and intangible assets please refer to note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

our failure to successfully integrate acquisitions into our existing operations could adversely affect our financial results 

from time to time we evaluate potential acquisitions or joint ventures that would further our strategic objectives our success depends in part upon our ability to integrate acquired and existing operations if we are unable to successfully integrate acquisitions our financial results could suffer additional potential risks associated with acquisitions include additional debt leverage the loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business the assumption of unknown liabilities the inherent risk associated with entering a geographic area or line of business in which we have no or limited prior experience failure to achieve anticipated synergies and the impairment of goodwill or other acquisitionrelated intangible assets

 we believe that this financial performance should result in longterm value creation for shareholders 

fiscal 2016 was an important step toward returning to our longterm growth objectives our us retail segment improved its operating profit performance in fiscal 2016 excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures primarily the north american green giant business green giant divestiture and 6 incremental months of results from the acquisition of annie’s inc annie’s net sales as reported declined 5 percentage points in fiscal 2016 which included 2 percentage points of decline from the net impact of green giant and annie’s and 1 percentage point of decline from a 53 rd week in fiscal 2015 while net sales growth did not meet our expectations operating profit increased 1 percent despite the 53 rd week in fiscal 2015 and the net unfavorable impact of the green giant divestiture and annie’s acquisition operating profit for the convenience stores and foodservice segment increased 7 percent driven primarily by our 6 priority product platforms operating results for the international segment had good growth in developed markets that was tempered by slowdowns in developing markets international net sales as reported declined 10 percent including 1 percentage point of decline from the divestiture of green giant our venezuela business and our foodservice business in argentina but grew 3 percent on a constantcurrency basis international segment operating profit declined 15 percent and was impacted by 12 percentage points of unfavorable foreign currency exchange and slowing economic growth in china and brazil as well as the effect of divestitures

104 percent of adjusted net earnings including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests we also returned significant cash to shareholders through a 7 percent dividend increase and share repurchases totaling 607 million total cash returned to shareholders represented 79 percent of our free cash flow see the “nongaap measures” section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by gaap 

we recorded the following achievements related to our other key operating objectives for fiscal 2016 

 

  

 a detailed review of our fiscal 2016 performance appears below in the section titled “fiscal 2016 consolidated results of operations” 

with strong savings in fiscal 2016 and visibility to further savings over the next two years we now expect our previously announced organizational restructuring and costreduction initiatives including projects century catalyst and compass as well as administrative cost reductions to generate total annual savings of 600 million by fiscal 2018 we are also undertaking further efforts to prioritize investments reduce complexity and streamline our operations to drive profitable sales growth as a result we are increasing and accelerating our adjusted operating profit margin expansion target we expect to achieve an adjusted operating profit margin of 20 percent by fiscal 2018 an increase of 400 basis points over fiscal 2015 levels key drivers of margin expansion over the next two years will include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 we will focus our fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018 growth investments on our brands and platforms with the strongest profitable growth potential including 

 

  

  

 net sales for these “growth” businesses which comprise 75 percent of total company net sales and a similar proportion of operating profit are expected to grow at a low singledigit organic rate in fiscal 2017 in our “foundation” businesses which comprise the remainder of the portfolio we will only pursue selective growth investments and will focus on reducing sku complexity optimizing commercial investments and prioritizing profitable volume while making selective consumer first investments we expect organic net sales to decline mid singledigits for these businesses in fiscal 2017 with this focused approach we expect 

 

  

  

 our fiscal 2017 plans call for continued strong cash returns to shareholders the current annualized dividend rate of 192 per share is up 8 percent from the annual dividend paid in fiscal 2016 share repurchases in fiscal 2017 are expected to result in a net reduction in average diluted shares outstanding of approximately 1 to 2 percent

for fiscal 2016 unallocated corporate expense totaled 289 million compared to 414 million last year in fiscal 2016 we recorded a 63 million net decrease in expense related to marktomarket valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories compared to a 90 million net increase in expense in the prior year in addition we recorded 78 million of restructuring charges and 58 million of restructuring initiative projectrelated costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2016 compared to 60 million of restructuring charges and 13 million of restructuring initiative projectrelated costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2015 we recorded an 8 million foreign exchange loss related to the remeasurement of assets and liabilities of our venezuelan subsidiary in fiscal 2015 we also recorded 16 million of integration costs resulting from the acquisition of annie’s in fiscal 2015 the decrease in unallocated corporate expense also reflects cost savings from project catalyst and other cost management initiatives 

for fiscal 2015 unallocated corporate expense totaled 414 million compared to 258 million in fiscal 2014 in fiscal 2015 we recorded a 90 million net increase in expense related to marktomarket valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories compared to a 49 million net decrease in fiscal 2014 in addition we recorded 60 million of restructuring charges and 13 million of restructuring initiative projectrelated costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2015 in fiscal 2015 we recorded an 8 million foreign exchange loss related to the remeasurement of assets and liabilities of our venezuelan subsidiary compared to 62 million in fiscal 2014 we also recorded 16 million of integration costs resulting from the acquisition of annie’s in fiscal 2015 

venezuela is a highly inflationary economy and as such we remeasured the value of the assets and liabilities of our former venezuelan subsidiary based on the exchange rate at which we expected to remit dividends in us dollars from the simadi market in fiscal 2015 we recorded an 8 million foreign currency exchange loss related to remeasurement in fiscal 2016 we sold our general mills de venezuela ca subsidiary to a third party and exited our business in venezuela as a result of this transaction we recorded a loss on the sale of 38 million pretax 

 

in fiscal 2015 we changed how we assess segment operating performance to exclude the asset and liability remeasurement impact from hyperinflationary economies this impact is now included in unallocated corporate items all periods presented have been changed to conform to this presentation 

impact of inflation 

our gross margin performance in fiscal 2016 reflects the impact of 2 percent input cost inflation primarily on commodity inputs we expect input cost inflation of 2 percent in fiscal 2017 we attempt to minimize the effects of inflation through hmm planning and operating practices our risk management practices are discussed in item 7a of this report 

liquidity 

the primary source of our liquidity is cash flow from operations over the most recent threeyear period our operations have generated 77 billion in cash a substantial portion of this operating cash flow has been returned to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends we also use cash from operations to fund our capital expenditures and acquisitions we typically use a combination of cash notes payable and longterm debt to finance significant acquisitions and major capital expansions 

as of may 29 2016 we had 645 million of cash and cash equivalents held in foreign jurisdictions which will be used to fund foreign operations and acquisitions there is currently no need to repatriate these funds in order to meet domestic funding obligations or scheduled cash distributions if we choose to repatriate historical earnings held in foreign jurisdictions we intend to do so only in a taxneutral manner 

cash flows from operations 

 

 in fiscal 2016 our operations generated 26 billion of cash compared to 25 billion in fiscal 2015 the 477 million increase in net earnings included a 96 million change in deferred income taxes and a 148 million net gain on divestitures and was also offset by a 424 million decrease in noncash restructuring charges the 43 million change in current assets and liabilities was primarily driven by the timing of accounts payable including the impact of longer terms offset by the timing of inventory build 

we strive to grow core working capital at or below the rate of growth in our net sales for fiscal 2016 core working capital decreased 41 percent primarily due to an increase in accounts payable largely driven by longer payables terms and a decrease in inventory compared to a net sales decline of 6 percent in fiscal 2015 core working capital decreased 13 percent compared to a net sales decline of 2 percent and in fiscal 2014 core working capital decreased 9 percent compared to net sales growth of 1 percent 

 

in fiscal 2015 our operations generated 25 billion of cash flat compared to fiscal 2014 the 247 million change in current assets and liabilities was primarily driven by the timing of trade and promotion accruals changes in tax accruals and changes in derivative positions this was largely offset by lower net earnings which included a 260 million noncash impairment charge 271 million of noncash restructuring charges and a 147 million change in net deferred income taxes 

cash flows from investing activities 

 

 in fiscal 2016 we generated 93 million of cash through investing activities compared to a use of 16 billion in fiscal 2015 we invested 729 million in land buildings and equipment in fiscal 2016 17 million more than last year in fiscal 2016 we received proceeds of 828 million from the divestitures of certain businesses primarily green giant in fiscal 2015 we acquired annie’s for an aggregate purchase price of 809 million net of 12 million of cash acquired 

in fiscal 2015 cash used by investing activities increased by 10 billion from fiscal 2014 we invested 712 million in land buildings and equipment in fiscal 2015 49 million more than in fiscal 2014 in fiscal 2015 we acquired annie’s we made 102 million of investments in affiliates primarily cpw in fiscal 2015 in fiscal 2014 we sold certain grain elevators for 124 million in cash 

we expect capital expenditures to be approximately 734 million in fiscal 2017 these expenditures will fund initiatives that are expected to fuel international growth support innovative products and continue hmm initiatives throughout the supply chain 

 

cash flows from financing activities 

 

 net cash used by financing activities increased by 901 million in fiscal 2016 we had 14 billion less net debt issuances in fiscal 2016 than the prior year for more information on our debt issuances and payments please refer to note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

during fiscal 2016 we received 172 million in proceeds from common stock issued on exercised options compared to 164 million in fiscal 2015 an increase of 8 million during fiscal 2014 we received 108 million in proceeds from common stock issued on exercised options 

in may 2014 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 100 million shares of our common stock purchases under the authorization can be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions including the use of call options and other derivative instruments rule 10b51 trading plans and accelerated repurchase programs the authorization has no specified termination date 

during fiscal 2016 we repurchased 11 million shares of our common stock for 607 million during fiscal 2015 we repurchased 22 million shares of our common stock for 1162 million during fiscal 2014 we repurchased 36 million shares of our common stock for 1745 million 

dividends paid in fiscal 2016 totaled 1072 million or 178 per share a 7 percent per share increase from fiscal 2015 dividends paid in fiscal 2015 totaled 1018 million or 167 per share an 8 percent per share increase from fiscal 2014 dividends of 155 per share 

selected cash flows from joint ventures 

selected cash flows from our joint ventures are set forth in the following table 

 

  

capital resources 

total capital consisted of the following 

 

 the following table details the feepaid committed and uncommitted credit lines we had available as of may 29 2016 

 

 in may 2016 we entered into a 27 billion feepaid committed credit facility that is scheduled to expire in may 2021 concurrent with the execution of this credit facility we terminated our 17 billion and 10 billion credit facilities 

in june 2014 our subsidiary yoplait sas entered into a €2000 million feepaid committed credit facility that is scheduled to expire in june 2019 

to ensure availability of funds we maintain bank credit lines sufficient to cover our outstanding notes payable commercial paper is a continuing source of shortterm financing we have commercial paper programs available to us in the united states and europe we also have uncommitted and assetbacked credit lines that support our foreign operations the credit facilities contain several covenants including a requirement to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 25 times 

certain of our longterm debt agreements our credit facilities and our noncontrolling interests contain restrictive covenants as of may 29 2016 we were in compliance with all of these covenants 

we have 1103 million of longterm debt maturing in the next 12 months that is classified as current including 1000 million of 57 percent fixed rate notes due february 2017 we believe that cash flows from operations together with available short and longterm debt financing will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for at least the next 12 months 

as of may 29 2016 our total debt including the impact of derivative instruments designated as hedges was 78 percent in fixedrate and 22 percent in floatingrate instruments compared to 72 percent in fixedrate and 28 percent in floatingrate instruments on may 31 2015 

 

return on average total capital was 129 percent in fiscal 2016 compared to 91 percent in fiscal 2015 improvement in return on adjusted average total capital is one of our key performance measures see the “nongaap measures” section below for our discussion of this measure which is not defined by gaap adjusted return on average total capital increased 10 basis points from 112 percent in fiscal 2015 to 113 percent in fiscal 2016 as fiscal 2016 earnings increased on a constantcurrency basis adjusted return on average total capital increased 40 basis points 

we also believe that our fixed charge coverage ratio and the ratio of operating cash flow to debt are important measures of our financial strength our fixed charge coverage ratio in fiscal 2016 was 740 compared to 554 in fiscal 2015 the measure increased from fiscal 2015 as earnings before income taxes and aftertax earnings from joint ventures increased by 642 million in fiscal 2016 our operating cash flow to debt ratio increased 35 percentage points to 312 percent in fiscal 2016 driven by a decrease in total debt 

we have a 51 percent controlling interest in yoplait sas and a 50 percent interest in yoplait marques snc and liberté marques sàrl sodiaal holds the remaining interests in each of these entities we consolidate these entities into our consolidated financial statements we record sodiaal’s 50 percent interest in yoplait marques snc and liberté marques sàrl as noncontrolling interests and its 49 percent interest in yoplait sas as a redeemable interest on our consolidated balance sheets these euro and canadian dollardenominated interests are reported in us dollars on our consolidated balance sheets sodiaal has the ability to put all or a portion of its redeemable interest to us at fair value once per year up to three times before december 2024 as of may 29 2016 the redemption value of the redeemable interest was 846 million which approximates its fair value 

the thirdparty holder of the general mills cereals llc gmc class a interests receives quarterly preferred distributions from available net income based on the application of a floating preferred return rate to the holder’s capital account balance established in the most recent marktomarket valuation currently 252 million on june 1 2015 the floating preferred return rate on gmc’s class a interests was reset to the sum of threemonth libor plus 125 basis points the preferred return rate is adjusted every three years through a negotiated agreement with the class a interest holder or through a remarketing auction 

we have an option to purchase the class a interests for consideration equal to the then current capital account value plus any unpaid preferred return and the prescribed makewhole amount if we purchase these interests any change in the thirdparty holder’s capital account from its original value will be charged directly to retained earnings and will increase or decrease the net earnings used to calculate eps in that period 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

as of may 29 2016 we have issued guarantees and comfort letters of 383 million for the debt and other obligations of consolidated subsidiaries and guarantees and comfort letters of 239 million for the debt and other obligations of nonconsolidated affiliates mainly cpw in addition offbalance sheet arrangements are generally limited to the future payments under noncancelable operating leases which totaled 398 million as of may 29 2016 

as of may 29 2016 we had invested in five variable interest entities vies none of our vies are material to our results of operations financial condition or liquidity as of and for the fiscal year ended may 29 2016 

our defined benefit plans in the united states are subject to the requirements of the pension protection act ppa in the future the ppa may require us to make additional contributions to our domestic plans we do not expect to be required to make any contributions in fiscal 2017 

 

the following table summarizes our future estimated cash payments under existing contractual obligations including payments due by period 

 

     significant accounting estimates 

for a complete description of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report our significant accounting estimates are those that have a meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations these estimates include our accounting for promotional expenditures valuation of longlived assets intangible assets redeemable interest stockbased compensation income taxes and defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plans 

promotional expenditures 

our promotional activities are conducted through our customers and directly or indirectly with end consumers these activities include payments to customers to perform merchandising activities on our behalf such as advertising or instore displays discounts to our list prices to lower retail shelf prices payments to gain distribution of new products coupons contests and other incentives and media and advertising expenditures the recognition of these costs requires estimation of customer participation and performance levels these estimates are based on the forecasted customer sales the timing and forecasted costs of promotional activities and other factors differences between estimated expenses and actual costs are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period our accrued trade coupon and consumer marketing liabilities were 564 million as of may 29 2016 and 565 million as of may 31 2015 because our total promotional expenditures including amounts classified as a reduction of revenues are significant if our estimates are inaccurate we would have to make adjustments in subsequent periods that could have a significant effect on our results of operations 

 

valuation of longlived assets 

we estimate the useful lives of longlived assets and make estimates concerning undiscounted cash flows to review for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent appraisals as appropriate 

intangible assets 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are not subject to amortization and are tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred our estimates of fair value for goodwill impairment testing are determined based on a discounted cash flow model we use inputs from our longrange planning process to determine growth rates for sales and profits we also make estimates of discount rates perpetuity growth assumptions market comparables and other factors 

we evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets mainly brands to determine if they are finite or indefinitelived reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry known technological advances legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets intangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized on a straightline basis over their useful lives generally ranging from 4 to 30 years our estimate of the fair value of our brand assets is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs which include projected revenues from our longrange plan assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands and a discount rate 

as of may 29 2016 we had 129 billion of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets while we currently believe that the fair value of each intangible exceeds its carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses or a different weightedaverage cost of capital could result in material impairment losses and amortization expense we performed our fiscal 2016 assessment of our intangible assets as of august 31 2015 as of our annual assessment date there was no impairment of any of our intangible assets as their related fair values were substantially in excess of the carrying values except for the mountain high and uncle toby’s brands the excess fair value above the carrying value of these brand assets were as follows 

 

 our mountain high and uncle toby’s brands have experienced declining business performance and we will continue to monitor these businesses 

our strategies for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018 will focus our growth investments on our brands and platforms with the strongest profitable growth potential as a result certain parts of our us retail segment could experience reduced future sales projections we performed a sensitivity analysis for certain brand intangible assets and determined that while not impaired as of may 29 2016 the progresso and food should taste good brands had risk of decreasing coverage we will continue to monitor these businesses 

redeemable interest 

in fiscal 2016 we adjusted the redemption value of sodiaal’s redeemable interest in yoplait sas based on a discounted cash flow model the significant assumptions used to estimate the redemption value include projected revenue growth and profitability from our longrange plan capital spending depreciation and taxes foreign currency exchange rates and a discount rate as of may 29 2016 the redemption value of the redeemable interest was 846 million 

 

stockbased compensation 

the valuation of stock options is a significant accounting estimate that requires us to use judgments and assumptions that are likely to have a material impact on our financial statements annually we make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility employee exercise behavior dividend yield and the forfeiture rate for more information on these assumptions please refer to note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

the estimated fair values of stock options granted and the assumptions used for the blackscholes optionpricing model were as follows 

 

 the riskfree interest rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based on the us treasury zerocoupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant an increase in the expected term by 1 year leaving all other assumptions constant would increase the grant date fair value by less than 1 percent if all other assumptions are held constant a one percentage point increase in our fiscal 2016 volatility assumption would increase the grant date fair value of our fiscal 2016 option awards by 7 percent 

to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our assumptions we are not required to true up grantdate fair valuebased expense to final intrinsic values however these differences can impact the classification of cash tax benefits realized upon exercise of stock options as explained in the following two paragraphs furthermore historical data has a significant bearing on our forwardlooking assumptions significant variances between actual and predicted experience could lead to prospective revisions in our assumptions which could then significantly impact the yearoveryear comparability of stockbased compensation expense 

any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings referred to as a windfall tax benefit is presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows as a financing cash flow the actual impact on future years’ financing cash flows will depend in part on the volume of employee stock option exercises during a particular year and the relationship between the exercisedate market value of the underlying stock and the original grantdate fair value previously determined for financial reporting purposes 

realized windfall tax benefits are credited to additional paidin capital within the consolidated balance sheets realized shortfall tax benefits amounts which are less than that previously recognized in earnings are first offset against the cumulative balance of windfall tax benefits if any and then charged directly to income tax expense potentially resulting in volatility in our consolidated effective income tax rate we calculated a cumulative amount of windfall tax benefits for the purpose of accounting for future shortfall tax benefits and currently have sufficient cumulative windfall tax benefits to absorb projected arising shortfalls such that we do not currently expect future earnings to be affected by this provision however as employee stock option exercise behavior is not within our control it is possible that significantly different reported results could occur if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail 

 

income taxes 

we apply a morelikelythannot threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions accordingly we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement future changes in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect earnings in the quarter of such change for more information on income taxes please refer to note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plans 

we have defined benefit pension plans covering many employees in the united states canada france and the united kingdom we also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to many of our retirees in the united states canada and brazil under certain circumstances we also provide accruable benefits to former and inactive employees in the united states canada and mexico and members of our board of directors including severance and certain other benefits payable upon death please refer to note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for a description of our defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plans 

we recognize benefits provided during retirement or following employment over the plan participants’ active working lives accordingly we make various assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement of our obligations assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our net periodic benefit expense or income and accumulated benefit obligations include the longterm rates of return on plan assets the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our benefit plans and health care cost trend rates 

expected rate of return on plan assets 

our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation our historical longterm investment performance our estimate of future longterm returns by asset class using input from our actuaries investment services and investment managers and longterm inflation assumptions we review this assumption annually for each plan however our annual investment performance for one particular year does not by itself significantly influence our evaluation 

our historical investment returns compound annual growth rates for our united states defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets were 07 percent 78 percent 66 percent 74 percent and 86 percent for the 1 5 10 15 and 20 year periods ended may 29 2016 

on a weightedaverage basis the expected rate of return for all defined benefit plans was 853 percent for fiscal 2016 853 percent for fiscal 2015 and 853 percent for fiscal 2014 during fiscal 2016 we lowered our weightedaverage expected rate of return on plan assets for our principal defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in the united states to 825 percent due to asset changes that decreased investment risk in the portfolio 

lowering the expected longterm rate of return on assets by 100 basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense by 64 million for fiscal 2017 a marketrelated valuation basis is used to reduce yeartoyear expense volatility the marketrelated valuation recognizes certain investment gains or losses over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the marketrelated value of assets and the actual return based on the marketrelated value of assets our outside actuaries perform these calculations as part of our determination of annual expense or income 

discount rates 

our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of the last day of our fiscal year for our defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plan obligations we work with our outside actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan participants and using the aa above median corporate bond yield to develop a forward interest rate curve including a margin to that index based on our credit risk this forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions 

 

our weightedaverage discount rates were as follows 

 

 lowering the discount rates by 100 basis points would increase our net defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plan expense for fiscal 2017 by approximately 96 million all obligationrelated experience gains and losses are amortized using a straightline method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants 

health care cost trend rates 

we review our health care cost trend rates annually our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims experience and information provided by our actuaries this information includes recent plan experience plan design overall industry experience and projections and assumptions used by other similar organizations our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with this review recent experiences and shortterm expectations our initial health care cost trend rate assumption is 75 percent for retirees age 65 and over and 73 percent for retirees under age 65 at the end of fiscal 2016 rates are graded down annually until the ultimate trend rate of 50 percent is reached in 2024 for all retirees the trend rates are applicable for calculations only if the retirees’ benefits increase as a result of health care inflation the ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually as necessary to approximate the current economic view on the rate of longterm inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium assumed trend rates for health care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans 

a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate would have the following effects 

 

 any arising health care claims costrelated experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculation of expected future claims once recognized experience gains and losses are amortized using a straightline method over 10 years resulting in at least the minimum amortization required being recorded 

financial statement impact 

in fiscal 2016 we recorded net defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plan expense of 163 million compared to 153 million of expense in fiscal 2015 and 140 million of expense in fiscal 2014 as of may 29 2016 we had cumulative unrecognized actuarial net losses of 19 billion on our defined benefit pension plans and 72 million on our postretirement and postemployment benefit plans mainly as the result of liability increases from lower interest rates partially offset by recent increases in the values of plan assets these unrecognized actuarial net losses will result in increases in our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses because they currently exceed the corridors defined by gaap 

assumed mortality rates of plan participants are a critical estimate in measuring the expected payments a participant will receive over their lifetime and the amount of expense we recognize on october 27 2014 the society of actuaries published rp2014 mortality tables and mortality improvement scale mp2014 which both reflect 

 

improved longevity in fiscal 2015 we adopted the change to the mortality assumptions to remeasure our defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans obligations which increased the total of these obligations by 437 million in fiscal 2015 in addition these assumptions increased the fiscal 2016 expense associated with these plans by 72 million 

actual future net defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plan income or expense will depend on investment performance changes in future discount rates changes in health care cost trend rates and other factors related to the populations participating in these plans 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in march 2016 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new accounting requirements for the accounting and presentation of stockbased payments this will result in realized windfall and shortfall tax benefits upon exercise or vesting of stockbased awards being recorded in our consolidated statements of earnings in addition to other presentation changes the requirements of the new standard are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2018 early adoption is permitted we are in the process of analyzing the impact on our results of operations and financial position 

in february 2016 the fasb issued new accounting requirements for accounting presentation and classification of leases this will result in most leases being capitalized as a right of use asset with a related liability on our consolidated balance sheets the requirements of the new standard are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2018 and interim periods within those annual periods which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2020 we are in the process of analyzing the impact on our results of operations and financial position

in april 2015 the fasb issued new accounting requirements which permits reporting entities with a fiscal yearend that does not coincide with a monthend to apply a practical expedient that permits the entity to measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations using the monthend that is closest to the entity’s fiscal yearend and apply such practical expedient consistently to all plans the requirements of the new standard are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2015 and interim periods within those annual periods which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2017 we do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 

in may 2014 the fasb issued new accounting requirements for the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers the requirements of the new standard and its subsequent amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 and interim periods within those annual periods which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2019 we do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position

for each of these nongaap financial measures we are providing below a reconciliation of the differences between the nongaap measure and the most directly comparable gaap measure an explanation of why our management or the board of directors believes the nongaap measure provides useful information to investors and any additional purposes for which our management or board of directors uses the nongaap measure these nongaap measures should be viewed in addition to and not in lieu of the comparable gaap measure 

constantcurrency net sales growth rates 

this measure is used in reporting to our executive management and as a component of the board of directors’ measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes we believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it provides transparency to underlying performance in our consolidated net sales by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on the yeartoyear comparability given volatility in foreign currency exchange markets 

net sales growth rates on a constantcurrency basis are calculated as follows 

 

  

diluted eps excluding certain items affecting comparability and related constantcurrency growth rate 

this measure is used in reporting to our executive management and as a component of the board of directors’ measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes we believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is the profitability measure we use to evaluate earnings performance on a comparable yearoveryear basis the adjustments are either items resulting from infrequently occurring events or items that in management’s judgment significantly affect the yearoveryear assessment of operating results 

the reconciliation of our gaap measure diluted eps to diluted eps excluding certain items affecting comparability and the related constantcurrency growth rate follows 

 

        see our reconciliation below of the effective income tax rate as reported to the effective income tax rate excluding certain items affecting comparability for the tax impact of each item affecting comparability 

total segment operating profit and related constantcurrency growth rate 

this measure is used in reporting to our executive management and as a component of the board of directors’ measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes we believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is the profitability measure we use to evaluate segment performance a reconciliation of total segment operating profit to operating profit the relevant gaap measure is included in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

 

total segment operating profit growth rates on a constantcurrency basis are calculated as follows 

 

 constantcurrency aftertax earnings from joint ventures growth rates

adjusted return on average total capital 

change in adjusted return on average total capital is a measure used in reporting to our executive management and as a component of the board of director’s measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes we believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is important for assessing the utilization of capital and it eliminates certain items that affect yeartoyear comparability the calculation of adjusted return on average total capital and return on average total capital its gaap equivalent follows 

 

     

effective income tax rate excluding certain items affecting comparability 

we believe this measure provides useful information to investors because it is important for assessing the effective tax rate excluding certain items affecting comparability and presents the income tax effects of certain items affecting comparability 

effective income tax rates excluding certain items affecting comparability are calculated as follows 

 

        

free cash flow conversion rate and total cash returned to shareholders as a percentage of free cash flow 

we believe these measures provide useful information to investors because they are important for assessing our efficiency in converting earnings to cash and returning cash to shareholders the calculation of free cash flow conversion rate and net cash provided by operating activities conversion rate its equivalent gaap measure follows

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates and commodity and equity prices changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows in the normal course of business we actively manage our exposure to these market risks by entering into various hedging transactions authorized under established policies that place clear controls on these activities the counterparties in these transactions are generally highly rated institutions we establish credit limits for each counterparty our hedging transactions include but are not limited to a variety of derivative financial instruments for information on interest rate foreign exchange commodity price and equity instrument risk please see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

value at risk 

the estimates in the table below are intended to measure the maximum potential fair value we could lose in one day from adverse changes in market interest rates foreign exchange rates commodity prices and equity prices under normal market conditions a monte carlo valueatrisk var methodology was used to quantify the market risk for our exposures the models assumed normal market conditions and used a 95 percent confidence level 

the var calculation used historical interest and foreign exchange rates and commodity and equity prices from the past year to estimate the potential volatility and correlation of these rates in the future the market data were drawn from the riskmetrics™ data set the calculations are not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that we expect to incur further since the hedging instrument the derivative inversely correlates with the underlying exposure we would expect that any loss or gain in the fair value of our derivatives would be generally offset by an increase or decrease in the fair value of the underlying exposure the positions included in the calculations were debt investments interest rate swaps foreign exchange forwards commodity swaps futures and options and equity instruments the calculations do not include the underlying foreign exchange and commodities or equityrelated positions that are offset by these marketrisksensitive instruments 

 

the table below presents the estimated maximum potential var arising from a oneday loss in fair value for our interest rate foreign currency commodity and equity marketrisksensitive instruments outstanding as of may 29 2016 and may 31 2015 and the average fair value impact during the year ended may 29 2016

 item 1a risk factors tableend our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties any of the risks described below could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the food categories in which we participate are very competitive and if we are not able to compete effectively our results of operations could be adversely affected 

the food categories in which we participate are very competitive our principal competitors in these categories all have substantial financial marketing and other resources in most product categories we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products but also with regional brands and with generic and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices competition in our product categories is based on product innovation product quality price brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing promotional activity and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences if our large competitors were to seek an advantage through pricing or promotional changes we could choose to do the same which could adversely affect our margins and profitability if we did not do the same our revenues and market share could be adversely affected our market share and revenue growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing innovative products in response to changing consumer demands or by new product introductions of our competitors if we are unable to build and sustain brand equity by offering recognizably superior product quality we may be unable to maintain premium pricing over generic and private label products 

we may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face of a consolidating retail environment 

there has been significant consolidation in the grocery industry resulting in customers with increased purchasing power in addition large retail customers may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency lower pricing increased reliance on their own brand name products increased emphasis on generic and other economy brands and increased promotional programs if we are unable to use our scale marketing expertise product innovation knowledge of consumers’ needs and category leadership positions to respond to these demands our profitability and volume growth could be negatively impacted in addition the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could adversely affect our sales and profits for more information on significant customers please see company overview in item 1 of this report 

price changes for the commodities we depend on for raw materials packaging and energy may adversely affect our profitability 

the principal raw materials that we use are commodities that experience price volatility caused by external conditions such as weather product scarcity limited sources of supply commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations commodity price changes may result in unexpected increases in raw material packaging and energy costs if we are unable to increase productivity to offset these increased costs or increase our prices we may experience reduced margins and profitability we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and the risk management procedures that we do use may not always work as we intend 

  

volatility in the market value of derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices will cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings 

we utilize derivatives to manage price risk for some of our principal ingredient and energy costs including grains oats wheat and corn oils principally soybean dairy products natural gas and diesel fuel changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded in earnings currently resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings these gains and losses are reported in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of earnings and in unallocated corporate items in our segment operating results until we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating profit we also record our grain inventories at fair value we may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments 

if we are not efficient in our production our profitability could suffer as a result of the highly competitive environment in which we operate 

our future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to be efficient in the production and manufacture of our products in highly competitive markets gaining additional efficiencies may become more difficult over time our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or by eliminating redundant costs resulting from acquisitions or divestitures could adversely affect our profitability and weaken our competitive position many productivity initiatives involve complex reorganization of manufacturing facilities and production lines such manufacturing realignment may result in the interruption of production which may negatively impact product volume and margins we are currently pursuing several multiyear restructuring and cost savings initiatives designed to increase our efficiency and reduce expenses if we are unable to execute those initiatives as planned we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

disruption of our supply chain could adversely affect our business 

our ability to make move and sell products is critical to our success damage or disruption to raw material supplies or our manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather including any potential effects of climate change natural disaster fire terrorism cyberattack pandemic strikes import restrictions or other factors could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or to effectively manage such events if they occur particularly when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location could adversely affect our business and results of operations as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain 

concerns with the safety and quality of food products could cause consumers to avoid certain food products or ingredients 

we could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients adverse publicity about these types of concerns whether or not valid may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions 

if our food products become adulterated misbranded or mislabeled we might need to recall those items and may experience product liability claims if consumers are injured 

we may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated misbranded or mislabeled a widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time we could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us a significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity damage to our reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in our food products which could have an adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands 

we may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and trends which may result in decreased demand for our products 

our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes and eating habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences consumer preferences and categorylevel consumption may change from 

  

time to time and can be affected by a number of different trends and other factors if we fail to anticipate identify or react to these changes and trends or to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis we may experience reduced demand for our products which would in turn cause our revenues and profitability to suffer similarly demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns regarding the health effects of ingredients such as sodium trans fats genetically modified organisms sugar processed wheat or other product ingredients or attributes 

we may be unable to grow our market share or add products that are in faster growing and more profitable categories 

the food industry’s growth potential is constrained by population growth our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business faster than populations are growing in the markets that we serve one way to achieve that growth is to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new products in faster growing and more profitable categories our future results will also depend on our ability to increase market share in our existing product categories if we do not succeed in developing innovative products for new and existing categories our growth may slow which could adversely affect our profitability 

economic downturns could limit consumer demand for our products 

the willingness of consumers to purchase our products depends in part on local economic conditions in periods of economic uncertainty consumers may purchase more generic private label and other economy brands and may forego certain purchases altogether in those circumstances we could experience a reduction in sales of higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings in addition as a result of economic conditions or competitive actions we may be unable to raise our prices sufficiently to protect margins consumers may also reduce the amount of food that they consume away from home at customers that purchase products from our convenience stores and foodservice segment any of these events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

our results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands 

maintaining and continually enhancing the value of our many iconic brands is critical to the success of our business the value of our brands is based in large part on the degree to which consumers react and respond positively to these brands brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner adverse publicity about our products our failure to maintain the quality of our products the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences concerns about food safety or our products becoming unavailable to consumers the growing use of social and digital media by consumers us and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared negative posts or comments about us our brands or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation if we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands our business results could be negatively impacted 

our international operations are subject to political and economic risks 

in fiscal 2015 29 percent of our consolidated net sales were generated outside of the united states we are accordingly subject to a number of risks relating to doing business internationally any of which could significantly harm our business these risks include 

 

        

our financial performance on a us dollar denominated basis is subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates these fluctuations could cause material variations in our results of operations our principal exposures are to the australian dollar brazilian real british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese renminbi euro japanese yen mexican peso and swiss franc from time to time we enter into agreements that are intended to reduce the effects of our exposure to currency fluctuations but these agreements may not be effective in significantly reducing our exposure 

new regulations or regulatorybased claims could adversely affect our business 

our facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the united states department of agriculture the federal food and drug administration the occupational safety and health administration and other federal state local and foreign governmental agencies relating to the production packaging storage distribution quality and safety of food products and the health and safety of our employees our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits administrative penalties and civil remedies including fines injunctions and recalls of our products we advertise our products and could be the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal state and foreign laws and regulations we may also be subject to new laws or regulations restricting our right to advertise our products including proposals to limit advertising to children changes in laws or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements on us could increase our cost of doing business or restrict our actions causing our results of operations to be adversely affected 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations our failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits administrative penalties and civil remedies we are currently party to a variety of environmental remediation obligations due to regulatory complexities uncertainties inherent in litigation and the risk of unidentified contaminants on current and former properties of ours the potential exists for remediation liability indemnification and compliance costs to differ from our estimates we cannot guarantee that our costs in relation to these matters or compliance with environmental laws in general will not exceed our established liabilities or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could limit financing and other options and in some cases adversely affect our ability to pay dividends 

as of may 31 2015 we had total debt redeemable interests and noncontrolling interests of 104 billion the agreements under which we have issued indebtedness do not prevent us from incurring additional unsecured indebtedness in the future our level of indebtedness may limit our 

 

  there are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments and noncontrolling interests if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the related indebtedness and other unrelated indebtedness could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity and our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing may also be adversely affected 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt and other obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control 

  

global capital and credit market issues could negatively affect our liquidity increase our costs of borrowing and disrupt the operations of our suppliers and customers 

we depend on stable liquid and wellfunctioning capital and credit markets to fund our operations although we believe that our operating cash flows financial assets access to capital and credit markets and revolving credit agreements will permit us to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future there can be no assurance that future volatility or disruption in the capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing we also utilize interest rate derivatives to reduce the volatility of our financing costs if we are not effective in hedging this volatility we may experience an increase in our costs of borrowing our business could also be negatively impacted if our suppliers or customers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy 

volatility in the securities markets interest rates and other factors could substantially increase our defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit costs 

we sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the united states canada and various foreign locations including defined benefit pension retiree health and welfare severance and other postemployment plans our major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments changes in interest rates mortality rates health care costs early retirement rates investment returns and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plans a significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations 

our business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or are breached 

information technology serves an important role in the efficient and effective operation of our business we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information to manage a variety of business processes and to comply with regulatory legal and tax requirements our information technology systems and infrastructure are critical to effectively manage our key business processes including digital marketing order entry and fulfillment supply chain management finance administration and other business processes these technologies enable internal and external communication among our locations employees suppliers customers and others and include the receipt and storage of personal information about our employees and proprietary business information our information technology systems some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties may be vulnerable to damage interruption or shutdown due to any number of causes such as catastrophic events natural disasters fires power outages systems failures telecommunications failures security breaches computer viruses hackers and other causes increased cybersecurity threats pose a potential risk to the security and viability of our information technology systems as well as the confidentiality integrity and availability of the data stored on those systems the failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and result in transaction errors processing inefficiencies data loss and the loss of sales and customers any interruption of our information technology systems could have operational reputational legal and financial impacts that may have a material adverse effect on our business 

a change in the assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses or a different weightedaverage cost of capital used to value our reporting units or our indefinitelived intangible assets could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth 

as of may 31 2015 we had 131 billion of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets goodwill for each of our reporting units is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred we compare the carrying value of the net assets of a reporting unit including goodwill to the fair value of the unit if the fair value of the net assets of the reporting unit is less than the net assets including goodwill impairment has occurred our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our longrange planning process we also make estimates of discount rates perpetuity growth assumptions market comparables and other factors 

  

while we currently believe that our goodwill is not impaired different assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses could result in significant impairment losses 

we evaluate the useful lives of our intangible assets primarily intangible assets associated with the pillsbury  totino’s  progresso  green giant  yoplait  old el paso  yoki  häagendazs  and annie’s brands to determine if they are finite or indefinitelived reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry known technological advances legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 

our indefinitelived intangible assets are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable our estimate of the fair value of the brands is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs including projected revenues from our longrange plan assumed royalty rates which could be payable if we did not own the brands and a discount rate our green giant  uncle toby’s  and mountain high brands have experienced declining business performance and we will continue to monitor these businesses for further information on goodwill and intangible assets please refer to note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

our failure to successfully integrate acquisitions into our existing operations could adversely affect our financial results 

from time to time we evaluate potential acquisitions or joint ventures that would further our strategic objectives our success depends in part upon our ability to integrate acquired and existing operations if we are unable to successfully integrate acquisitions our financial results could suffer additional potential risks associated with acquisitions include additional debt leverage the loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business the assumption of unknown liabilities the inherent risk associated with entering a geographic area or line of business in which we have no or limited prior experience failure to achieve anticipated synergies and the impairment of goodwill or other acquisitionrelated intangible assets

we are a global consumer foods company we develop distinctive valueadded food products and market them under unique brand names we work continuously to improve our core products and to create new products that meet consumers’ evolving needs and preferences in addition we build the equity of our brands over time with strong consumerdirected marketing innovative new products and effective merchandising we believe our brandbuilding strategy is the key to winning and sustaining leading share positions in markets around the globe 

our fundamental financial goal is to generate superior returns for our stockholders over the long term we believe that increases in net sales segment operating profit earnings per share eps and return on average total capital are the key drivers of financial performance for our business 

our longterm growth objectives are to consistently deliver 

 

  

  

  

 we believe that this financial performance coupled with an attractive dividend yield should result in longterm value creation for stockholders we return a substantial amount of cash to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases 

our fiscal 2015 performance was mixed our two smaller operating segments delivered growth operating profit for the convenience stores and foodservice segment increased 15 percent to an alltime high of 353 million operating results for the international segment were muted by a significant negative impact from foreign currency exchange and slowing economic growth in key emerging markets but the segment achieved good margin expansion and profit growth in constant currency results for our us retail segment were disappointing as both net sales and segment operating profit declined our brands achieved share gains in categories representing 65 percent of our products’ sales in measured us retail channels but overall sales trends in many categories were weak reflecting the impact of changing consumer food preferences 

our consolidated net sales for the fiscal year ended may 31 2015 declined 2 percent to 176 billion as unfavorable foreign exchange offset the benefits of a 53 rd week and six months of incremental contribution from the annie’s inc annie’s natural and organic foods business acquired in october 2014 on a constantcurrency basis net sales increased 1 percent total segment operating profit of 30 billion declined 4 percent and 2 percent in constant currency diluted eps declined 30 percent to 197 per share adjusted diluted eps which excludes certain items affecting comparability of results rose 1 percent to 286 per share and increased 4 percent on a constantcurrency basis these results were in line with our expectations which were revised in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 our return on average total capital declined 40 basis points to 112 percent see the “nongaap measures” section below for discussion of total segment operating profit adjusted diluted eps constantcurrency nets sales growth rates constantcurrency total segment operating profit growth rate constantcurrency adjusted diluted eps growth rate and return on average total capital which are not defined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap 

net cash provided by operations totaled 25 billion in fiscal 2015 this cash generation supported capital investments totaling 712 million in fiscal 2015 we also returned significant cash to stockholders through an 8 percent dividend increase and share repurchases totaling 12 billion 

we recorded the following achievements related to our other key operating objectives for fiscal 2015 

 

   

cereal varieties robust consumer demand across international markets for new old el paso mexican food items and doubledigit growth for our us portfolio of natural and organic food products 

 

  

  

  

  

 a detailed review of our fiscal 2015 performance appears below in the section titled “fiscal 2015 consolidated results of operations” 

our sales and earnings growth targets for fiscal 2016 reflect the impact of one less week compared to fiscal 2015 the annie’s business will contribute 6 months of incremental results we expect foreign currency exchange will continue to have a negative impact on reported results for our international operations and we expect the operating environment in our large developing markets china and brazil to remain uncertain we estimate our input cost inflation for fiscal 2016 at 2 percent with these assumptions in mind

net sales declined 2 percent to 17630 million in fiscal 2015 from 17910 in fiscal 2014 the components of net sales growth are shown in the following table 

 

  the 53 rd week in fiscal 2015 contributed approximately 1 percentage point of net sales growth reflecting 1 percentage point of growth from volume 

cost of sales increased 141 million in fiscal 2015 to 11681 million in fiscal 2015 we recorded a 90 million net increase in cost of sales related to marktomarket valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories as described in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report compared to a net decrease of 49 million in fiscal 2014 in fiscal 2015 we recorded 60 million of restructuring charges in cost of sales product mix drove a 17 million increase in cost of sales we also recorded a 3 million foreign exchange loss in fiscal 2015 related to venezuela currency devaluation compared to a 23 million loss in fiscal 2014 lower volume drove a 68 million decrease in cost of sales

our consolidated effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 of 333 percent was consistent with fiscal 2014 the 45 percentage point impact resulting from the repatriation of 606 million of foreign earnings in fiscal 2015 was offset by changes in earnings mix by country certain favorable discrete items and favorable state tax rate changes 

  

aftertax earnings from joint ventures for fiscal 2015 decreased to 84 million compared to 90 million in fiscal 2014 primarily driven by unfavorable foreign currency exchange and an asset impairment charge of 3 million at cereal partners worldwide cpw in south africa the change in net sales for each joint venture is set forth in the following table

results of segment operations 

our businesses are organized into three operating segments us retail international and convenience stores and foodservice 

beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 we changed how we assess segment operating performance to exclude the asset and liability remeasurement impact from hyperinflationary economies this impact is now included in unallocated corporate items all periods presented have been changed to conform to this presentation 

the following tables provide the dollar amount and percentage of net sales and operating profit from each segment for fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013

  international change in net sales by geographic region are shown in the following table 

 

  segment operating profit for fiscal 2015 declined 2 percent to 523 million from 535 million in fiscal 2014 primarily driven by unfavorable foreign currency exchange and higher input costs partially offset by favorable net price realization and mix international segment operating profit increased 9 percent on a constantcurrency basis in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 see the “nongaap measures” section below for our use of this measure 

segment operating profit for fiscal 2014 grew 4 percent to 535 million from 515 million in fiscal 2013 primarily driven by volume growth favorable net price realization and mix and an additional quarter of results from the yoki acquisition partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency and higher input costs in addition we recorded a 17 million nonrecurring expense related to the assumption of the canadian yoplait franchise license in fiscal 2013 international segment operating profit increased 10 percent on a constantcurrency basis in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 see the “nongaap measures” section below for our use of this measure 

convenience stores and foodservice segment

for fiscal 2015 net sales for our convenience stores and foodservice segment increased 4 percent to 1995 million for fiscal 2014 net sales decreased 2 percent to 1919 million compared to 1959 million in fiscal 2013 the components of convenience stores and foodservice net sales growth are shown in the following table 

 

  the 53 rd week in fiscal 2015 contributed approximately 2 percentage points of net sales growth reflecting 2 percentage points of growth from volume 

in fiscal 2015 segment operating profit was 353 million up 15 percent from 307 million in fiscal 2014 the increase was primarily driven by favorable net price realization and mix and higher volume 

in fiscal 2014 segment operating profit was 307 million down 2 percent from 315 million in fiscal 2013 the decrease was primarily driven by volume declines unfavorable net price realization and investments to protect and grow the business 

unallocated corporate items 

beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 we changed how we assess segment operating performance to exclude the asset and liability remeasurement impact from hyperinflationary economies this impact is now included in unallocated corporate items all periods presented have been changed to conform to this presentation 

unallocated corporate items include corporate overhead expenses variances to planned domestic employee benefits and incentives contributions to the general mills foundation asset and liability remeasurement impact of hyperinflationary economies restructuring initiative projectrelated costs and other items that are not part of our measurement of segment operating performance this includes gains and losses from marktomarket valuation of certain commodity positions until passed back to our operating segments in accordance with our policy as discussed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

for fiscal 2015 unallocated corporate expense totaled 414 million compared to 258 million last year in fiscal 2015 we recorded a 90 million net increase in expense related to marktomarket valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories compared to a 49 million net decrease in expense in fiscal 2014 in addition we recorded 60 million of restructuring charges and 13 million of restructuring initiative projectrelated costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2015 we recorded an 8 million foreign exchange loss related to the remeasurement of assets and liabilities of our venezuelan subsidiary compared to 62 million in fiscal 2014 we also recorded 16 million of integration costs resulting from the acquisition of annie’s in fiscal 2015 

for fiscal 2014 unallocated corporate expense totaled 258 million compared to 351 million in fiscal 2013 in fiscal 2014 we recorded a 49 million net decrease in expense related to marktomarket valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories compared to a 4 million net decrease in expense in the prior year compensation and benefit expenses decreased 59 million and the contribution to the general mills foundation decreased in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 we also recorded a 62 million foreign exchange loss related to the remeasurement of assets and liabilities of our venezuelan subsidiary in fiscal 2014 compared to 25 million in fiscal 2013 in fiscal 2013 we also recorded 12 million of integration costs related to the acquisition of yoki 

  

venezuela is a highly inflationary economy and we remeasure the value of the assets and liabilities of our venezuelan subsidiary based on the exchange rate at which we expect to remit dividends in us dollars in february 2014 the venezuelan government established a new foreign exchange market mechanism sicad 2 and at that time indicated that it would be the market through which us dollars would be obtained for the remittance of dividends on february 12 2015 the venezuelan government replaced sicad 2 with a new foreign exchange market mechanism simadi we expect to be able to access us dollars through the simadi market simadi has significantly higher foreign exchange rates than those available through the other foreign exchange mechanisms in fiscal 2015 we recorded an 8 million foreign exchange loss in unallocated corporate items resulting from the remeasurement of assets and liabilities of our venezuelan subsidiary at the simadi rate of 199 bolivars per us dollar our venezuela operations represent less than 1 percent of our consolidated assets liabilities net sales and segment operating profit as of may 31 2015 we had 03 million of nonus dollar cash balances in venezuela 

impact of inflation 

our gross margin performance in fiscal 2015 reflects the impact of 2 percent input cost inflation primarily on commodities inputs we expect input cost inflation of 2 percent in fiscal 2016 we attempt to minimize the effects of inflation through hmm planning and operating practices our risk management practices are discussed in item 7a of this report 

liquidity 

the primary source of our liquidity is cash flow from operations over the most recent threeyear period our operations have generated 80 billion in cash a substantial portion of this operating cash flow has been returned to stockholders through share repurchases and dividends we also use cash from operations to fund our capital expenditures and acquisitions we typically use a combination of cash notes payable and longterm debt to finance significant acquisitions and major capital expansions 

as of may 31 2015 we had 311 million of cash and cash equivalents held in foreign jurisdictions which will be used to fund foreign operations and acquisitions during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 we approved a onetime repatriation of 606 million of foreign earnings this action reduced the economic cost of funding current restructuring initiatives and the acquisition of annie’s completed in fiscal 2015 we recorded a discrete income tax charge of 79 million in fiscal 2015 related to this action and we expect to make approximately 24 million in related cash income tax payments related to this action we have previously asserted that our foreign earnings are permanently reinvested and will only be repatriated in a taxneutral manner and this onetime repatriation does not change this ongoing assertion 

cash flows from operations 

 

   

in fiscal 2015 our operations generated 25 billion of cash flat compared to fiscal 2014 the 247 million change in current assets and liabilities was primarily driven by the timing of trade and promotion accruals changes in tax accruals and changes in derivative positions this was largely offset by lower net earnings which included a 260 million noncash impairment charge and 271 million of noncash restructuring charges and a 147 million change in net deferred income taxes 

we strive to grow core working capital at or below the rate of growth in our net sales for fiscal 2015 core working capital decreased 13 percent primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in accounts payable compared to a net sales decline of 2 percent in fiscal 2014 core working capital decreased 9 percent compared to net sales growth of 1 percent and in fiscal 2013 core working capital decreased 5 percent compared to net sales growth of 7 percent 

in fiscal 2014 our operations generated 25 billion of cash compared to 29 billion in fiscal 2013 the 385 million decrease was primarily due to a 503 million change in current assets and liabilities the change in current assets and liabilities was primarily driven by a 403 million change in other current liabilities largely due to changes in trade promotion and income tax accruals and a 107 million change in inventory in addition in fiscal 2013 we made a 200 million voluntary contribution to our principal domestic pension plans 

cash flows from investing activities 

 

 in fiscal 2015 cash used by investing activities increased by 10 billion from fiscal 2014 we invested 712 million in land buildings and equipment in fiscal 2015 49 million more than the same period last year in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 we acquired annie’s a publicly traded food company headquartered in berkeley california for an aggregate purchase price of 809 million net of 12 million of cash acquired we made 102 million of investments in affiliates primarily cpw in fiscal 2015 in addition we received 28 million in payments from sodiaal international sodiaal in fiscal 2015 against the 132 million exchangeable note we purchased in fiscal 2012 

in fiscal 2014 cash used by investing activities decreased by 954 million from fiscal 2013 we invested 664 million in land buildings and equipment in fiscal 2014 50 million more than in fiscal 2013 we made 55 million of investments in affiliates primarily cpw in fiscal 2014 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 we sold certain grain elevators for 124 million in cash including a working capital adjustment finalized in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 in addition we received 29 million in payments from sodiaal in fiscal 2014 against the exchangeable note 

we expect capital expenditures to be approximately 840 million in fiscal 2016 these expenditures will fund initiatives that are expected to fuel international growth support innovative products and continue hmm initiatives throughout the supply chain 

  

cash flows from financing activities 

 

 net cash used by financing activities decreased by 439 million in fiscal 2015 we had 204 million less net debt issuances in fiscal 2015 than the same period a year ago for more information on our debt issuances and payments please refer to note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

during fiscal 2015 we received 164 million in proceeds from common stock issued on exercised options compared to 108 million in fiscal 2014 an increase of 56 million during fiscal 2013 we received 301 million in proceeds from common stock issued on exercised options 

in may 2014 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 100 million shares of our common stock purchases under the authorization can be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions including the use of call options and other derivative instruments rule 10b51 trading plans and accelerated repurchase programs the authorization has no specified termination date 

during fiscal 2015 we repurchased 22 million shares of our common stock for 1162 million during fiscal 2014 we repurchased 36 million shares of our common stock for 1745 million during fiscal 2013 we repurchased 24 million shares of our common stock for 1015 million 

dividends paid in fiscal 2015 totaled 1018 million or 167 per share an 8 percent per share increase from fiscal 2014 dividends paid in fiscal 2014 totaled 983 million or 155 per share a 17 percent per share increase from fiscal 2013 dividends of 132 per share on march 10 2015 our board of directors approved a 5 percent dividend increase effective with the may 1 2015 payment to an annualized rate of 176 per share 

selected cash flows from joint ventures 

selected cash flows from our joint ventures are set forth in the following table 

 

   

capital resources 

total capital consisted of the following 

 

 the following table details the feepaid committed and uncommitted credit lines we had available as of may 31 2015 

 

 to ensure availability of funds we maintain bank credit lines sufficient to cover our outstanding notes payable commercial paper is a continuing source of shortterm financing we have commercial paper programs available to us in the united states and europe we also have uncommitted and assetbacked credit lines that support our foreign operations the credit facilities contain several covenants including a requirement to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 25 times 

certain of our longterm debt agreements our credit facilities and our noncontrolling interests contain restrictive covenants as of may 31 2015 we were in compliance with all of these covenants 

we have 1000 million of longterm debt maturing in the next 12 months that is classified as current we believe that cash flows from operations together with available short and longterm debt financing will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for at least the next 12 months 

as of may 31 2015 our total debt including the impact of derivative instruments designated as hedges was 72 percent in fixedrate and 28 percent in floatingrate instruments compared to 71 percent in fixedrate and 29 percent in floatingrate instruments on may 25 2014 

improvement in return on average total capital is one of our key performance measures see the “nongaap measures” section below for our discussion of this measure which is not defined by gaap return on average total capital decreased 40 basis points from 116 percent in fiscal 2014 to 112 percent in fiscal 2015 as fiscal 2015 earnings declined on a constantcurrency basis return on average total capital decreased 20 basis points we also believe that our fixed charge coverage ratio and the ratio of operating cash flow to debt are important measures of our financial strength our fixed charge coverage ratio in fiscal 2015 was 554 compared to 804 in fiscal 2014 the measure decreased from fiscal 2014 as earnings before income taxes and aftertax earnings from joint ventures decreased by 893 million including a 260 million noncash pretax charge related to an indefinitelived intangible 

  

asset impairment and a 344 million pretax increase in restructuring charges in fiscal 2015 our operating cash flow to debt ratio decreased 13 percentage points to 276 percent in fiscal 2015 driven by an increase in total debt 

we have a 51 percent controlling interest in yoplait sas and a 50 percent interest in yoplait marques snc and liberté marques sàrl sodiaal holds the remaining interests in each of these entities we consolidate these entities into our consolidated financial statements we record sodiaal’s 50 percent interest in yoplait marques snc and liberté marques sàrl as noncontrolling interests and their 49 percent interest in yoplait sas as a redeemable interest on our consolidated balance sheets these euro and canadian dollardenominated interests are reported in us dollars on our consolidated balance sheets sodiaal has the ability to put a limited portion of its redeemable interest to us at fair value once per year through a maximum term expiring december 2020 as of may 31 2015 the redemption value of the redeemable interest was 779 million which approximates its fair value 

the thirdparty holder of the general mills cereals llc gmc class a interests receives quarterly preferred distributions from available net income based on the application of a floating preferred return rate to the holder’s capital account balance established in the most recent marktomarket valuation currently 252 million for fiscal 2015 the floating preferred rate was equal to the sum of threemonth libor plus 110 basis points the preferred return rate is adjusted every three years through a negotiated agreement with the class a interest holder or through a remarketing auction on june 1 2015 subsequent to our yearend the floating preferred return rate on gmc’s class a interests was reset to the sum of threemonth libor plus 125 basis points 

we have an option to purchase the class a interests for consideration equal to the then current capital account value plus any unpaid preferred return and the prescribed makewhole amount if we purchase these interests any change in the thirdparty holder’s capital account from its original value will be charged directly to retained earnings and will increase or decrease the net earnings used to calculate eps in that period 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

as of may 31 2015 we have issued guarantees and comfort letters of 434 million for the debt and other obligations of consolidated subsidiaries and guarantees and comfort letters of 258 million for the debt and other obligations of nonconsolidated affiliates mainly cpw in addition offbalance sheet arrangements are generally limited to the future payments under noncancelable operating leases which totaled 400 million as of may 31 2015 

as of may 31 2015 we had invested in five variable interest entities vies none of our vies are material to our results of operations financial condition or liquidity as of and for the year ended may 31 2015 

  

the following table summarizes our future estimated cash payments under existing contractual obligations including payments due by period 

 

       

significant accounting estimates 

for a complete description of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report our significant accounting estimates are those that have a meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations these estimates include our accounting for promotional expenditures valuation of longlived assets intangible assets redeemable interest stockbased compensation income taxes and defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plans 

promotional expenditures 

our promotional activities are conducted through our customers and directly or indirectly with end consumers these activities include payments to customers to perform merchandising activities on our behalf such as advertising or instore displays discounts to our list prices to lower retail shelf prices payments to gain distribution of new products coupons contests and other incentives and media and advertising expenditures the recognition of these costs requires estimation of customer participation and performance levels these estimates are based on the forecasted customer sales the timing and forecasted costs of promotional activities and other factors differences between estimated expenses and actual costs are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period our accrued trade coupon and consumer marketing liabilities were 565 million as of may 31 2015 and 578 million as of may 25 2014 because our total promotional expenditures including amounts classified as a reduction of revenues are significant if our estimates are inaccurate we would have to make adjustments in subsequent periods that could have a material effect on our results of operations 

valuation of longlived assets 

we estimate the useful lives of longlived assets and make estimates concerning undiscounted cash flows to review for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent appraisals as appropriate 

intangible assets 

goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization and are tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred our estimates of fair value for goodwill impairment testing are determined based on a discounted cash flow model we use inputs from our longrange planning process to determine growth rates for sales and profits we also make estimates of discount rates perpetuity growth assumptions market comparables and other factors 

we evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets mainly brands to determine if they are finite or indefinitelived reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry known technological advances legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets intangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized on a straightline basis over their useful lives generally ranging from 4 to 30 years our estimate of the fair value of our brand assets is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs which include projected revenues from our longrange plan assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands and a discount rate 

  

as of may 31 2015 we had 131 billion of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets while we currently believe that the fair value of each intangible exceeds its carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses or a different weightedaverage cost of capital wacc could result in significant impairment losses and amortization expense we performed our fiscal 2015 assessment of our intangible assets as of november 24 2014 as of our annual assessment date there was no impairment of any of our intangible assets as their related fair values were substantially in excess of the carrying values except for the mountain high  uncle toby’s and green giant brands the excess fair value above the carrying value of these brand assets were as follows 

 

 at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 we made a strategic decision to redirect certain resources supporting our green giant business in our us retail segment to other businesses within the segment therefore future sales and profitability projections in our longrange plan for this business declined as a result of this triggering event we performed an interim impairment assessment of the green giant brand intangible asset as of may 31 2015 and determined that the fair value of the brand asset no longer exceeded the carrying value of the asset significant assumptions used in that assessment included our updated longrange cash flow projections for the green giant business an updated royalty rate a wacc and a tax rate we recorded a 260 million impairment charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 related to this asset 

our green giant  uncle toby’s and mountain high brands have experienced declining business performance and we will continue to monitor these businesses 

redeemable interest 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2015 we adjusted the redemption value of sodiaal’s redeemable interest in yoplait sas based on a discounted cash flow model the significant assumptions used to estimate the redemption value include projected revenue growth and profitability from our longrange plan capital spending depreciation and taxes foreign currency exchange rates and a discount rate as of may 31 2015 the redemption value of the redeemable interest was 779 million 

stockbased compensation 

the valuation of stock options is a significant accounting estimate that requires us to use judgments and assumptions that are likely to have a material impact on our financial statements annually we make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility employee exercise behavior dividend yield and the forfeiture rate for more information on these assumptions please refer to note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

  

the estimated fair values of stock options granted and the assumptions used for the blackscholes optionpricing model were as follows 

 

 the riskfree interest rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based on the us treasury zerocoupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant an increase in the expected term by 1 year leaving all other assumptions constant would increase the grant date fair value by 2 percent if all other assumptions are held constant a one percentage point increase in our fiscal 2015 volatility assumption would increase the grant date fair value of our fiscal 2015 option awards by 7 percent 

to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our assumptions we are not required to true up grantdate fair valuebased expense to final intrinsic values however these differences can impact the classification of cash tax benefits realized upon exercise of stock options as explained in the following two paragraphs furthermore historical data has a significant bearing on our forwardlooking assumptions significant variances between actual and predicted experience could lead to prospective revisions in our assumptions which could then significantly impact the yearoveryear comparability of stockbased compensation expense 

any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings referred to as a windfall tax benefit is presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows as a financing cash flow the actual impact on future years’ financing cash flows will depend in part on the volume of employee stock option exercises during a particular year and the relationship between the exercisedate market value of the underlying stock and the original grantdate fair value previously determined for financial reporting purposes 

realized windfall tax benefits are credited to additional paidin capital within the consolidated balance sheets realized shortfall tax benefits amounts which are less than that previously recognized in earnings are first offset against the cumulative balance of windfall tax benefits if any and then charged directly to income tax expense potentially resulting in volatility in our consolidated effective income tax rate we calculated a cumulative amount of windfall tax benefits for the purpose of accounting for future shortfall tax benefits and currently have sufficient cumulative windfall tax benefits to absorb projected arising shortfalls such that we do not currently expect future earnings to be affected by this provision however as employee stock option exercise behavior is not within our control it is possible that materially different reported results could occur if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail 

income taxes 

we apply a morelikelythannot threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions accordingly we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement future changes in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect earnings in the quarter of such change for more information on income taxes please refer to note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

  

defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plans 

we have defined benefit pension plans covering many employees in the united states canada france and the united kingdom we also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to many of our retirees in the united states canada and brazil under certain circumstances we also provide accruable benefits to former or inactive employees in the united states canada and mexico and members of our board of directors including severance and certain other benefits payable upon death please refer to note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for a description of our defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plans 

we recognize benefits provided during retirement or following employment over the plan participants’ active working lives accordingly we make various assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement of our obligations assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our net periodic benefit expense or income and accumulated benefit obligations include the longterm rates of return on plan assets the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our benefit plans and health care cost trend rates 

expected rate of return on plan assets 

our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation our historical longterm investment performance our estimate of future longterm returns by asset class using input from our actuaries investment services and investment managers and longterm inflation assumptions we review this assumption annually for each plan however our annual investment performance for one particular year does not by itself significantly influence our evaluation 

our historical investment returns compound annual growth rates for our united states defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets were 65 percent 117 percent 81 percent 78 percent and 96 percent for the 1 5 10 15 and 20 year periods ended may 31 2015 

on a weightedaverage basis the expected rate of return for all defined benefit plans was 853 percent for fiscal 2015 853 percent for fiscal 2014 and 853 percent for fiscal 2013 

lowering the expected longterm rate of return on assets by 100 basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense by 62 million for fiscal 2016 a marketrelated valuation basis is used to reduce yeartoyear expense volatility the marketrelated valuation recognizes certain investment gains or losses over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the marketrelated value of assets and the actual return based on the marketrelated value of assets our outside actuaries perform these calculations as part of our determination of annual expense or income 

discount rates 

our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of the last day of our fiscal year for our defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plan obligations we work with our outside actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan participants and using the aa above median corporate bond yield to develop a forward interest rate curve including a margin to that index based on our credit risk this forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions 

  

our weightedaverage discount rates were as follows 

 

 lowering the discount rates by 100 basis points would increase our net defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plan expense for fiscal 2016 by approximately 167 million all obligationrelated experience gains and losses are amortized using a straightline method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants 

health care cost trend rates 

we review our health care cost trend rates annually our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims experience and information provided by our actuaries this information includes recent plan experience plan design overall industry experience and projections and assumptions used by other similar organizations our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with this review recent experiences and shortterm expectations our initial health care cost trend rate assumption is 73 percent for retirees age 65 and over and 65 percent for retirees under age 65 at the end of fiscal 2015 rates are graded down annually until the ultimate trend rate of 50 percent is reached in 2025 for all retirees the trend rates are applicable for calculations only if the retirees’ benefits increase as a result of health care inflation the ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually as necessary to approximate the current economic view on the rate of longterm inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium assumed trend rates for health care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans 

a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate would have the following effects 

 

 any arising health care claims costrelated experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculation of expected future claims once recognized experience gains and losses are amortized using a straightline method over 15 years resulting in at least the minimum amortization required being recorded 

financial statement impact 

in fiscal 2015 we recorded net defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plan expense of 153 million compared to 140 million of expense in fiscal 2014 and 159 million of expense in fiscal 2013 as of may 31 2015 we had cumulative unrecognized actuarial net losses of 17 billion on our defined benefit pension plans and 81 million on our postretirement and postemployment benefit plans mainly as the result of liability increases from lower interest rates partially offset by recent increases in the values of plan assets these unrecognized actuarial net losses will result in increases in our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses because they currently exceed the corridors defined by gaap 

  

assumed mortality rates of plan participants are a critical estimate in measuring the expected payments a participant will receive over their lifetime and the amount of expense we recognize on october 27 2014 the society of actuaries published rp2014 mortality tables and mortality improvement scale mp2014 which both reflect improved longevity we adopted the change to the mortality assumptions to remeasure our defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans obligations which increased the total of these obligations by 437 million in addition these assumptions increased the fiscal 2016 expense associated with these plans by 72 million 

actual future net defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plan income or expense will depend on investment performance changes in future discount rates changes in health care cost trend rates and other factors related to the populations participating in these plans 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in may 2015 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new accounting requirements for the presentation of certain investments using the net asset value providing a practical expedient to exclude such investments from categorization within the fair value hierarchy and make a separate disclosure the requirements of the new standard are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2015 and interim periods within those annual periods which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2017 we do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 

in april 2015 the fasb issued new accounting requirements that permit reporting entities with a fiscal yearend that does not coincide with a monthend to apply a practical expedient to measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations using the monthend that is closest to the entity’s fiscal yearend and apply the practice consistently to all plans the requirements of the new standard are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2015 and interim periods within those annual periods which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2017 we do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 

in may 2014 the fasb issued new accounting requirements for the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers the requirements of the new standard are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2018 we do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 

in june 2014 the fasb issued new accounting requirements for sharebased payment awards issued based upon specific performance targets the requirements of the new standard are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2015 and interim periods within those annual periods which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2017 we do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 

nongaap measures 

we have included in this report measures of financial performance that are not defined by gaap we believe that these measures provide useful information to investors and include these measures in other communications to investors

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates and commodity and equity prices changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows in the normal course of business we actively manage our exposure to these market risks by entering into various hedging transactions authorized under established policies that place clear controls on these activities the counterparties in these transactions are generally highly rated institutions we establish credit limits for each counterparty our hedging transactions include but are not limited to a variety of derivative financial instruments for information on interest rate foreign exchange commodity price and equity instrument risk please see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

  

value at risk 

the estimates in the table below are intended to measure the maximum potential fair value we could lose in one day from adverse changes in market interest rates foreign exchange rates commodity prices and equity prices under normal market conditions a monte carlo valueatrisk var methodology was used to quantify the market risk for our exposures the models assumed normal market conditions and used a 95 percent confidence level 

the var calculation used historical interest and foreign exchange rates and commodity and equity prices from the past year to estimate the potential volatility and correlation of these rates in the future the market data were drawn from the riskmetrics™ data set the calculations are not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that we expect to incur further since the hedging instrument the derivative inversely correlates with the underlying exposure we would expect that any loss or gain in the fair value of our derivatives would be generally offset by an increase or decrease in the fair value of the underlying exposure the positions included in the calculations were debt investments interest rate swaps foreign exchange forwards commodity swaps futures and options and equity instruments the calculations do not include the underlying foreign exchange and commodities or equityrelated positions that are offset by these marketrisksensitive instruments 

the table below presents the estimated maximum potential var arising from a oneday loss in fair value for our interest rate foreign currency commodity and equity marketrisksensitive instruments outstanding as of may 31 2015 and may 25 2014 and the average fair value impact during the year ended may 31 2015

 item 1a risk factors tableend our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties any of the risks described below could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the food categories in which we participate are very competitive and if we are not able to compete effectively our results of operations could be adversely affected 

the food categories in which we participate are very competitive our principal competitors in these categories all have substantial financial marketing and other resources in most product categories we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products but also with generic and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices competition in our product categories is based on product innovation product quality price brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing promotional activity and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences if our large competitors were to seek an advantage through pricing or promotional changes we could choose to do the same which could adversely affect our margins and profitability if we did not do the same our revenues and market share could be adversely affected our market share and revenue growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing innovative products in response to changing consumer demands or by new product introductions of our competitors if we are unable to build and sustain brand equity by offering recognizably superior product quality we may be unable to maintain premium pricing over generic and private label products 

we may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face of a consolidating retail environment 

there has been significant consolidation in the grocery industry resulting in customers with increased purchasing power in addition large retail customers may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency lower pricing increased reliance on their own brand name products increased emphasis on generic and other economy brands and increased promotional programs if we are unable to use our scale marketing expertise product innovation knowledge of consumers’ needs and category leadership positions to respond to these demands our profitability and volume growth could be negatively impacted in addition the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could adversely affect our sales and profits for more information on significant customers please see company overview in item 1 of this report 

  

price changes for the commodities we depend on for raw materials packaging and energy may adversely affect our profitability 

the principal raw materials that we use are commodities that experience price volatility caused by external conditions such as weather product scarcity limited sources of supply commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations commodity price changes may result in unexpected increases in raw material packaging and energy costs if we are unable to increase productivity to offset these increased costs or increase our prices we may experience reduced margins and profitability we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and the risk management procedures that we do use may not always work as we intend 

volatility in the market value of derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices will cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings 

we utilize derivatives to manage price risk for some of our principal ingredient and energy costs including grains oats wheat and corn oils principally soybean dairy products natural gas and diesel fuel changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded in earnings currently resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings these gains and losses are reported in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of earnings and in unallocated corporate items in our segment operating results until we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating profit we also record our grain inventories at fair value we may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments 

if we are not efficient in our production our profitability could suffer as a result of the highly competitive environment in which we operate 

our future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to be efficient in the production and manufacture of our products in highly competitive markets gaining additional efficiencies may become more difficult over time our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or by eliminating redundant costs resulting from acquisitions could adversely affect our profitability and weaken our competitive position many productivity initiatives involve complex reorganization of manufacturing facilities and production lines such manufacturing realignment may result in the interruption of production which may negatively impact product volume and margins 

disruption of our supply chain could adversely affect our business 

our ability to make move and sell products is critical to our success damage or disruption to raw material supplies or our manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather including any potential effects of climate change natural disaster fire terrorism pandemic strikes import restrictions or other factors could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or to effectively manage such events if they occur particularly when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location could adversely affect our business and results of operations as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain 

concerns with the safety and quality of food products could cause consumers to avoid certain food products or ingredients 

we could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients adverse publicity about these types of concerns whether or not valid may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions 

  

if our food products become adulterated misbranded or mislabeled we might need to recall those items and may experience product liability claims if consumers are injured 

we may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated misbranded or mislabeled a widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time we could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us a significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity damage to our reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in our food products which could have an adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands 

we may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and trends which may result in decreased demand for our products 

our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes and eating habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences consumer preferences and categorylevel consumption may change from time to time and can be affected by a number of different trends and other factors if we fail to anticipate identify or react to these changes and trends or to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis we may experience reduced demand for our products which would in turn cause our revenues and profitability to suffer similarly demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns regarding the health effects of ingredients such as sodium trans fats genetically modified organisms sugar processed wheat or other product ingredients or attributes 

we may be unable to grow our market share or add products that are in faster growing and more profitable categories 

the food industry’s growth potential is constrained by population growth our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business faster than populations are growing in the markets that we serve one way to achieve that growth is to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new products in faster growing and more profitable categories our future results will also depend on our ability to increase market share in our existing product categories if we do not succeed in developing innovative products for new and existing categories our growth may slow which could adversely affect our profitability 

economic downturns could limit consumer demand for our products 

the willingness of consumers to purchase our products depends in part on local economic conditions in periods of economic uncertainty consumers may purchase more generic private label and other economy brands and may forego certain purchases altogether in those circumstances we could experience a reduction in sales of higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings in addition as a result of economic conditions or competitive actions we may be unable to raise our prices sufficiently to protect margins consumers may also reduce the amount of food that they consume away from home at customers that purchase products from our convenience stores and foodservice segment any of these events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

our results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands 

maintaining and continually enhancing the value of our many iconic brands is critical to the success of our business the value of our brands is based in large part on the degree to which consumers react and respond positively to these brands brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner adverse publicity about our products our failure to maintain the quality of our products the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences concerns about food safety or our products becoming unavailable to consumers the growing use of social and digital media by consumers us and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared negative posts or comments about us our brands or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation if we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands our business results could be negatively impacted 

  

our international operations are subject to political and economic risks 

in fiscal 2014 30 percent of our consolidated net sales were generated outside of the united states we are accordingly subject to a number of risks relating to doing business internationally any of which could significantly harm our business these risks include 

 

      our financial performance on a us dollar denominated basis is subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates these fluctuations could cause material variations in our results of operations our principal exposures are to the australian dollar brazilian real british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese renminbi euro japanese yen mexican peso and swiss franc from time to time we enter into agreements that are intended to reduce the effects of our exposure to currency fluctuations but these agreements may not be effective in significantly reducing our exposure 

new regulations or regulatorybased claims could adversely affect our business 

our facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the united states department of agriculture the federal food and drug administration the occupational safety and health administration and other federal state local and foreign governmental agencies relating to the production packaging storage distribution quality and safety of food products the health and safety of our employees and the protection of the environment our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits administrative penalties and civil remedies including fines injunctions and recalls of our products we advertise our products and could be the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal state and foreign laws and regulations we may also be subject to new laws or regulations restricting our right to advertise our products including proposals to limit advertising to children changes in laws or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements on us could increase our cost of doing business or restrict our actions causing our results of operations to be adversely affected 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could limit financing and other options and in some cases adversely affect our ability to pay dividends 

as of may 25 2014 we had total debt redeemable interests and noncontrolling interests of 102 billion the agreements under which we have issued indebtedness do not prevent us from incurring additional unsecured indebtedness in the future our level of indebtedness may limit our 

 

  there are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments and noncontrolling interests if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the related indebtedness and other unrelated indebtedness could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity and our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing may also be adversely affected 

  

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt and other obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control 

global capital and credit market issues could negatively affect our liquidity increase our costs of borrowing and disrupt the operations of our suppliers and customers 

we depend on stable liquid and wellfunctioning capital and credit markets to fund our operations although we believe that our operating cash flows financial assets access to capital and credit markets and revolvingcredit agreements will permit us to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future there can be no assurance that future volatility or disruption in the capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing our business could also be negatively impacted if our suppliers or customers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy 

volatility in the securities markets interest rates and other factors could substantially increase our defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit costs 

we sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the united states canada and various foreign locations including defined benefit pension retiree health and welfare severance and other postemployment plans our major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments changes in interest rates mortality rates health care costs early retirement rates investment returns and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plans a significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations 

our business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or are breached 

the efficient operation of our business depends on our information technology systems we rely on our information technology systems to effectively manage our business data communications supply chain order entry and fulfillment and other business processes the failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in transaction errors processing inefficiencies and the loss of sales and customers causing our business and results of operations to suffer in addition our information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control including fire natural disasters systems failures security breaches telecommunications failures computer viruses hackers and other security issues any such damage or interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business 

if other potentially responsible parties prps are unable to contribute to remediation costs at certain contaminated sites our costs for remediation could be material 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign environmental and health and safety laws and regulations under certain of these laws namely the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and its state counterparts liability for investigation and remediation of hazardous substance contamination at currently or formerly owned or operated facilities or at thirdparty waste disposal sites is joint and several we currently are involved in active remediation efforts at certain sites where we have been named a prp if other prps at these sites are unable to contribute to remediation costs we could be held responsible for their portion of the remediation costs and those costs could be material we cannot assure that our costs in relation to these environmental matters or compliance with environmental laws in general will not exceed our established liabilities or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

  

a change in the assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses or a different weightedaverage cost of capital used to value our reporting units or our indefinitelived intangible assets could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth 

goodwill for each of our reporting units is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred we compare the carrying value of the net assets of a reporting unit including goodwill to the fair value of the unit if the fair value of the net assets of the reporting unit is less than the net assets including goodwill impairment has occurred our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our longrange planning process we also make estimates of discount rates perpetuity growth assumptions market comparables and other factors while we currently believe that our goodwill is not impaired different assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses could result in significant impairment losses 

we evaluate the useful lives of our intangible assets primarily intangible assets associated with the pillsbury  totino’s  progresso  green giant  yoplait  old el paso  yoki  and häagendazs brands to determine if they are finite or indefinitelived reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry known technological advances legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 

our indefinitelived intangible assets are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable our estimate of the fair value of the brands is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs including projected revenues from our longrange plan assumed royalty rates which could be payable if we did not own the brands and a discount rate 

as of may 25 2014 we had 131 billion of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets our europe and yoplait us reporting units and uncle toby’s and mountain high brands have experienced declining business performance and we will continue to monitor those businesses while we currently believe that the fair value of each intangible exceeds its carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses or a different weightedaverage cost of capital could result in significant impairment losses and amortization expense for further information on goodwill and intangible assets please refer to note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

our failure to successfully integrate acquisitions into our existing operations could adversely affect our financial results 

from time to time we evaluate potential acquisitions or joint ventures that would further our strategic objectives our success depends in part upon our ability to integrate acquired and existing operations if we are unable to successfully integrate acquisitions our financial results could suffer additional potential risks associated with acquisitions include additional debt leverage the loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business the assumption of unknown liabilities the inherent risk associated with entering a geographic area or line of business in which we have no or limited prior experience failure to achieve anticipated synergies and the impairment of goodwill or other acquisitionrelated intangible assets

venezuela is a highly inflationary economy and as such we remeasure the value of the assets and liabilities of our venezuelan subsidiary based on the exchange rate at which we expect to remit dividends in us dollars in february 2013 the venezuelan government devalued the bolivar by resetting the official exchange rate the effect of the devaluation in fiscal 2013 was a 25 million foreign exchange loss in segment operating profit resulting from the remeasurement of assets and liabilities of our venezuelan subsidiary on february 19 2014 the venezuelan government established a new foreign exchange market mechanism “sicad 2” and has indicated that this will be the market through which us dollars will be obtained for the remittance of dividends this market has significantly higher foreign exchange rates than those available through the other foreign exchange mechanisms in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 we recorded a 62 million foreign exchange loss in the international segment operating profit resulting from the remeasurement of assets and liabilities of our venezuelan subsidiary at the sicad 2 rate of 500 bolivars per us dollar we have been able to access us dollars through the sicad 2 market our venezuela operations represent less than 1 percent of our consolidated assets liabilities net sales and segment operating profit as of may 25 2014 we had 3 million of nonus dollar cash balances in venezuela 

convenience stores and foodservice segment 

in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 we changed the name of our bakeries and foodservice operating segment to convenience stores and foodservice the businesses in this segment were unchanged our major product categories are readytoeat cereals snacks refrigerated yogurt unbaked and fully baked frozen dough products baking mixes and flour many products we sell are branded to the consumer and nearly all are branded to our customers we sell to distributors and operators in many customer channels including foodservice convenience stores vending and supermarket bakeries substantially all of this segment’s operations are located in the united states 

for fiscal 2014 net sales for our convenience stores and foodservice segment decreased 2 percent to 1919 million primarily driven by an 1 percentage point decrease in contributions from volume growth and 1 percentage point of unfavorable net price realization and mix volume declines were driven by the loss of business with a major customer as well as the impact of inclement weather as fiscal 2014 had a sharp increase in weatherrelated events such as school and business closings unfavorable net price realization and mix were driven by commodity index priced items 

for fiscal 2013 net sales for our convenience stores and foodservice segment decreased 1 percent to 1959 million due to an 1 percentage point decrease in contributions from volume growth net price realization and mix was flat compared to fiscal 2012 as gains from favorable product mix were offset by declines in commodity index priced items 

components of convenience stores and foodservice net sales growth 

 

  net sales for our convenience stores and foodservice segment are shown in the following table 

convenience stores and foodservice net sales 

 

   

in fiscal 2014 segment operating profit was 307 million down 2 percent from 315 million in fiscal 2013 the decrease was primarily driven by volume declines unfavorable net price realization and investments to protect and grow the business 

in fiscal 2013 segment operating profit was 315 million up 10 percent from 287 million in fiscal 2012 the increase was primarily driven by favorable product mix lower manufacturing and input costs and reduced administrative costs 

unallocated corporate items 

unallocated corporate items include corporate overhead expenses variances to planned domestic employee benefits and incentives contributions to the general mills foundation and other items that are not part of our measurement of segment operating performance this includes gains and losses from marktomarket valuation of certain commodity positions until passed back to our operating segments in accordance with our policy as discussed in note 2 of the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

for fiscal 2014 unallocated corporate expense totaled 196 million compared to 326 million last year in fiscal 2014 we recorded a 49 million net decrease in expense related to marktomarket valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories compared to a 4 million net decrease in expense last year compensation and benefit expenses decreased 59 million and the contribution to the general mills foundation decreased in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 in fiscal 2013 we also recorded 12 million of integration costs related to the acquisition of yoki

impact of inflation 

we have experienced significant input cost volatility for several years our gross margin performance in fiscal 2014 reflects the impact of 4 percent input cost inflation primarily on commodities inputs we expect input cost inflation of 3 percent in fiscal 2015 we attempt to minimize the effects of inflation through hmm planning and operating practices our risk management practices are discussed in item 7a of this report 

the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 collectively the act was signed into law in march 2010 the act codifies health care reforms with staggered effective dates from 2010 to 2018 many provisions in the act require the issuance of additional guidance from various government agencies because the act does not take effect fully until future years the act did not have a material impact on our fiscal 2014 2013 or 2012 results of operations estimates of the future impacts of several of the act’s provisions are incorporated into our postretirement benefit liability the act may also impact our future health care benefit related expenses given the complexity of the act the extended time period over which the reforms will be implemented and the unknown impact of future regulatory guidance the full impact of the act on future periods will not be known until those regulations are adopted 

liquidity 

the primary source of our liquidity is cash flow from operations over the most recent threeyear period our operations have generated 79 billion in cash a substantial portion of this operating cash flow has been returned to stockholders through share repurchases and dividends we also use cash from operations to fund our capital expenditures and acquisitions we typically use a combination of cash notes payable and longterm debt to finance significant acquisitions and major capital expansions 

  

as of may 25 2014 we had 840 million of cash and cash equivalents held in foreign jurisdictions which will be used to fund foreign operations and acquisitions there is currently no need to repatriate these funds in order to meet domestic funding obligations or scheduled cash distributions if we choose to repatriate cash held in foreign jurisdictions we intend to do so only in a taxneutral manner 

cash flows from operations 

 

 in fiscal 2014 our operations generated 25 billion of cash compared to 29 billion in fiscal 2013 the 385 million decrease is primarily due a 503 million change in current assets and liabilities the change in current assets and liabilities is primarily driven by a 403 million change in other current liabilities largely due to changes in trade promotion and income tax accruals and a 107 million change in inventory in addition in fiscal 2013 we made a 200 million voluntary contribution to our principal domestic pension plans 

we strive to grow core working capital at or below the rate of growth in our net sales for fiscal 2014 core working capital decreased 9 percent compared to net sales growth of 1 percent primarily due to an increase in accounts payable in fiscal 2013 core working capital decreased 5 percent compared to net sales growth of 7 percent and in fiscal 2012 core working capital decreased 7 percent compared to net sales growth of 12 percent 

in fiscal 2013 our operations generated 29 billion of cash compared to 24 billion in fiscal 2012 the 519 million increase is primarily due to a 303 million increase in net earnings and 227 million from changes in current assets and liabilities other current liabilities accounted for 336 million of the increase in current assets and liabilities due to trade and tax accruals and accounts payable accounted for 252 million of the increase partly as the result of the extension of payment terms these were partially offset by a 214 million change in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily due to changes in derivative receivables and changes in other receivables related to the liquidation of a corporate investment and a 126 million change in inventory largely driven by a lower level of inventory reduction activity compared to fiscal 2012 in both fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 we made a 200 million voluntary contribution to our principal domestic pension plans in addition we paid 80 million in cash related to restructuring actions in fiscal 2013 

  

cash flows from investing activities 

 

 in fiscal 2014 cash used by investing activities decreased by 954 million from fiscal 2013 we invested 664 million in land buildings and equipment in fiscal 2014 50 million more than the same period last year we made 55 million of investments in affiliates primarily cpw in fiscal 2014 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 we sold certain grain elevators for approximately 122 million in cash subject to a working capital adjustment in addition we received 29 million in payments from sodiaal international sodiaal in fiscal 2014 against the 132 million exchangeable note we purchased in 2012 

in fiscal 2013 cash used by investing activities decreased by 355 million from fiscal 2012 in fiscal 2013 we acquired yoki a privately held food company headquartered in sao bernardo do campo brazil for an aggregate purchase price of 940 million comprised of 820 million of cash net of 31 million of cash acquired and 120 million of noncash consideration for debt assumed we invested 614 million in land buildings and equipment in fiscal 2013 62 million less than the same period in fiscal 2012 in addition we received 16 million in payments from sodiaal in fiscal 2013 against the 132 million exchangeable note 

we expect capital expenditures to be approximately 730 million in fiscal 2015 these expenditures will support initiatives that are expected to fuel international growth increase manufacturing capacity for snacks and continue hmm initiatives throughout the supply chain 

cash flows from financing activities 

 

   

net cash used by financing activities increased by 684 million in fiscal 2014 we had 387 million more net debt issuances in fiscal 2014 than the same period a year ago for more information on our debt issuances please refer to note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

during fiscal 2014 we received 108 million in proceeds from common stock issued on exercised options compared to 301 million in fiscal 2013 a decrease of 193 million during fiscal 2012 we received 234 million in proceeds from common stock issued on exercised options 

in june 2010 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 100 million shares of our common stock the board terminated this authorization in may 2014 and approved a new authorization for the repurchase of up to 100 million shares of our common stock purchases under the authorization can be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions including the use of call options and other derivative instruments rule 10b51 trading plans and accelerated repurchase programs the authorization has no specified termination date 

during fiscal 2014 we paid 1745 million to repurchase 36 million shares of our common stock during fiscal 2013 we repurchased 24 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 1015 million including 6 million shares with a fair value of 270 million purchased as part of an accelerated share repurchase asr agreement under the terms of this agreement we also paid an additional 30 million to the unrelated financial institution for shares which were settled in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 during fiscal 2012 we repurchased 8 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 313 million 

dividends paid in fiscal 2014 totaled 983 million or 155 per share a 17 percent per share increase from fiscal 2013 dividends paid in fiscal 2013 totaled 868 million or 132 per share an 8 percent per share increase from fiscal 2012 dividends of 122 per share on march 11 2014 our board of directors approved a dividend increase effective with the may 1 2014 payment to an annual rate of 164 per share a 6 percent increase from the rate paid in fiscal 2014 

selected cash flows from joint ventures 

selected cash flows from our joint ventures are set forth in the following table 

 

 capital resources 

total capital consisted of the following 

 

   

the following table details the feepaid committed and uncommitted credit lines we had available as of may 25 2014 

 

 to ensure availability of funds we maintain bank credit lines sufficient to cover our outstanding shortterm borrowings commercial paper is a continuing source of shortterm financing we have commercial paper programs available to us in the united states and europe we also have uncommitted and assetbacked credit lines that support our foreign operations the credit facilities contain several covenants including a requirement to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 25 times 

certain of our longterm debt agreements our credit facilities and our noncontrolling interests contain restrictive covenants as of may 25 2014 we were in compliance with all of these covenants 

we have 1251 million of longterm debt maturing in the next 12 months that is classified as current we believe that cash flows from operations together with available short and longterm debt financing will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for at least the next 12 months 

as of may 25 2014 our total debt including the impact of derivative instruments designated as hedges was 71 percent in fixedrate and 29 percent in floatingrate instruments compared to 73 percent in fixedrate and 27 percent in floatingrate instruments on may 26 2013 the change in the fixedrate and floatingrate percentages was driven by increased commercial paper issuances 

growth in return on average total capital is one of our key performance measures see the “nongaap measures” section below for our discussion of this measure which is not defined by gaap return on average total capital decreased from 120 percent in fiscal 2013 to 116 percent in fiscal 2014 as fiscal 2014 earnings did not grow in line with our capital base we also believe that our fixed charge coverage ratio and the ratio of operating cash flow to debt are important measures of our financial strength our fixed charge coverage ratio in fiscal 2014 was 804 compared to 762 in fiscal 2013 the measure increased from fiscal 2013 as earnings before income taxes and aftertax earnings from joint ventures increased by 120 million and fixed charges decreased by 10 million driven primarily by lower interest our operating cash flow to debt ratio decreased 78 percentage points to 289 percent in fiscal 2014 driven by an increase in total debt 

we have a 51 percent controlling interest in yoplait sas and a 50 percent interest in yoplait marques sas and liberté marques sarl sodiaal holds the remaining interests in each of these entities we consolidate these entities into our consolidated financial statements we record sodiaal’s 50 percent interest in yoplait marques sas and liberté marques sarl as noncontrolling interests and their 49 percent interest in yoplait sas as a redeemable interest on our consolidated balance sheets these euro and canadian dollardenominated interests are reported in us dollars on our consolidated balance sheets sodiaal has the ability to put a limited portion of its redeemable interest to us at fair value once per year up to a maximum remaining term of 6 years as of may 25 2014 the redemption value of the redeemable interest was 984 million which approximates its fair value 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2013 in conjunction with the consent of the class a investor we restructured general mills cereals llc gmc through the distribution of its manufacturing assets stock inventory cash and certain intellectual property to a wholly owned subsidiary gmc retained the remaining intellectual property immediately following the restructuring the class a interests of gmc were sold by the then current holder to another unrelated thirdparty investor 

  

the thirdparty holder of the gmc class a interests receives quarterly preferred distributions from available net income based on the application of a floating preferred return rate currently equal to the sum of threemonth libor plus 110 basis points to the holder’s capital account balance established in the most recent marktomarket valuation currently 252 million the preferred return rate is adjusted every three years through a negotiated agreement with the class a interest holder or through a remarketing auction 

the holder of the class a interests may initiate a liquidation of gmc under certain circumstances including without limitation the bankruptcy of gmc or its subsidiaries gmc’s failure to deliver the preferred distributions on the class a interests gmc’s failure to comply with portfolio requirements breaches of certain covenants lowering of our senior debt rating below either baa3 by moody’s or bbb by standard  poor’s and a failed attempt to remarket the class a interests in the event of a liquidation of gmc each member of gmc will receive the amount of its then current capital account balance we may avoid liquidation by exercising our option to purchase the class a interests 

we may exercise our option to purchase the class a interests for consideration equal to the then current capital account value plus any unpaid preferred return and the prescribed makewhole amount if we purchase these interests any change in the unrelated thirdparty investor’s capital account from its original value will be charged directly to retained earnings and will increase or decrease the net earnings used to calculate eps in that period 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

as of may 25 2014 we have issued guarantees and comfort letters of 341 million for the debt and other obligations of consolidated subsidiaries and guarantees and comfort letters of 284 million for the debt and other obligations of nonconsolidated affiliates mainly cpw in addition offbalance sheet arrangements are generally limited to the future payments under noncancelable operating leases which totaled 388 million as of may 25 2014 

as of may 25 2014 we had invested in five variable interest entities vies none of our vies are material to our results of operations financial condition or liquidity as of and for the year ended may 25 2014 

our defined benefit plans in the united states are subject to the requirements of the pension protection act ppa the ppa revised the basis and methodology for determining defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements as well as maximum contributions to and benefits paid from taxqualified plans the ppa may ultimately require us to make additional contributions to our domestic plans we do not expect to be required to make any contributions in fiscal 2015 

  

the following table summarizes our future estimated cash payments under existing contractual obligations including payments due by period 

 

     significant accounting estimates 

for a complete description of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report our significant accounting estimates are those that have a meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations these estimates include our accounting for promotional expenditures valuation of longlived assets intangible assets redeemable interest stockbased compensation income taxes and defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefits 

promotional expenditures 

our promotional activities are conducted through our customers and directly or indirectly with end consumers these activities include payments to customers to perform merchandising activities on our behalf such as advertising or instore displays discounts to our list prices to lower retail shelf prices payments to gain distribution of new products coupons contests and other incentives and media and advertising expenditures the recognition of these costs requires estimation of customer participation and performance levels these estimates are made based on the forecasted customer sales the timing and forecasted costs of promotional activities and other factors differences between estimated expenses and actual costs are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period our accrued trade coupon and consumer marketing liabilities were 578 million as of may 25 2014 and 635 million as of may 26 2013 because our total promotional expenditures including amounts classified as a reduction of revenues are significant if our estimates are inaccurate we would have to make adjustments in subsequent periods that could have a material effect on our results of operations 

  

valuation of longlived assets 

we estimate the useful lives of longlived assets and make estimates concerning undiscounted cash flows to review for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent appraisals as appropriate 

intangible assets 

goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization and are tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred our estimates of fair value for goodwill impairment testing are determined based on a discounted cash flow model we use inputs from our longrange planning process to determine growth rates for sales and profits we also make estimates of discount rates perpetuity growth assumptions market comparables and other factors 

we evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets mainly brands to determine if they are finite or indefinitelived reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry known technological advances legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets intangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized on a straightline basis over their useful lives generally ranging from 4 to 30 years our estimate of the fair value of our brand assets is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs which include projected revenues from our longrange plan assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands and a discount rate 

as of may 25 2014 we had 131 billion of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets our europe and yoplait us reporting units and uncle toby’s and mountain high brands have experienced declining business performance and we will continue to monitor these businesses while we currently believe that the fair value of each intangible exceeds its carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses or a different weightedaverage cost of capital could result in significant impairment losses and amortization expense we performed our fiscal 2014 assessment of our intangible assets as of november 25 2013 as of our annual assessment date there was no impairment of any of our intangible assets as their related fair values were substantially in excess of the carrying values except for the uncle toby’s brand which had a fair value 8 percent greater than its carrying value of 63 million in addition our mountain high brand had a fair value 23 percent greater than its carrying value of 35 million 

redeemable interest 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2014 we adjusted the redemption value of sodiaal’s redeemable interest in yoplait sas based on a discounted cash flow model the significant assumptions used to estimate the redemption value include projected revenue growth and profitability from our longrange plan capital spending depreciation and taxes foreign currency rates and a discount rate as of may 25 2014 the redemption value of the redeemable interest was 984 million 

stockbased compensation 

the valuation of stock options is a significant accounting estimate that requires us to use judgments and assumptions that are likely to have a material impact on our financial statements annually we make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility employee exercise behavior dividend yield and the forfeiture rate for more information on these assumptions please refer to note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

  

the estimated fair values of stock options granted and the assumptions used for the blackscholes optionpricing model were as follows 

 

 the riskfree interest rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based on the us treasury zerocoupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant an increase in the expected term by 1 year leaving all other assumptions constant would increase the grant date fair value by 2 percent if all other assumptions are held constant a one percentage point increase in our fiscal 2014 volatility assumption would increase the grant date fair value of our fiscal 2014 option awards by 7 percent 

to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our assumptions we are not required to true up grantdate fair valuebased expense to final intrinsic values however these differences can impact the classification of cash tax benefits realized upon exercise of stock options as explained in the following two paragraphs furthermore historical data has a significant bearing on our forwardlooking assumptions significant variances between actual and predicted experience could lead to prospective revisions in our assumptions which could then significantly impact the yearoveryear comparability of stockbased compensation expense 

any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings referred to as a windfall tax benefit is presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows as a financing cash flow the actual impact on future years’ financing cash flows will depend in part on the volume of employee stock option exercises during a particular year and the relationship between the exercisedate market value of the underlying stock and the original grantdate fair value previously determined for financial reporting purposes 

realized windfall tax benefits are credited to additional paidin capital within the consolidated balance sheets realized shortfall tax benefits amounts which are less than that previously recognized in earnings are first offset against the cumulative balance of windfall tax benefits if any and then charged directly to income tax expense potentially resulting in volatility in our consolidated effective income tax rate we calculated a cumulative amount of windfall tax benefits for the purpose of accounting for future shortfall tax benefits and currently have sufficient cumulative windfall tax benefits to absorb projected arising shortfalls such that we do not currently expect future earnings to be affected by this provision however as employee stock option exercise behavior is not within our control it is possible that materially different reported results could occur if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail 

income taxes 

we apply a morelikelythannot threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions accordingly we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement future changes in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect earnings in the quarter of such change for more information on income taxes please refer to note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plans 

we have defined benefit pension plans covering most employees in the united states canada france and the united kingdom we also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to the majority of our retirees in the united states canada and brazil under certain circumstances we also provide accruable benefits to former or inactive employees in the united states canada and mexico and members of our board of directors including severance and certain other benefits payable upon death please refer to note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in 

  

item 8 to this report for a description of our defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plans 

we recognize benefits provided during retirement or following employment over the plan participants’ active working lives accordingly we make various assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement of our obligations assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our net periodic benefit expense or income and accumulated benefit obligations include the longterm rates of return on plan assets the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our benefit plans and the health care cost trend rates 

expected rate of return on plan assets 

our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation our historical longterm investment performance our estimate of future longterm returns by asset class using input from our actuaries investment services and investment managers and longterm inflation assumptions we review this assumption annually for each plan however our annual investment performance for one particular year does not by itself significantly influence our evaluation 

our historical investment returns compound annual growth rates for our united states defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets were 153 percent 139 percent 92 percent 84 percent and 99 percent for the 1 5 10 15 and 20 year periods ended may 25 2014 

on a weightedaverage basis the expected rate of return for all defined benefit plans was 853 percent for fiscal 2014 853 percent for fiscal 2013 and 952 percent for fiscal 2012 

lowering the expected longterm rate of return on assets by 100 basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense by 59 million for fiscal 2015 a marketrelated valuation basis is used to reduce yeartoyear expense volatility the marketrelated valuation recognizes certain investment gains or losses over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the marketrelated value of assets and the actual return based on the marketrelated value of assets our outside actuaries perform these calculations as part of our determination of annual expense or income

our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of the last day of our fiscal year for our defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plan obligations we work with our outside actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan participants and using the aa above median corporate bond yield to develop a forward interest rate curve including a margin to that index based on our credit risk this forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions 

our weightedaverage discount rates were as follows 

 

 lowering the discount rates by 100 basis points would increase our net defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plan expense for fiscal 2015 by approximately 96 million all obligationrelated experience gains and losses are amortized using a straightline method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants 

  

health care cost trend rates 

we review our health care cost trend rates annually our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims experience and information provided by our actuaries this information includes recent plan experience plan design overall industry experience and projections and assumptions used by other similar organizations our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with this review recent experiences and shortterm expectations our initial health care cost trend rate assumption is 73 percent for retirees age 65 and over and 65 percent for retirees under age 65 at the end of fiscal 2014 rates are graded down annually until the ultimate trend rate of 50 percent is reached in 2025 for all retirees the trend rates are applicable for calculations only if the retirees’ benefits increase as a result of health care inflation the ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually as necessary to approximate the current economic view on the rate of longterm inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium assumed trend rates for health care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans 

a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate would have the following effects 

 

 any arising health care claims costrelated experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculation of expected future claims once recognized experience gains and losses are amortized using a straightline method over 15 years resulting in at least the minimum amortization required being recorded 

financial statement impact 

in fiscal 2014 we recorded net defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plan expense of 140 million compared to 159 million of expense in fiscal 2013 and 106 million of expense in fiscal 2012 as of may 25 2014 we had cumulative unrecognized actuarial net losses of 14 billion on our defined benefit pension plans and 80 million on our postretirement and postemployment benefit plans mainly as the result of liability increases from lower interest rates partially offset by recent increases in the values of plan assets these unrecognized actuarial net losses will result in increases in our future pension expense and increases in postretirement expense since they currently exceed the corridors defined by gaap 

we use the 2014 irs static mortality table projected forward to our plans’ measurement dates to calculate the yearend defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit obligations and annual expense 

actual future net defined benefit pension other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plan income or expense will depend on investment performance changes in future discount rates changes in health care cost trend rates and other factors related to the populations participating in these plans 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board issued new accounting requirements for the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers the requirements of the new standard are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2018 we do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 

  

nongaap measures 

we have included in this report measures of financial performance that are not defined by gaap we believe that these measures provide useful information to investors and include these measures in other communications to investors 

for each of these nongaap financial measures we are providing below a reconciliation of the differences between the nongaap measure and the most directly comparable gaap measure an explanation of why our management or the board of directors believes the nongaap measure provides useful information to investors and any additional purposes for which our management or board of directors uses the nongaap measure these nongaap measures should be viewed in addition to and not in lieu of the comparable gaap measure 

international segment operating profit excluding the impact of venezuela currency devaluation 

this measure is used in reporting to our executive management and as a component of the board of director’s measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes we believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it provides transparency to the underlying performance of the international segment by excluding the volatility related to the remeasurement of our venezuelan subsidiary’s balance sheet a reconciliation of this measure to international segment operating profit follows 

 

 total segment operating profit excluding the impact of venezuela currency devaluation 

this measure is used in reporting to our executive management and as a component of the board of director’s measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes we believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it provides transparency to underlying segment performance by excluding the volatility related to the remeasurement of our venezuelan subsidiary’s balance sheet a reconciliation of this measure to operating profit the relevant gaap measure follows 

 

   

diluted eps excluding certain items affecting comparability 

this measure is used in reporting to our executive management and as a component of the board of director’s measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes we believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is the profitability measure we use to evaluate earnings performance on a comparable yearoveryear basis the adjustments are either items resulting from infrequently occurring events or items that in management’s judgment significantly affect the yearoveryear assessment of operating results 

the reconciliation of diluted eps excluding certain items affecting comparability to diluted eps the relevant gaap measure follows 

 

         

return on average total capital 

this measure is used in reporting to our executive management and as a component of the board of director’s measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes we believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is important for assessing the utilization of capital and it eliminates certain items which affect yeartoyear comparability 

 

    

net sales growth rates for our international segment excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange 

we believe that this measure of our international segment and region net sales provides useful information to investors because it provides transparency to the underlying performance in markets outside the united states by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on yeartoyear comparability 

to present this information current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than united states dollars are translated into united states dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year rather than the actual average exchange rates in effect during the current fiscal year therefore the foreign currency impact is equal to current year results in local currencies multiplied by the change in the average foreign currency exchange rate between the current fiscal period and the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates and commodity and equity prices changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows in the normal course of business we actively manage our exposure to these market risks by entering into various hedging transactions authorized under established policies that place clear controls on these activities the counterparties in these transactions are generally highly rated institutions we establish credit limits for each counterparty our hedging transactions include but are not limited to a variety of derivative financial instruments for information on interest rate foreign exchange commodity price and equity instrument risk please see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

value at risk 

the estimates in the table below are intended to measure the maximum potential fair value we could lose in one day from adverse changes in market interest rates foreign exchange rates commodity prices and equity prices under normal market conditions a monte carlo valueatrisk var methodology was used to quantify the market risk for our exposures the models assumed normal market conditions and used a 95 percent confidence level 

  

the var calculation used historical interest and foreign exchange rates and commodity and equity prices from the past year to estimate the potential volatility and correlation of these rates in the future the market data were drawn from the riskmetrics™ data set the calculations are not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that we expect to incur further since the hedging instrument the derivative inversely correlates with the underlying exposure we would expect that any loss or gain in the fair value of our derivatives would be generally offset by an increase or decrease in the fair value of the underlying exposure the positions included in the calculations were debt investments interest rate swaps foreign exchange forwards commodity swaps futures and options and equity instruments the calculations do not include the underlying foreign exchange and commodities or equityrelated positions that are offset by these marketrisksensitive instruments 

the table below presents the estimated maximum potential var arising from a oneday loss in fair value for our interest rate foreign currency commodity and equity marketrisksensitive instruments outstanding as of may 25 2014 and may 26 2013 and the average fair value impact during the year ended may 25 2014

seasonality 

in general demand for our products is evenly balanced throughout the year however within our us retail segment demand for refrigerated dough frozen baked goods and baking products is stronger in the fourth calendar quarter demand for progresso soup and green giant canned and frozen vegetables is higher during the fall and winter months internationally demand for häagendazs ice cream is higher during the summer months and demand for baking mix and dough products increases during winter months due to the offsetting impact of these demand trends as well as the different seasons in the northern and southern hemispheres our international segment net sales are generally evenly balanced throughout the year 

backlog 

orders are generally filled within a few days of receipt and are subject to cancellation at any time prior to shipment the backlog of any unfilled orders as of may 26 2013 was not material

food quality and safety regulation 

the manufacture and sale of consumer food products is highly regulated in the united states our activities are subject to regulation by various federal government agencies including the food and drug administration department of agriculture federal trade commission department of commerce and environmental protection agency as well as various state and local agencies our business is also regulated by similar agencies outside of the united states 

environmental matters 

as of may 26 2013 we were involved with three active cleanup sites associated with the alleged or threatened release of hazardous substances or wastes located in sauget illinois minneapolis minnesota and moonachie new jersey these matters involve several different actions including administrative proceedings commenced by regulatory agencies and demand letters by regulatory agencies and private parties 

we recognize that our potential exposure with respect to any of these sites may be joint and several but have concluded that our probable aggregate exposure is not material to our consolidated financial position or cash flows from operations this conclusion is based upon among other things our payments and accruals with respect to each site the number ranking and financial strength of other potentially responsible parties the status of the proceedings including various settlement agreements consent decrees or court orders allocations of volumetric waste contributions and allocations of relative responsibility among potentially responsible parties developed by regulatory agencies and by private parties remediation cost estimates prepared by governmental authorities or private technical consultants and our historical experience in negotiating and settling disputes with respect to similar sites 

our operations are subject to the clean air act clean water act resource conservation and recovery act comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act and all similar state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations applicable to the jurisdictions in which we operate 

based on current facts and circumstances we believe that neither the results of our environmental proceedings nor our compliance in general with environmental laws or regulations will have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position

 item 1a risk factors tableend our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties any of the risks described below could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the food categories in which we participate are very competitive and if we are not able to compete effectively our results of operations could be adversely affected 

the food categories in which we participate are very competitive our principal competitors in these categories all have substantial financial marketing and other resources in most product categories we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products but also with generic and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices competition in our product categories is based on product innovation product quality price brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing promotional activity and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences if our large competitors were to seek an advantage through pricing or promotional changes we could choose to do the same which could adversely affect our margins and profitability if we did not do the same our revenues and market share could be adversely affected our market share and revenue growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing innovative products in response to changing consumer demands or by new product introductions of our competitors if we are unable to build and sustain brand equity by offering recognizably superior product quality we may be unable to maintain premium pricing over generic and private label products 

we may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face of a consolidating retail environment 

during fiscal 2013 walmart stores inc and its affiliates walmart accounted for 21 percent of our consolidated net sales and 31 percent of our net sales in the us retail segment no other customer accounted for 10 percent or more of our consolidated net sales walmart also represented 6 percent of our net sales in the international segment and 7 percent of our net sales in the bakeries and foodservice segment the five largest customers in our us retail segment accounted for 54 percent of its net sales for fiscal 2013 the five largest customers in our international segment accounted for 24 percent of its net sales for fiscal 2013 and the five largest customers in our bakeries and foodservice segment accounted for 41 percent of its net sales for fiscal 2013 the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could adversely affect our sales and profits in addition large retail customers may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency lower pricing increased reliance on their own brand name products increased emphasis on generic and other economy brands and increased promotional programs if we are unable to use our scale marketing expertise product innovation knowledge of consumers’ needs and category leadership positions to respond to these demands our profitability or volume growth could be negatively impacted 

  

price changes for the commodities we depend on for raw materials packaging and energy may adversely affect our profitability 

the principal raw materials that we use are commodities that experience price volatility caused by external conditions such as weather product scarcity limited sources of supply commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations commodity price changes may result in unexpected increases in raw material packaging and energy costs if we are unable to increase productivity to offset these increased costs or increase our prices we may experience reduced margins and profitability we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and the risk management procedures that we do use may not always work as we intend 

volatility in the market value of derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices will cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings 

we utilize derivatives to manage price risk for some of our principal ingredient and energy costs including grains oats wheat and corn oils principally soybean nonfat dry milk natural gas and diesel fuel changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded in earnings currently resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings these gains and losses are reported in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of earnings and in unallocated corporate items in our segment operating results until we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating profit we also record our grain inventories at fair value we may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments 

if we are not efficient in our production our profitability could suffer as a result of the highly competitive environment in which we operate 

our future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to be efficient in the production and manufacture of our products in highly competitive markets gaining additional efficiencies may become more difficult over time our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or by eliminating redundant costs resulting from acquisitions could adversely affect our profitability and weaken our competitive position many productivity initiatives involve complex reorganization of manufacturing facilities and production lines such manufacturing realignment may result in the interruption of production which may negatively impact product volume and margins 

disruption of our supply chain could adversely affect our business 

our ability to make move and sell products is critical to our success damage or disruption to raw material supplies or our manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather including any potential effects of climate change natural disaster fire terrorism pandemic strikes import restrictions or other factors could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or to effectively manage such events if they occur particularly when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location could adversely affect our business and results of operations as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain 

concerns with the safety and quality of food products could cause consumers to avoid certain food products or ingredients 

we could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients adverse publicity about these types of concerns whether or not valid may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions 

  

if our food products become adulterated misbranded or mislabeled we might need to recall those items and may experience product liability claims if consumers are injured 

we may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated misbranded or mislabeled a widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time we could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us a significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity damage to our reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in our food products which could have an adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands 

we may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and trends which may result in decreased demand for our products 

our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes and eating habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences consumer preferences change from time to time and can be affected by a number of different trends our failure to anticipate identify or react to these changes and trends or to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis could result in reduced demand for our products which would in turn cause our revenues and profitability to suffer similarly demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns regarding the health effects of ingredients such as sodium trans fats sugar processed wheat or other product ingredients or attributes 

we may be unable to grow our market share or add products that are in faster growing and more profitable categories 

the food industry’s growth potential is constrained by population growth our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business faster than populations are growing in the markets that we serve one way to achieve that growth is to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new products in faster growing and more profitable categories our future results will also depend on our ability to increase market share in our existing product categories if we do not succeed in developing innovative products for new and existing categories our growth may slow which could adversely affect our profitability 

economic downturns could limit consumer demand for our products 

the willingness of consumers to purchase our products depends in part on local economic conditions in periods of economic uncertainty consumers may purchase more generic private label and other economy brands and may forego certain purchases altogether in those circumstances we could experience a reduction in sales of higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings in addition as a result of economic conditions or competitive actions we may be unable to raise our prices sufficiently to protect margins consumers may also reduce the amount of food that they consume away from home at customers that purchase products from our bakeries and foodservice segment any of these events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

our international operations are subject to political and economic risks 

in fiscal 2013 29 percent of our consolidated net sales were generated outside of the united states we are accordingly subject to a number of risks relating to doing business internationally any of which could significantly harm our business these risks include 

 

      our financial performance on a us dollar denominated basis is subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates these fluctuations could cause material variations in our results of operations our principal exposures are to the australian dollar brazilian real british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese renminbi euro japanese yen mexican peso and swiss franc from time to time we enter into agreements that are intended to reduce the effects of our exposure to currency fluctuations but these agreements may not be effective in significantly reducing our exposure 

  

new regulations or regulatorybased claims could adversely affect our business 

food production and marketing are highly regulated by a variety of federal state local and foreign agencies changes in laws or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements on us including regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could increase our cost of doing business or restrict our actions causing our results of operations to be adversely affected in addition we advertise our products and could be the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal state and foreign laws and regulations we may also be subject to new laws or regulations restricting our right to advertise our products including proposals to limit advertising to children 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could limit financing and other options and in some cases adversely affect our ability to pay dividends 

as of may 26 2013 we had total debt redeemable interests and noncontrolling interests of 94 billion the agreements under which we have issued indebtedness do not prevent us from incurring additional unsecured indebtedness in the future our level of indebtedness may limit our 

 

  there are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments and noncontrolling interests if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the related indebtedness and other unrelated indebtedness could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity and our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing may also be adversely affected 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt and other obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control 

global capital and credit market issues could negatively affect our liquidity increase our costs of borrowing and disrupt the operations of our suppliers and customers 

we depend on stable liquid and wellfunctioning capital and credit markets to fund our operations although we believe that our operating cash flows financial assets access to capital and credit markets and revolvingcredit agreements will permit us to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future there can be no assurance that future volatility or disruption in the capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing our business could also be negatively impacted if our suppliers or customers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy 

volatility in the securities markets interest rates and other factors or changes in our employee base could substantially increase our defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefit costs 

we sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the united states canada and various foreign locations including defined benefit pension retiree health and welfare severance directors’ life and other postemployment plans our major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments changes in interest rates mortality rates health care costs early retirement rates investment returns and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plans a significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations 

  

our business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately 

the efficient operation of our business depends on our information technology systems we rely on our information technology systems to effectively manage our business data communications supply chain order entry and fulfillment and other business processes the failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in transaction errors processing inefficiencies and the loss of sales and customers causing our business and results of operations to suffer in addition our information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control including fire natural disasters systems failures security breaches and viruses any such damage or interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business 

if other potentially responsible parties prps are unable to contribute to remediation costs at certain contaminated sites our costs for remediation could be material 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign environmental and health and safety laws and regulations under certain of these laws namely the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and its state counterparts liability for investigation and remediation of hazardous substance contamination at currently or formerly owned or operated facilities or at thirdparty waste disposal sites is joint and several we currently are involved in active remediation efforts at certain sites where we have been named a prp if other prps at these sites are unable to contribute to remediation costs we could be held responsible for their portion of the remediation costs and those costs could be material we cannot assure that our costs in relation to these environmental matters or compliance with environmental laws in general will not exceed our established liabilities or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

a change in the assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses or a different weightedaverage cost of capital used to value our reporting units or our indefinitelived intangible assets could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth 

goodwill for each of our reporting units is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred we compare the carrying value of the net assets of a reporting unit including goodwill to the fair value of the unit if the fair value of the net assets of the reporting unit is less than the net assets including goodwill impairment has occurred our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our annual longrange planning process we also make estimates of discount rates perpetuity growth assumptions market comparables and other factors while we currently believe that our goodwill is not impaired different assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses could result in significant impairment losses 

we evaluate the useful lives of our intangible assets primarily intangible assets associated with the pillsbury  totino’s  progresso  green giant  yoplait  old el paso  yoki  and häagendazs brands to determine if they are finite or indefinitelived reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry known technological advances legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 

our indefinitelived intangible assets are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable our estimate of the fair value of the brands is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs including projected revenues from our annual longrange plan assumed royalty rates which could be payable if we did not own the brands and a discount rate 

as of may 26 2013 we had 131 billion of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets while we currently believe that the fair value of each intangible exceeds its carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses or a different weightedaverage cost of capital could result in significant impairment losses and amortization expense 

  

our failure to successfully integrate acquisitions into our existing operations could adversely affect our financial results 

from time to time we evaluate potential acquisitions or joint ventures that would further our strategic objectives our success depends in part upon our ability to integrate acquired and existing operations if we are unable to successfully integrate acquisitions our financial results could suffer additional potential risks associated with acquisitions include additional debt leverage the loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business the assumption of unknown liabilities the inherent risk associated with entering a geographic area or line of business in which we have no or limited prior experience failure to achieve anticipated synergies and the impairment of goodwill or other acquisitionrelated intangible assets

our consolidated effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 was 292 percent compared to 321 percent in fiscal 2012 the 29 percentage point decrease was primarily related to the restructuring of our general mills cereals llc gmc subsidiary during the first quarter of fiscal 2013 which resulted in a 63 million decrease to deferred income tax liabilities related to the tax basis of the investment in gmc and certain distributed assets with a corresponding discrete noncash reduction to income taxes during fiscal 2013 we also recorded a 34 million discrete decrease in income tax expense and an increase in our deferred tax assets related to certain actions taken to restore part of the tax benefits associated with medicare part d subsidies which had previously been reduced in fiscal 2010 with the enactment of the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 our fiscal 2013 tax expense also includes a 12 million charge associated with the liquidation of a corporate investment 

aftertax earnings from joint ventures for fiscal 2013 increased to 99 million compared to 88 million in fiscal 2012 primarily due to higher tax rates in fiscal 2012 as a result of discrete tax items and higher operating profit offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange in fiscal 2013

gross margin grew 2 percent in fiscal 2012 versus fiscal 2011 gross margin as a percent of net sales decreased by 370 basis points from fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2012 this decrease was primarily driven by higher input costs and losses from marktomarket valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories in fiscal 2012 versus gains in fiscal 2011

our consolidated effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 was 321 percent compared to 297 percent in fiscal 2011 the 24 percentage point increase was primarily due to a 100 million reduction to tax expense recorded in fiscal 2011 related to a settlement with the internal revenue service irs concerning corporate income tax adjustments for fiscal years 2002 to 2008 

  

aftertax earnings from joint ventures for fiscal 2012 decreased to 88 million compared to 96 million in fiscal 2011 primarily due to higher effective tax rates as a result of discrete tax items in fiscal 2012

during fiscal 2010 venezuela became a highly inflationary economy in february 2013 the venezuelan government devalued the bolivar by resetting the official exchange rate the effect of the devaluation in fiscal 2013 was a 25 million foreign exchange loss in segment operating profit resulting from the remeasurement of assets and liabilities of our venezuelan subsidiary we continue to use the official exchange rate to remeasure the financial statements of our venezuelan operations as we expect to remit dividends through transactions at the official rate we do not expect that the effects of the devaluation will have a material impact on our results in the future

in fiscal 2012 segment operating profit was 287 million down 6 percent from 306 million in fiscal 2011 the decrease was primarily driven by lower grain merchandising earnings

impact of inflation 

we have experienced significant input cost volatility since fiscal 2006 our gross margin performance in fiscal 2013 reflects the impact of 3 percent input cost inflation primarily on commodities inputs we expect the rate of inflation of commodities and energy costs to be consistent in fiscal 2014 we attempt to minimize the effects of inflation through planning and operating practices our risk management practices are discussed in item 7a of this report 

  

the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 collectively the act was signed into law in march 2010 the act codifies health care reforms with staggered effective dates from 2010 to 2018 many provisions in the act require the issuance of additional guidance from various government agencies because the act does not take effect fully until future years the act did not have a material impact on our fiscal 2013 2012 or 2011 results of operations given the complexity of the act the extended time period over which the reforms will be implemented and the unknown impact of future regulatory guidance the full impact of the act on future periods will not be known until those regulations are adopted 

liquidity 

the primary source of our liquidity is cash flow from operations over the most recent threeyear period our operations have generated 69 billion in cash a substantial portion of this operating cash flow has been returned to stockholders through share repurchases and dividends we also use this source of liquidity to fund our capital expenditures and acquisitions we typically use a combination of cash notes payable and longterm debt to finance acquisitions and major capital expansions 

as of may 26 2013 we had 714 million of cash and cash equivalents held in foreign jurisdictions which will be used to fund foreign operations and acquisitions there is currently no need to repatriate these funds in order to meet domestic funding obligations or scheduled cash distributions if we choose to repatriate cash held in foreign jurisdictions we expect to do so only in a taxneutral manner 

cash flows from operations 

 

 in fiscal 2013 our operations generated 29 billion of cash compared to 24 billion in fiscal 2012 the 519 million increase is primarily due to a 303 million increase in net earnings and 227 million from changes in current assets and liabilities other current liabilities accounted for 336 million of the increase in current assets and liabilities due to trade and tax accruals and accounts payable accounted for 252 million of the increase partly as the result of the extension of payment terms these were partially offset by a 214 million change in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily due to changes in derivative receivables and changes in other receivables related to the liquidation of a corporate investment and a 126 million change in inventory largely driven by a lower level of inventory reduction activity compared to fiscal 2012 in both fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 we made a 200 million voluntary contribution to our principal domestic pension plans in addition we paid 80 million in cash related to restructuring actions in fiscal 2013

selected cash flows from joint ventures 

selected cash flows from our joint ventures are set forth in the following table 

 

 capital resources 

total capital consisted of the following 

 

   

the following table details the feepaid committed and uncommitted credit lines we had available as of may 26 2013 

 

 to ensure availability of funds we maintain bank credit lines sufficient to cover our outstanding shortterm borrowings commercial paper is a continuing source of shortterm financing we have commercial paper programs available to us in the united states and europe our commercial paper borrowings are supported by 27 billion of feepaid committed credit lines consisting of a 10 billion facility expiring in april 2015 and a 17 billion facility expiring in april 2017 we also have 333 million in uncommitted credit lines that support our foreign operations as of may 26 2013 there were no amounts outstanding on the feepaid committed credit lines and 84 million was drawn on the uncommitted lines the credit facilities contain several covenants including a requirement to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 25 times 

certain of our longterm debt agreements our credit facilities and our noncontrolling interests contain restrictive covenants as of may 26 2013 we were in compliance with all of these covenants 

we have 1443 million of longterm debt maturing in the next 12 months that is classified as current we believe that cash flows from operations together with available short and longterm debt financing will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for at least the next 12 months 

as of may 26 2013 our total debt including the impact of derivative instruments designated as hedges was 73 percent in fixedrate and 27 percent in floatingrate instruments compared to 71 percent in fixedrate and 29 percent in floatingrate instruments on may 27 2012 the change in the fixedrate and floatingrate percentages was driven by the issuance of fixed rate bonds in january 2013 

growth in return on average total capital is one of our key performance measures see the “nongaap measures” section below for our discussion of this measure which is not defined by gaap return on average total capital decreased from 127 percent in fiscal 2012 to 119 percent in fiscal 2013 primarily reflecting the impact of acquisitions we also believe that our fixed charge coverage ratio and the ratio of operating cash flow to debt are important measures of our financial strength our fixed charge coverage ratio in fiscal 2013 was 762 compared to 626 in fiscal 2012 the measure increased from fiscal 2012 as earnings before income taxes and aftertax earnings from joint ventures increased by 324 million and fixed charges decreased by 32 million driven primarily by lower interest our operating cash flow to debt ratio increased 43 percentage points to 367 percent in fiscal 2013 driven by a higher rate of increase in cash flows from operations than in total debt 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2012 we acquired a 51 percent controlling interest in yoplait sas and a 50 percent interest in yoplait marques sas sodiaal holds the remaining interests in each of the entities we consolidated both entities into our consolidated financial statements at the date of the acquisition we recorded the 264 million fair value of sodiaal’s 50 percent interest in yoplait marques sas as a noncontrolling interest and the 904 million fair value of its 49 percent interest in yoplait sas as a redeemable interest on our consolidated balance sheets these eurodenominated interests are reported in us dollars on our consolidated balance sheets sodiaal has the ability to put a limited portion of its redeemable interest to us at fair value once per year up to a maximum of 9 years as of may 26 2013 the redemption value of the redeemable interest was 968 million which approximates its fair value 

  

during the first quarter of fiscal 2013 in conjunction with the consent of the class a investor we restructured gmc through the distribution of its manufacturing assets stock inventory cash and certain intellectual property to a wholly owned subsidiary gmc retained the remaining intellectual property immediately following the restructuring the class a interests of gmc were sold by the then current holder to another unrelated thirdparty investor 

the thirdparty holder of the gmc class a interests receives quarterly preferred distributions from available net income based on the application of a floating preferred return rate currently equal to the sum of threemonth libor plus 110 basis points to the holder’s capital account balance established in the most recent marktomarket valuation currently 252 million the preferred return rate is adjusted every three years through a negotiated agreement with the class a interest holder or through a remarketing auction 

the holder of the class a interests may initiate a liquidation of gmc under certain circumstances including without limitation the bankruptcy of gmc or its subsidiaries gmc’s failure to deliver the preferred distributions on the class a interests gmc’s failure to comply with portfolio requirements breaches of certain covenants lowering of our senior debt rating below either baa3 by moody’s or bbb by standard  poor’s and a failed attempt to remarket the class a interests in the event of a liquidation of gmc each member of gmc will receive the amount of its then current capital account balance we may avoid liquidation by exercising our option to purchase the class a interests 

we may exercise our option to purchase the class a interests for consideration equal to the then current capital account value plus any unpaid preferred return and the prescribed makewhole amount if we purchase these interests any change in the unrelated thirdparty investor’s capital account from its original value will be charged directly to retained earnings and will increase or decrease the net earnings used to calculate eps in that period 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

as of may 26 2013 we have issued guarantees and comfort letters of 356 million for the debt and other obligations of consolidated subsidiaries and guarantees and comfort letters of 259 million for the debt and other obligations of nonconsolidated affiliates mainly cpw in addition offbalance sheet arrangements are generally limited to the future payments under noncancelable operating leases which totaled 438 million as of may 26 2013 

as of may 26 2013 we had invested in four variable interest entities vies none of our vies are material to our results of operations financial condition or liquidity as of and for the year ended may 26 2013 we determined whether or not we were the primary beneficiary pb of each vie using a qualitative assessment that considered the vie’s purpose and design the involvement of each of the interest holders and the risks and benefits of the vie we are the pb of three of the vies we provided minimal financial or other support to our vies during fiscal 2013 and there are no arrangements related to vies that would require us to provide significant financial support in the future 

our defined benefit plans in the united states are subject to the requirements of the pension protection act ppa the ppa revised the basis and methodology for determining defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements as well as maximum contributions to and benefits paid from taxqualified plans the ppa may ultimately require us to make additional contributions to our domestic plans we made 200 million of voluntary contributions to our principal us plans in each of fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 we do not expect to be required to make any contributions in fiscal 2014 actual fiscal 2014 contributions could exceed our current projections and may be influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts or by changes in regulatory requirements additionally our projections concerning timing of the ppa funding requirements are subject to change and may be influenced by factors such as general market conditions affecting trust asset performance interest rates and our future decisions regarding certain elective provisions of the ppa

for a complete description of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report our significant accounting estimates are those that have a meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations these estimates include our accounting for promotional expenditures valuation of longlived assets intangible assets redeemable interest stockbased compensation income taxes and defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefits 

promotional expenditures 

our promotional activities are conducted through our customers and directly or indirectly with end consumers these activities include payments to customers to perform merchandising activities on our behalf such as advertising or instore displays discounts to our list prices to lower retail shelf prices payments to gain distribution of new products coupons contests and other incentives and media and advertising expenditures the media and advertising expenditures are generally recognized as expense when the advertisement airs the cost of payments to customers and other consumerrelated activities are recognized as the related revenue is recorded which generally precedes the actual cash expenditure the recognition of these costs requires estimation of customer participation and performance levels these estimates are made based on the forecasted customer sales the timing and forecasted costs of promotional activities and other factors differences between estimated expenses and actual costs are normally insignificant and are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period our accrued trade coupon and consumer marketing liabilities were 635 million as of may 26 2013 and 561 million as of 

  

may 27 2012 because our total promotional expenditures including amounts classified as a reduction of revenues are significant if our estimates are inaccurate we would have to make adjustments in subsequent periods that could have a material effect on our results of operations 

valuation of longlived assets 

longlived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the asset group are less than the carrying amount of the asset group asset groups have identifiable cash flows independent of other asset groups measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset or asset group over its fair value fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent appraisals as appropriate 

intangible assets 

goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred impairment testing is performed for each of our reporting units we compare the carrying value of a reporting unit including goodwill to the fair value of the unit carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we revalue all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit excluding goodwill to determine if the fair value of the net assets is greater than the net assets including goodwill if the fair value of the net assets is less than the carrying amount of net assets including goodwill impairment has occurred our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our annual longrange planning process we also make estimates of discount rates perpetuity growth assumptions market comparables and other factors we performed our fiscal 2013 assessment as of november 26 2012 and determined there was no impairment of goodwill for any of our reporting units as their related fair values were substantially in excess of their carrying values 

we evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets mainly brands to determine if they are finite or indefinitelived reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry known technological advances legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets intangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized on a straightline basis over their useful lives generally ranging from 4 to 30 years 

our indefinitelived intangible assets mainly intangible assets primarily associated with the pillsbury  totino’s  progresso  green giant  yoplait  old el paso  yoki  and häagendazs brands are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable we performed our fiscal 2013 assessment of our brand intangibles as of november 26 2012 our estimate of the fair value of the brands was based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs which included projected revenues from our annual longrange plan assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands and a discount rate as of our assessment date there was no impairment of any of our indefinitelived intangible assets as their related fair values were substantially in excess of the carrying values 

as of may 26 2013 we had 131 billion of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets while we currently believe that the fair value of each intangible exceeds its carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses or a different weightedaverage cost of capital could result in significant impairment losses and amortization expense 

in addition we assess our investments in our joint ventures if we have reason to believe an impairment may have occurred including but not limited to ongoing operating losses projected decreases in earnings increases in the weighted average cost of capital or significant business disruptions the significant assumptions used to estimate fair value include revenue growth and profitability royalty rates capital spending depreciation and taxes foreign currency exchange rates and a discount rate by their nature these projections and assumptions are uncertain if we were to determine the current fair value of our investment was less than the carrying value of the investment then we would assess if the shortfall was of a temporary or permanent nature and write down the investment to its fair value if we concluded the impairment is other than temporary 

  

redeemable interest 

on july 1 2011 we acquired a 51 percent controlling interest in yoplait sas a consolidated entity sodiaal holds the remaining 49 percent interest in yoplait sas sodiaal has the ability to put a limited portion of its redeemable interest to us at fair value once per year up to a maximum of 9 years this put option requires us to classify sodiaal’s interest as a redeemable interest outside of equity on our consolidated balance sheets for as long as the put is exercisable by sodiaal when the put is no longer exercisable the redeemable interest will be reclassified to noncontrolling interests on our consolidated balance sheets we adjust the value of the redeemable interest through additional paidin capital on our consolidated balance sheets quarterly to the redeemable interest’s redemption value which approximates its fair value during the third quarter of fiscal 2013 we adjusted the redeemable interest’s redemption value based on a discounted cash flow model the significant assumptions used to estimate the redemption value include projected revenue growth and profitability from our long range plan capital spending depreciation and taxes foreign currency rates and a discount rate 

stockbased compensation 

the valuation of stock options is a significant accounting estimate that requires us to use judgments and assumptions that are likely to have a material impact on our financial statements annually we make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility employee exercise behavior dividend yield and the forfeiture rate 

we estimate our future stock price volatility using the historical volatility over the expected term of the option excluding time periods of volatility we believe a marketplace participant would exclude in estimating our stock price volatility we also have considered but did not use implied volatility in our estimate because trading activity in options on our stock especially those with tenors of greater than 6 months is insufficient to provide a reliable measure of expected volatility if all other assumptions are held constant a one percentage point increase in our fiscal 2013 volatility assumption would increase the grantdate fair value of our fiscal 2013 option awards by 9 percent 

our expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical data to estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model separate groups of employees have similar historical exercise behavior and therefore were aggregated into a single pool for valuation purposes the weightedaverage expected term for all employee groups is presented in the table below an increase in the expected term by 1 year leaving all other assumptions constant would increase the grant date fair value by 22 percent 

the riskfree interest rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based on the us treasury zerocoupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant 

the estimated fair values of stock options granted and the assumptions used for the blackscholes optionpricing model were as follows 

 

 to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our assumptions we are not required to true up grantdate fair valuebased expense to final intrinsic values however these differences can impact the classification of cash tax benefits realized upon exercise of stock options as explained in the following two paragraphs furthermore historical data has a significant bearing on our forwardlooking assumptions significant variances between actual and predicted experience could lead to prospective revisions in our assumptions which could then significantly impact the yearoveryear comparability of stockbased compensation expense 

  

any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings referred to as a windfall tax benefit is presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows as a financing cash flow the actual impact on future years’ financing cash flows will depend in part on the volume of employee stock option exercises during a particular year and the relationship between the exercisedate market value of the underlying stock and the original grantdate fair value previously determined for financial reporting purposes 

realized windfall tax benefits are credited to additional paidin capital within the consolidated balance sheets realized shortfall tax benefits amounts which are less than that previously recognized in earnings are first offset against the cumulative balance of windfall tax benefits if any and then charged directly to income tax expense potentially resulting in volatility in our consolidated effective income tax rate we calculated a cumulative amount of windfall tax benefits for the purpose of accounting for future shortfall tax benefits and currently have sufficient cumulative windfall tax benefits to absorb projected arising shortfalls such that we do not currently expect future earnings to be affected by this provision however as employee stock option exercise behavior is not within our control it is possible that materially different reported results could occur if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail 

income taxes 

we apply a morelikelythannot threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions accordingly we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement future changes in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect earnings in the quarter of such change 

we are subject to federal income taxes in the united states as well as various state local and foreign jurisdictions a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position we believe that our liabilities for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome we adjust these liabilities as well as the related interest in light of changing facts and circumstances settlement of any particular position would usually require the use of cash 

the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction our major taxing jurisdictions include the united states federal and state and canada various tax examinations by united states state taxing authorities could be conducted for any open tax year which vary by jurisdiction but are generally from 3 to 5 years 

the irs initiated its audit of our fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2012 tax years during fiscal 2013 currently several state examinations are in progress 

during fiscal 2013 the irs concluded its field examination of our 2009 and 2010 tax years the irs has proposed adjustments related to the timing for deducting accrued bonus expenses we believe our position is supported by substantial technical authority and have filed an appeal with the irs appeals division the audit closure and related proposed adjustments did not have a material impact on our current year results of operations or financial position if we are unsuccessful in defending our position with respect to accrued bonuses we will incur a onetime cash tax payment of approximately 80 million as of may 26 2013 we have effectively settled all issues with the irs for fiscal years 2008 and prior 

also during fiscal 2013 the california court of appeal issued an adverse decision concerning our state income tax apportionment calculations we had previously recorded a 12 million increase in our total liabilities for uncertain tax positions in fiscal 2011 following an unfavorable decision by the superior court of the state of california related to this matter we expect to pay a majority of the tax due related to this issue in fiscal 2014 

the canadian revenue agency cra reviewed our canadian income tax returns for fiscal years 2003 to 2005 and raised assessments for these years to which we have objected during fiscal 2013 the issue related to our 2003 fiscal year was resolved with no adjustment the issue for fiscal years 2004 and 2005 is currently under review by 

  

the us and canadian competent authority divisions the cra initiated its audit of our fiscal years 2008 through 2011 during fiscal year 2013 the cra audit for fiscal 2008 was closed with no significant adjustments the audit for fiscal years 2009 through 2011 is ongoing 

we do not anticipate that any united states or canadian tax adjustments will have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 

as of may 26 2013 our total liability for uncertain tax positions and accrued interest and penalties was 266 million we expect to pay approximately 12 million related to uncertain tax positions and accrued interest in the next 12 months we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes 

defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefit plans 

defined benefit pension plans 

we have defined benefit pension plans covering most employees in the united states canada france and the united kingdom benefits for salaried employees are based on length of service and final average compensation benefits for hourly employees include various monthly amounts for each year of credited service our funding policy is consistent with the requirements of applicable laws we made 200 million of voluntary contributions to our principal us plans in each of fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 we do not expect to be required to make any contributions in fiscal 2014 our principal domestic retirement plan covering salaried employees has a provision that any excess pension assets would be allocated to active participants if the plan is terminated within five years of a change in control in fiscal 2012 we announced changes to our us defined benefit pension plans all new salaried employees hired on or after june 1 2013 are eligible for a new retirement program that does not include a defined benefit pension plan current salaried employees remain in the existing defined benefit pension plan with adjustments to benefits 

other postretirement benefit plans 

we also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to the majority of our retirees in the united states canada and brazil the united states salaried health care benefit plan is contributory with retiree contributions based on years of service we make decisions to fund related trusts for certain employees and retirees on an annual basis we did not make voluntary contributions to these plans in fiscal 2013 the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 collectively the act was signed into law in march 2010 we continue to evaluate the effect of the act including its potential impact on the future cost of our benefit plans 

postemployment benefit plans 

under certain circumstances we also provide accruable benefits to former or inactive employees in the united states canada and mexico and members of our board of directors including severance and certain other benefits payable upon death we recognize an obligation for any of these benefits that vest or accumulate with service postemployment benefits that do not vest or accumulate with service such as severance based solely on annual pay rather than years of service are charged to expense when incurred our postemployment benefit plans are unfunded 

we recognize benefits provided during retirement or following employment over the plan participants’ active working life accordingly we make various assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement of our obligations assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our net periodic benefit expense or income and accumulated benefit obligations include the longterm rates of return on plan assets the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our benefit plans and the health care cost trend rates 

expected rate of return on plan assets 

our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation our historical longterm investment performance our estimate of future longterm returns by asset class using input from our actuaries investment services and investment managers and longterm inflation assumptions we review this assumption annually for each plan however our annual investment performance for one particular year does not by itself significantly influence our evaluation 

  

the investment objective for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans is to secure the benefit obligations to participants at a reasonable cost to us our goal is to optimize the longterm return on plan assets at a moderate level of risk the defined benefit pension plan and other postretirement benefit plan portfolios are broadly diversified across asset classes within asset classes the portfolios are further diversified across investment styles and investment organizations for the defined benefit pension plans the longterm investment policy allocation is 25 percent to equities in the united states 15 percent to international equities 10 percent to private equities 35 percent to fixed income and 15 percent to real assets real estate energy and timber for other postretirement benefit plans the longterm investment policy allocations are 30 percent to equities in the united states 20 percent to international equities 10 percent to private equities 30 percent to fixed income and 10 percent to real assets real estate energy and timber the actual allocations to these asset classes may vary tactically around the longterm policy allocations based on relative market valuations 

our historical investment returns compound annual growth rates for our united states defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan assets were 165 percent 45 percent 95 percent 79 percent and 95 percent for the 1 5 10 15 and 20 year periods ended may 26 2013 

on a weightedaverage basis the expected rate of return for all defined benefit plans was 853 percent for fiscal 2013 952 percent for fiscal 2012 and 953 percent for fiscal 2011 during fiscal 2012 we lowered our weightedaverage expected rate of return on plan assets for our principal defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in the united states to 86 percent due to generally lower expectations for longterm rates of return across our asset classes due to the recent global economic slowdown and our expectation of an extended time frame for recovery 

lowering the expected longterm rate of return on assets by 100 basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense by 56 million for fiscal 2014 a marketrelated valuation basis is used to reduce yeartoyear expense volatility the marketrelated valuation recognizes certain investment gains or losses over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the marketrelated value of assets and the actual return based on the marketrelated value of assets our outside actuaries perform these calculations as part of our determination of annual expense or income 

discount rates 

our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of the last day of our fiscal year for our defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefit plan obligations we also use the same discount rates to determine defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefit plan income and expense for the following fiscal year we work with our outside actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan participants and using the aa above median corporate bond yield to develop a forward interest rate curve including a margin to that index based on our credit risk this forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions 

our weightedaverage discount rates were as follows 

 

 lowering the discount rates by 100 basis points would increase our net defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefit plan expense for fiscal 2014 by approximately 89 million all obligationrelated experience gains and losses are amortized using a straightline method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants 

  

health care cost trend rates 

we review our health care cost trend rates annually our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims experience and information provided by our actuaries this information includes recent plan experience plan design overall industry experience and projections and assumptions used by other similar organizations our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with this review recent experiences and shortterm expectations our initial health care cost trend rate assumption is 80 percent for all retirees at the end of fiscal 2013 rates are graded down annually until the ultimate trend rate of 52 percent is reached in 2019 for all retirees the trend rates are applicable for calculations only if the retirees’ benefits increase as a result of health care inflation the ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually as necessary to approximate the current economic view on the rate of longterm inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium assumed trend rates for health care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans 

a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate would have the following effects 

 

 any arising health care claims costrelated experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculation of expected future claims once recognized experience gains and losses are amortized using a straightline method over 15 years resulting in at least the minimum amortization required being recorded 

financial statement impact 

in fiscal 2013 we recorded net defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefit plan expense of 159 million compared to 106 million of expense in fiscal 2012 and 95 million of expense in fiscal 2011 as of may 26 2013 we had cumulative unrecognized actuarial net losses of 16 billion on our defined benefit pension plans and 176 million on our postretirement and postemployment benefit plans mainly as the result of liability increases from lower interest rates partially offset by recent increases in the values of plan assets these unrecognized actuarial net losses will result in increases in our future pension expense and increases in postretirement expense since they currently exceed the corridors defined by gaap 

we use the 2013 irs static mortality table projected forward to our plans’ measurement dates to calculate the yearend defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefit obligations and annual expense 

actual future net defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefit plan income or expense will depend on investment performance changes in future discount rates changes in health care cost trend rates and other factors related to the populations participating in these plans 

the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 collectively the act was signed into law in march 2010 the act codifies health care reforms with staggered effective dates from 2010 to 2018 with many provisions in the act requiring the issuance of additional guidance from various government agencies estimates of the future impacts of several of the act’s provisions are incorporated into our postretirement benefit liability given the complexity of the act the extended time period over which the reforms will be implemented and the unknown impact of future regulatory guidance further financial impacts to our postretirement benefit liability and related future expense may occur 

  

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in december 2011 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new accounting disclosure requirements about the nature and exposure of offsetting arrangements related to financial and derivative instruments the requirements are effective for fiscal years beginning after january 1 2013 which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2014 the requirements will not impact our results of operations or financial position 

in february 2013 the fasb issued new disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci the requirements do not change the existing accounting and reporting for net income or other comprehensive income oci the requirements are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2012 and interim periods within those annual periods which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2014 the requirements will not impact our results of operations or financial position 

nongaap measures 

we have included in this report measures of financial performance that are not defined by gaap management and the board of directors believe that these measures provide useful information to investors and include these measures in other communications to investors 

for each of these nongaap financial measures we are providing below a reconciliation of the differences between the nongaap measure and the most directly comparable gaap measure an explanation of why our management or the board of directors believes the nongaap measure provides useful information to investors and any additional purposes for which our management or board of directors uses the nongaap measure these nongaap measures should be viewed in addition to and not in lieu of the comparable gaap measure 

total segment operating profit 

this measure is used in reporting to our executive management and as a component of the board of director’s measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes management and the board of directors believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is the profitability measure we use to evaluate segment performance a reconciliation of this measure to operating profit the relevant gaap measure is included in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

diluted eps excluding certain items affecting comparability 

this measure is used in reporting to our executive management and as a component of the board of director’s measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes management and the board of directors believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is the profitability measure we use to evaluate earnings performance on a comparable yearoveryear basis the adjustments are either items resulting from infrequently occurring events or items that in management’s judgment significantly affect the yearoveryear assessment of operating results 

  

the reconciliation of diluted eps excluding certain items affecting comparability to diluted eps the relevant gaap measure follows 

 

       return on average total capital 

this measure is used in reporting to our executive management and as a component of the board of director’s measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes management and the board of directors believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is important for assessing the utilization of capital and it eliminates certain items which affect yeartoyear comparability 

  

  net sales growth rates for our international segment excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange 

management and the board of directors believe that this measure of our international segment and region net sales provides useful information to investors because it provides transparency to the underlying performance in markets outside the united states by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on yeartoyear comparability given volatility in foreign exchange markets 

to present this information current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than united states dollars are translated into united states dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year rather than the actual average exchange rates in effect during the current fiscal year therefore the foreign currency impact is equal to current year results in local currencies multiplied by the change in the average foreign currency exchange rate between the current fiscal period and the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates and commodity and equity prices changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows in the normal course of business we actively manage our exposure to these market risks by entering into various hedging transactions authorized under established policies that place clear controls on these activities the counterparties in these transactions are generally highly rated institutions we establish credit limits for each counterparty our hedging transactions include but are not limited to a variety of derivative financial instruments 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixedrate debt and existing and future issuances of floatingrate debt primary exposures include us treasury rates libor euribor and commercial paper rates in the united states and europe we use interest rate swaps forwardstarting interest rate swaps and treasury locks to hedge our exposure to interest rate changes to reduce the volatility of our financing costs and to achieve a desired proportion of fixed versus floatingrate debt based on current and projected market conditions generally under these swaps we agree with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixedrate and floatingrate interest amounts based on an agreed upon notional principal amount 

as of may 26 2013 we had interest rate swaps with 550 million of aggregate notional principal amount outstanding all of which converts fixedrate notes to floatingrate notes in advance of a planned debt refinancing we had 250 million net notional amount of treasury locks as of may 26 2013 

foreign exchange risk 

foreign currency fluctuations affect our net investments in foreign subsidiaries and foreign currency cash flows related to third party purchases intercompany loans product shipments and foreigndenominated commercial paper we are also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the us dollar our principal exposures are to the australian dollar brazilian real british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese renminbi euro japanese yen mexican peso and swiss franc we mainly use foreign currency forward contracts to selectively hedge our foreign currency cash flow exposures we also generally swap our foreigndenominated commercial paper borrowings and nonfunctional currency intercompany loans back to us dollars or the functional currency of the entity with foreign exchange exposure the gains or losses on these derivatives offset the foreign currency revaluation gains or losses recorded in earnings on the associated borrowings we generally do not hedge more than 18 months forward 

we also have many net investments in foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in euros we previously hedged a portion of these net investments by issuing eurodenominated commercial paper and foreign exchange forward contracts as of may 26 2013 we had deferred net foreign currency transaction losses of 96 million in aoci associated with hedging activity 

  

commodity price risk 

many commodities we use in the production and distribution of our products are exposed to market price risks we utilize derivatives to manage price risk for our principal ingredients and energy costs including grains oats wheat and corn oils principally soybean nonfat dry milk natural gas and diesel fuel our primary objective when entering into these derivative contracts is to achieve certainty with regard to the future price of commodities purchased for use in our supply chain we manage our exposures through a combination of purchase orders longterm contracts with suppliers exchangetraded futures and options and overthecounter options and swaps we offset our exposures based on current and projected market conditions and generally seek to acquire the inputs at as close to our planned cost as possible 

as of may 26 2013 the net notional value of commodity derivatives was 526 million of which 297 million related to agricultural inputs and 229 million related to energy inputs these contracts relate to inputs that generally will be utilized within the next 12 months 

equity instruments 

equity price movements affect our compensation expense as certain investments made by our employees in our deferred compensation plan are revalued we use equity swaps to manage this risk as of may 26 2013 the net notional amount of our equity swaps was 57 million 

value at risk 

the estimates in the table below are intended to measure the maximum potential fair value we could lose in one day from adverse changes in market interest rates foreign exchange rates commodity prices and equity prices under normal market conditions a monte carlo valueatrisk var methodology was used to quantify the market risk for our exposures the models assumed normal market conditions and used a 95 percent confidence level 

the var calculation used historical interest rates foreign exchange rates and commodity and equity prices from the past year to estimate the potential volatility and correlation of these rates in the future the market data were drawn from the riskmetrics™ data set the calculations are not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that we expect to incur further since the hedging instrument the derivative inversely correlates with the underlying exposure we would expect that any loss or gain in the fair value of our derivatives would be generally offset by an increase or decrease in the fair value of the underlying exposure the positions included in the calculations were debt investments interest rate swaps foreign exchange forwards commodity swaps futures and options and equity instruments the calculations do not include the underlying foreign exchange and commodities or equityrelated positions that are offset by these marketrisksensitive instruments 

the table below presents the estimated maximum potential var arising from a oneday loss in fair value for our interest rate foreign currency commodity and equity marketrisksensitive instruments outstanding as of may 26 2013 and may 27 2012 and the average fair value impact during the year ended may 26 2013

competition 

the consumer foods industry is highly competitive with numerous manufacturers of varying sizes in the united states and throughout the world the food categories in which we participate are also very competitive our principal competitors in these categories all have substantial financial marketing and other resources competition in our product categories is based on product innovation product quality price brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing promotional activity and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences our principal strategies for competing in each of our segments include effective customer relationships superior product quality innovative advertising product promotion product innovation an efficient supply chain and price in most product categories we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products but also with generic and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices internationally we compete with both multinational and local manufacturers and each country includes a unique group of competitors 

seasonality 

in general demand for our products is evenly balanced throughout the year however within our us retail segment demand for refrigerated dough frozen baked goods and baking products is stronger in the fourth calendar quarter demand for progresso soup and green giant canned and frozen vegetables is higher during the fall and winter months internationally demand for häagendazs ice cream is higher during the summer months and demand for baking mix and dough products increases during winter months due to the offsetting impact of these demand trends as well as the different seasons in the northern and southern hemispheres our international segment net sales are generally evenly balanced throughout the year 

backlog 

orders are generally filled within a few days of receipt and are subject to cancellation at any time prior to shipment the backlog of any unfilled orders as of may 27 2012 was not material 

  

working capital 

a description of our working capital is included in the liquidity section of mda in item 7 of this report our product return practices are described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

employees 

as of may 27 2012 we had approximately 35000 full and parttime employees 

food quality and safety regulation 

the manufacture and sale of consumer food products is highly regulated in the united states our activities are subject to regulation by various federal government agencies including the food and drug administration department of agriculture federal trade commission department of commerce and environmental protection agency as well as various state and local agencies our business is also regulated by similar agencies outside of the united states 

environmental matters 

as of may 27 2012 we were involved with three active cleanup sites associated with the alleged or threatened release of hazardous substances or wastes located in sauget illinois minneapolis minnesota and moonachie new jersey these matters involve several different actions including administrative proceedings commenced by regulatory agencies and demand letters by regulatory agencies and private parties 

we recognize that our potential exposure with respect to any of these sites may be joint and several but have concluded that our probable aggregate exposure is not material to our consolidated financial position or cash flows from operations this conclusion is based upon among other things our payments and accruals with respect to each site the number ranking and financial strength of other potentially responsible parties the status of the proceedings including various settlement agreements consent decrees or court orders allocations of volumetric waste contributions and allocations of relative responsibility among potentially responsible parties developed by regulatory agencies and by private parties remediation cost estimates prepared by governmental authorities or private technical consultants and our historical experience in negotiating and settling disputes with respect to similar sites 

our operations are subject to the clean air act clean water act resource conservation and recovery act comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act and all similar state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations applicable to the jurisdictions in which we operate 

based on current facts and circumstances we believe that neither the results of our environmental proceedings nor our compliance in general with environmental laws or regulations will have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position

 item 1a risk factors tableend our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties any of the risks described below could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the food categories in which we participate are very competitive and if we are not able to compete effectively our results of operations could be adversely affected 

the food categories in which we participate are very competitive our principal competitors in these categories all have substantial financial marketing and other resources in most product categories we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products but also with generic and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices competition in our product categories is based on product innovation product quality price brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing promotional activity and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences if our large competitors were to seek an advantage through pricing or promotional changes we could choose to do the same which could adversely affect our margins and profitability if we did not do the same our revenues and market share could be adversely affected our market share and revenue growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing innovative products in response to changing consumer demands or by new product introductions of our competitors if we are unable to build and sustain brand equity by offering recognizably superior product quality we may be unable to maintain premium pricing over generic and private label products 

we may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face of a consolidating retail environment 

the five largest customers in our us retail segment accounted for 54 percent of its net sales for fiscal 2012 the five largest customers in our international segment accounted for 26 percent of its net sales for fiscal 2012 and the five largest customers in our bakeries and foodservice segment accounted for 46 percent of its net sales for fiscal 2012 the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could adversely affect our sales and profits in addition large retail customers may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency lower pricing increased reliance on their own brand name products increased emphasis on generic and other economy brands and increased promotional programs if we are unable to use our scale marketing expertise product innovation knowledge of consumers’ needs and category leadership positions to respond to these demands our profitability or volume growth could be negatively impacted 

price changes for the commodities we depend on for raw materials packaging and energy may adversely affect our profitability 

the principal raw materials that we use are commodities that experience price volatility caused by external conditions such as weather product scarcity limited sources of supply commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations commodity price 

  

changes may result in unexpected increases in raw material packaging and energy costs if we are unable to increase productivity to offset these increased costs or increase our prices we may experience reduced margins and profitability we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and the risk management procedures that we do use may not always work as we intend 

volatility in the market value of derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices will cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings 

we utilize derivatives to manage price risk for some of our principal ingredient and energy costs including grains oats wheat and corn oils principally soybean nonfat dry milk natural gas and diesel fuel changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded in earnings currently resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings these gains and losses are reported in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of earnings and in unallocated corporate items in our segment operating results until we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating profit we also record our grain inventories at fair value we may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments 

if we are not efficient in our production our profitability could suffer as a result of the highly competitive environment in which we operate 

our future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to be efficient in the production and manufacture of our products in highly competitive markets gaining additional efficiencies may become more difficult over time our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or by eliminating redundant costs resulting from acquisitions could adversely affect our profitability and weaken our competitive position many productivity initiatives involve complex reorganization of manufacturing facilities and production lines such manufacturing realignment may result in the interruption of production which may negatively impact product volume and margins 

disruption of our supply chain could adversely affect our business 

our ability to make move and sell products is critical to our success damage or disruption to raw material supplies or our manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather including any potential effects of climate change natural disaster fire terrorism pandemic strikes import restrictions or other factors could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or to effectively manage such events if they occur particularly when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location could adversely affect our business and results of operations as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain 

concerns with the safety and quality of food products could cause consumers to avoid certain food products or ingredients 

we could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients adverse publicity about these types of concerns whether or not valid may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions 

if our food products become adulterated misbranded or mislabeled we might need to recall those items and may experience product liability claims if consumers are injured 

we may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated misbranded or mislabeled a widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time we could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us a significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity damage to our reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in our food products which could have an adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands 

  

we may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and trends which may result in decreased demand for our products 

our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes and eating habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences consumer preferences change from time to time and can be affected by a number of different trends our failure to anticipate identify or react to these changes and trends or to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis could result in reduced demand for our products which would in turn cause our revenues and profitability to suffer similarly demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns regarding the health effects of ingredients such as sodium trans fats sugar processed wheat or other product ingredients or attributes 

we may be unable to grow our market share or add products that are in faster growing and more profitable categories 

the food industry’s growth potential is constrained by population growth our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business faster than populations are growing in the markets that we serve one way to achieve that growth is to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new products in faster growing and more profitable categories our future results will also depend on our ability to increase market share in our existing product categories if we do not succeed in developing innovative products for new and existing categories our growth may slow which could adversely affect our profitability 

economic downturns could limit consumer demand for our products 

the willingness of consumers to purchase our products depends in part on local economic conditions in periods of economic uncertainty consumers may purchase more generic private label and other economy brands and may forego certain purchases altogether in those circumstances we could experience a reduction in sales of higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings in addition as a result of economic conditions or competitive actions we may be unable to raise our prices sufficiently to protect margins consumers may also reduce the amount of food that they consume away from home at customers that purchase products from our bakeries and foodservice segment any of these events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

our international operations are subject to political and economic risks 

in fiscal 2012 25 percent of our consolidated net sales were generated outside of the united states we are accordingly subject to a number of risks relating to doing business internationally any of which could significantly harm our business these risks include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 our financial performance on a us dollar denominated basis is subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates these fluctuations could cause material variations in our results of operations our principal exposures are to the australian dollar brazilian real british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese renminbi euro japanese yen and mexican peso from time to time we enter into agreements that are intended to reduce the effects of our exposure to currency fluctuations but these agreements may not be effective in significantly reducing our exposure 

  

new regulations or regulatorybased claims could adversely affect our business 

food production and marketing are highly regulated by a variety of federal state local and foreign agencies changes in laws or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements on us including regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could increase our cost of doing business or restrict our actions causing our results of operations to be adversely affected in addition we advertise our products and could be the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal state and foreign laws and regulations we may also be subject to new laws or regulations restricting our right to advertise products including the interagency working group on food marketed to children preliminary proposed nutrition principles to guide industry selfregulatory efforts and other proposals to limit advertising to children 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could limit financing and other options and in some cases adversely affect our ability to pay dividends 

as of may 27 2012 we had total debt redeemable interests and noncontrolling interests of 87 billion the agreements under which we have issued indebtedness do not prevent us from incurring additional unsecured indebtedness in the future our level of indebtedness may limit our 

• ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures or general corporate purposes particularly if the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward and 

• flexibility to adjust to changing business and market conditions and may make us more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions 

there are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments and noncontrolling interests if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the related indebtedness and other unrelated indebtedness could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity and our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing may also be adversely affected 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt and other obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control 

global capital and credit market issues could negatively affect our liquidity increase our costs of borrowing and disrupt the operations of our suppliers and customers 

we depend on stable liquid and wellfunctioning capital and credit markets to fund our operations although we believe that our operating cash flows financial assets access to capital and credit markets and revolvingcredit agreements will permit us to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing our business could also be negatively impacted if our suppliers or customers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy 

volatility in the securities markets interest rates and other factors or changes in our employee base could substantially increase our defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefit costs 

we sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the united states canada and various foreign locations including defined benefit pension retiree health and welfare severance directors’ life and other postemployment plans our major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments changes in interest rates mortality rates health care costs early retirement rates investment returns and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plans a significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations 

  

our business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately 

the efficient operation of our business depends on our information technology systems we rely on our information technology systems to effectively manage our business data communications supply chain order entry and fulfillment and other business processes the failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in transaction errors processing inefficiencies and the loss of sales and customers causing our business and results of operations to suffer in addition our information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control including fire natural disasters systems failures security breaches and viruses any such damage or interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business 

if other potentially responsible parties prps are unable to contribute to remediation costs at certain contaminated sites our costs for remediation could be material 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign environmental and health and safety laws and regulations under certain of these laws namely the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and its state counterparts liability for investigation and remediation of hazardous substance contamination at currently or formerly owned or operated facilities or at thirdparty waste disposal sites is joint and several we currently are involved in active remediation efforts at certain sites where we have been named a prp if other prps at these sites are unable to contribute to remediation costs we could be held responsible for their portion of the remediation costs and those costs could be material we cannot assure that our costs in relation to these environmental matters or compliance with environmental laws in general will not exceed our established liabilities or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

a change in the assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses or a different weightedaverage cost of capital used to value our reporting units or our indefinitelived intangible assets could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth 

goodwill for each of our reporting units is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred we compare the carrying value of the net assets of a reporting unit including goodwill to the fair value of the unit if the fair value of the net assets of the reporting unit is less than the net assets including goodwill impairment has occurred our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our annual longrange planning process we also make estimates of discount rates perpetuity growth assumptions market comparables and other factors while we currently believe that our goodwill is not impaired different assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses could result in significant impairment losses 

we evaluate the useful lives of our intangible assets primarily intangible assets associated with the pillsbury  totino’s  progresso  green giant  yoplait  old el paso  and häagendazs brands to determine if they are finite or indefinitelived reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry known technological advances legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 

our indefinitelived intangible assets are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable our estimate of the fair value of the brands is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs including projected revenues from our annual longrange plan assumed royalty rates which could be payable if we did not own the brands and a discount rate 

as of may 27 2012 we had 124 billion of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets while we currently believe that the fair value of each intangible exceeds its carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses or a different weightedaverage cost of capital could result in significant impairment losses and amortization expense 

  

our failure to successfully integrate acquisitions into our existing operations could adversely affect our financial results 

from time to time we evaluate potential acquisitions or joint ventures that would further our strategic objectives our success depends in part upon our ability to integrate acquired and existing operations if we are unable to successfully integrate acquisitions our financial results could suffer additional potential risks associated with acquisitions include additional debt leverage the loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business the assumption of unknown liabilities the inherent risk associated with entering a line of business in which we have no or limited prior experience failure to achieve anticipated synergies and the impairment of goodwill or other acquisitionrelated intangible assets

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend executive overview 

we are a global consumer foods company we develop distinctive valueadded food products and market them under unique brand names we work continuously to improve our established products and to create new products that meet consumers’ evolving needs and preferences in addition we build the equity of our brands over time with strong consumerdirected marketing and innovative merchandising we believe our brandbuilding strategy is the key to winning and sustaining leading share positions in markets around the globe 

our fundamental business goal is to generate superior returns for our stockholders over the long term we believe that increases in net sales segment operating profit earnings per share eps and return on average total capital are the key measures of financial performance for our business see the “nongaap measures” section below for a description of our discussion of total segment operating profit diluted eps excluding certain items affecting comparability and return on average total capital which are not defined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap 

our objectives are to consistently deliver 

 

  

  

  

 we believe that this financial performance coupled with an attractive dividend yield should result in longterm value creation for stockholders we return a substantial amount of cash to stockholders through share repurchases and dividends 

fiscal 2012 was a challenging year for us as well as the rest of the food industry as we experienced doubledigit input cost inflation and consumers were affected by the slow economic recovery around the world for the fiscal year ended may 27 2012 our net sales grew 12 percent and total segment operating profit grew 2 percent diluted eps declined 13 percent and our return on average total capital declined by 110 basis points diluted eps excluding certain items affecting comparability increased 3 percent from fiscal 2011 see the “nongaap measures” section below for our use of this measure and our discussion of the items affecting comparability net cash provided by operations totaled 24 billion in fiscal 2012 enabling us to partially fund the acquisition of yoplait sas and yoplait marques sas and to increase our annual dividend payments per share by 9 percent from fiscal 2011 we also made significant capital investments totaling 676 million in fiscal 2012 

we achieved the following related to our three key operating objectives for fiscal 2012 

 

  

  

   

details of our financial results are provided in the “fiscal 2012 consolidated results of operations” section below 

looking ahead we expect slow improvement in the operating environment for food companies around the globe although we believe the consumer environment will remain challenging in fiscal 2013 we expect to deliver another year of quality growth excluding the effects of our pending acquisition of yoki alimentos sa yoki we expect to achieve these results 

 

  

  

 our businesses generate strong levels of cash flows and we use some of this cash to reinvest in our business our fiscal 2013 plans call for approximately 650 million of expenditures for capital projects excluding expenditures that may be required for yoki on june 26 2012 our board of directors approved a dividend increase to an annual rate of 132 per share an 8 percent increase from the rate paid in fiscal 2012 

we expect that share repurchases will at least offset normal levels of stock option exercises in fiscal 2013

the components of net sales growth are shown in the following table 

components of net sales growth 

 

  net sales grew 12 percent in fiscal 2012 due to 9 percentage points of contribution from volume growth including 12 percentage points of volume growth contributed by the acquisition of yoplait sas net price realization and mix contributed 3 percentage points of net sales growth foreign currency exchange was flat compared to fiscal 2011 

  

cost of sales increased 1686 million in fiscal 2012 to 10613 million this increase was driven by an 877 million increase attributable to higher volume and a 610 million increase attributable to higher inputs costs and product mix we recorded a 104 million net increase in cost of sales related to marktomarket valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories as described in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report compared to a net decrease of 95 million in fiscal 2011 

gross margin grew 2 percent in fiscal 2012 versus fiscal 2011 gross margin as a percent of net sales decreased by 370 basis points from fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2012 this decrease was primarily driven by higher input costs and losses from marktomarket valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories in fiscal 2012 versus gains in fiscal 2011 

selling general and administrative sga expenses were up 189 million in fiscal 2012 versus fiscal 2011 sga expenses as a percent of net sales in fiscal 2012 decreased by 1 percentage point compared to fiscal 2011 the increase in sga expenses was primarily driven by the acquisition of yoplait sas and an 8 percent increase in advertising and media expense 

there were no divestitures in fiscal 2012 in fiscal 2011 we recorded a net divestiture gain of 17 million consisting of a gain of 14 million related to the sale of a foodservice frozen baked goods product line in our international segment and a gain of 3 million related to the sale of a pie shell product line in our bakeries and foodservice segment 

restructuring impairment and other exit costs totaled 102 million in fiscal 2012 as follows 

 

 in fiscal 2012 we approved a major productivity and cost savings plan designed to improve organizational effectiveness and focus on key growth strategies the plan includes organizational changes that strengthen business alignment and actions to accelerate administrative efficiencies across all of our operating segments and support functions in connection with this initiative we expect to eliminate approximately 850 positions globally and recorded a 101 million restructuring charge consisting of 88 million of employee severance expense and a noncash charge of 13 million related to the writeoff of certain longlived assets in our us retail segment all of our operating segments and support functions were affected by these actions including 70 million related to our us retail segment 12 million related to our bakeries and foodservice segment 10 million related to our international segment and 9 million related to our administrative functions we expect to record approximately 19 million of restructuring charges as a result of these actions in fiscal 2013 these restructuring actions are expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 2014 in fiscal 2012 we paid 4 million in cash related to restructuring actions taken in fiscal 2012 and previous years 

interest net for fiscal 2012 totaled 352 million 6 million higher than fiscal 2011 average interest bearing instruments increased 792 million in fiscal 2012 primarily due to the acquisitions of yoplait sas and yoplait marques sas generating a 46 million increase in net interest the average interest rate decreased 55 basis points including the effect of the mix of debt generating a 40 million decrease in net interest 

our consolidated effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 was 321 percent compared to 297 percent in fiscal 2011 the 24 percentage point increase was primarily due to a 100 million reduction to tax expense recorded in fiscal 2011 related to a settlement with the internal revenue service irs concerning corporate income tax adjustments for fiscal years 2002 to 2008 

  

aftertax earnings from joint ventures for fiscal 2012 decreased to 88 million compared to 96 million in fiscal 2011 primarily due to higher effective tax rates as a result of discrete tax items in fiscal 2012 

the change in net sales for each joint venture is set forth in the following table

the components of net sales growth are shown in the following table 

components of net sales growth 

 

  net sales grew 2 percent in fiscal 2011 due to 1 percentage point of contribution from volume growth and 1 percentage point of growth from net price realization and mix foreign exchange was flat compared to fiscal 2010 

cost of sales increased 91 million in fiscal 2011 to 8927 million this was driven by a 157 million increase attributable to higher net input costs and product mix and an 84 million increase attributable to higher volume partially offset by a 95 million net decrease in cost of sales related to marktomarket valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories compared to a net increase of 7 million in fiscal 2010 in fiscal 2010 we recorded a charge of 48 million resulting from a change in the capitalization threshold for certain equipment parts 

  

gross margin grew 3 percent in fiscal 2011 versus fiscal 2010 gross margin as a percent of net sales increased by 40 basis points from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 these improvements were primarily driven by gains from the marktomarket valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories in fiscal 2011 versus losses in fiscal 2010 

selling general and administrative sga expenses were up 29 million in fiscal 2011 versus fiscal 2010 while sga expenses as a percent of net sales remained essentially flat from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 the increase in sga expenses was primarily driven by a 69 million increase in corporate pension expense partially offset by a 7 percent decrease in advertising and media expense in fiscal 2010 the venezuelan government devalued the bolivar fuerte exchange rate against the us dollar the 14 million foreign exchange loss resulting from the devaluation was substantially offset by a 13 million recovery against a corporate investment 

during fiscal 2011 we recorded a net divestiture gain of 17 million we recorded a gain of 14 million related to the sale of a foodservice frozen baked goods product line in our international segment and a gain of 3 million related to the sale of a pie shell product line in our bakeries and foodservice segment there were no divestitures in fiscal 2010 

restructuring impairment and other exit costs totaled 4 million in fiscal 2011 as follows 

 

 in fiscal 2011 we decided to exit an underperforming product line in our us retail segment as a result of this decision we concluded that the future cash flows generated by this product line were insufficient to recover the net book value of the associated longlived assets accordingly we recorded a noncash charge of 2 million related to the impairment of the associated longlived assets no employees were affected by these actions in addition we recorded 3 million of charges associated with restructuring actions previously announced in fiscal 2011 we paid 6 million in cash related to restructuring actions taken in fiscal 2011 and previous years 

interest net for fiscal 2011 totaled 346 million 55 million lower than fiscal 2010 the average interest rate on our total outstanding debt was 56 percent in fiscal 2011 compared to 63 percent in fiscal 2010 generating a 45 million decrease in net interest average interest bearing instruments increased 474 million in fiscal 2011 primarily due to more share repurchases than in fiscal 2010 leading to a 30 million increase in net interest in fiscal 2010 we also recorded a loss of 40 million related to the repurchase of certain notes which represented the premium paid the writeoff of remaining discount and unamortized fees and the settlement of related swaps 

our consolidated effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 was 297 percent compared to 350 percent in fiscal 2010 the 53 percentage point decrease was primarily due to a 100 million reduction to tax expense recorded in fiscal 2011 related to a settlement with the irs concerning corporate income tax adjustments for fiscal years 2002 to 2008 the adjustments primarily relate to the amount of capital loss depreciation and amortization we reported as a result of the sale of noncontrolling interests in our general mills cereals llc gmc subsidiary fiscal 2010 income tax expense included a 35 million increase related to the enactment of federal health care reform the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 this legislation changed the tax treatment of subsidies to companies that provide prescription drug benefits that are at least the equivalent of benefits under medicare part d see the “impact of inflation” section below for additional discussion of this legislation 

aftertax earnings from joint ventures for fiscal 2011 decreased to 96 million compared to 102 million in fiscal 2010 the decrease is primarily due to higher advertising and media spending and increased service cost allocations all in cpw 

  

the change in net sales for each joint venture is set forth in the following table 

joint venture change in net sales 

 

 in fiscal 2011 cpw net sales grew by 3 percent due to a 2 percentage point increase in volume and a 1 percentage point increase from favorable foreign exchange net price realization and mix was flat compared to fiscal 2010 in fiscal 2011 net sales for hdj increased 4 percent from fiscal 2010 primarily due to 9 percentage points of favorable foreign exchange partially offset by a 5 percentage point decline in net price realization and mix volume was flat compared to fiscal 2010

segment operating profit for fiscal 2011 grew 52 percent to 291 million from 192 million in fiscal 2010 primarily driven by volume growth and favorable foreign currency exchange in fiscal 2010 we incurred a 14 million foreign exchange loss on the revaluation of nonbolivar fuerte monetary balances in venezuela 

in january 2010 the venezuelan government devalued the bolivar fuerte by resetting the official exchange rate the effect of the devaluation was a 14 million foreign exchange loss in fiscal 2010 primarily on the revaluation of non bolivar fuerte monetary balances in venezuela we continue to use the official exchange rate to remeasure the financial statements of our venezuelan operations as we intend to remit dividends solely through the governmentoperated foreign exchange administration board cadivi the devaluation of the bolivar fuerte also reduced the us dollar equivalent of our venezuelan results of operations and financial condition but this did not have a material impact on our results during fiscal 2010 venezuela became a highly inflationary economy which did not have a material impact on our results in fiscal 2012 2011 or 2010 

bakeries and foodservice segment

for fiscal 2012 net sales for our bakeries and foodservice segment increased 8 percent to 1983 million the increase in fiscal 2012 was driven by an increase in net price realization and mix of 7 percentage points and 1 percentage point contributed by volume growth 

for fiscal 2011 net sales for our bakeries and foodservice segment increased 6 percent to 1841 million the increase in fiscal 2011 was driven by an increase in net price realization and mix of 6 percentage points primarily from prices indexed to commodity markets contributions from volume were flat including a 2 percentage point decline from a divested product line

 bakeries and foodservice net sales percentage change by customer channel 

 

 in fiscal 2012 segment operating profit was 287 million down from 306 million in fiscal 2011 the decrease was primarily driven by lower grain merchandising earnings 

segment operating profit was 306 million in fiscal 2011 up from 263 million in fiscal 2010 the increase was primarily driven by net price realization and mix and increased grain merchandising earnings partially offset by higher input costs 

unallocated corporate items 

unallocated corporate items include corporate overhead expenses variances to planned domestic employee benefits and incentives contributions to the general mills foundation and other items that are not part of our measurement of segment operating performance this includes gains and losses from marktomarket valuation of certain commodity positions until passed back to our operating segments in accordance with our policy as discussed in note 2 of the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

for fiscal 2012 unallocated corporate expense totaled 348 million compared to 184 million last year in fiscal 2012 we recorded a 104 million net increase in expense related to marktomarket valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories compared to a 95 million net decrease in expense last year in fiscal 2012 we also recorded 11 million of integration costs related to the acquisition of yoplait sas and yoplait marques sas these increases in expense were partially offset by a decrease in compensation and benefit expense compared to fiscal 2011 

unallocated corporate expense totaled 184 million in fiscal 2011 compared to 203 million in fiscal 2010 in fiscal 2011 we recorded a 95 million net decrease in expense related to marktomarket valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories compared to a 7 million net increase in expense in fiscal 2010 this was partially offset by a 69 million increase in corporate pension expense in fiscal 2011 in fiscal 2010 we recorded a 13 million recovery against a corporate investment 

impact of inflation 

we have experienced significant input cost volatility since fiscal 2006 our gross margin performance in fiscal 2012 reflects the impact of 10 percent input cost inflation primarily on commodities inputs we expect the rate of inflation of commodities and energy costs to moderate in fiscal 2013 we attempt to minimize the effects of inflation through planning and operating practices our risk management practices are discussed in item 7a of this report 

  

the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 collectively the act was signed into law in march 2010 the act codifies health care reforms with staggered effective dates from 2010 to 2018 many provisions in the act require the issuance of additional guidance from various government agencies because the act does not take effect fully until future years the act did not have a material impact on our fiscal 2012 2011 or 2010 results of operations given the complexity of the act the extended time period over which the reforms will be implemented and the unknown impact of future regulatory guidance the full impact of the act on future periods will not be known until those regulations are adopted 

liquidity 

the primary source of our liquidity is cash flow from operations over the most recent threeyear period our operations have generated 61 billion in cash a substantial portion of this operating cash flow has been returned to stockholders through share repurchases and dividends we also use this source of liquidity to fund our capital expenditures we typically use a combination of cash notes payable and longterm debt to finance acquisitions and major capital expansions 

as of may 27 2012 we had 446 million of cash and cash equivalents held in foreign jurisdictions which will be used to fund foreign operations and acquisitions there is currently no intent or need to repatriate these funds in order to meet domestic funding obligations or scheduled cash distributions if we choose to repatriate cash held in foreign jurisdictions we will only do so in a taxneutral manner 

cash flows from operations 

 

 in fiscal 2012 our operations generated 24 billion of cash compared to 15 billion in fiscal 2011 the 875 million increase primarily reflects changes in current assets and liabilities including a 384 million increase driven by inventory reduction efforts in fiscal 2012 prepaid expenses and other current assets accounted for a 245 million increase primarily reflecting changes in foreign currency hedges and the fair value of open grain contracts other current liabilities accounted for a 386 million increase primarily reflecting changes in accrued income taxes as a result of audit settlements and court decisions in fiscal 2011 and changes in consumer marketing and related accruals the favorable change in working capital was offset by a 214 million decrease in net earnings additionally fiscal 2012 includes noncash restructuring charges of 101 million reflecting employee severance expense and the writeoff of certain longlived assets in both fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 we made a 200 million voluntary contribution to our principal domestic pension plans 

  

we strive to grow core working capital at or below our growth in net sales for fiscal 2012 core working capital decreased 7 percent compared to net sales growth of 12 percent primarily reflecting our inventory reduction efforts in fiscal 2011 core working capital increased 16 percent compared to net sales growth of 2 percent and in fiscal 2010 core working capital increased 3 percent compared to net sales growth of 1 percent 

in fiscal 2011 our operations generated 15 billion of cash compared to 22 billion in fiscal 2010 the decrease primarily reflects an 864 million increase in use of cash for net current assets and liabilities and a 200 million voluntary contribution to our principal domestic pension plans partially offset by the 268 million increase in net earnings and a 183 million change in deferred income taxes primarily related to our pension plan contribution and a change in tax legislation related to depreciation deductions 

cash flows from investing activities 

 

 in fiscal 2012 cash used by investing activities increased by 12 billion from fiscal 2011 the increased use of cash primarily reflects the acquisitions of yoplait sas and yoplait marques sas in fiscal 2012 for an aggregate purchase price of 12 billion comprised of 900 million of cash net of 30 million of cash acquired and 261 million of noncash consideration for debt assumed in addition we purchased a zero coupon exchangeable note due in 2016 from sodiaal with a notional amount of 132 million we invested 676 million in land buildings and equipment in fiscal 2012 

in fiscal 2011 cash used by investing activities decreased by 6 million from fiscal 2010 the decreased use of cash reflects 25 million of proceeds from the divestiture of a foodservice frozen baked goods product line in our international segment and 9 million of proceeds from the sale of a pie shell product line in our bakeries and foodservice segment in fiscal 2011 in addition in fiscal 2011 we paid 123 million for acquisitions during the year we also invested 131 million in affiliates in fiscal 2010 mainly our cpw joint venture to repay local borrowings 

we expect capital expenditures to be approximately 650 million in fiscal 2013 excluding any expenditures required to support yoki these expenditures will support initiatives that are expected to increase manufacturing capacity for grain snacks and greek yogurt fuel international growth and expansion continue hmm initiatives throughout the supply chain and support yogurt capacity initiatives of yoplait sas 

  

cash flows from financing activities 

 

 net cash used by financing activities decreased by 275 million in fiscal 2012 

in february 2012 we repaid 10 billion of 60 percent notes in november 2011 we issued 10 billion aggregate principal amount of 315 percent notes due december 15 2021 the net proceeds were used to repay a portion of our notes due february 2012 to reduce our commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes interest on these notes is payable semiannually in arrears these notes may be redeemed at our option at any time prior to september 15 2021 for a specified make whole amount and any time on or after that date at par these notes are senior unsecured unsubordinated obligations that include a change of control repurchase provision 

as part of our acquisition of yoplait sas we consolidated 458 million of primarily eurodenominated euriborbased floatingrate bank debt in december 2011 we refinanced this debt with 390 million of eurodenominated euriborbased floatingrate bank debt due at various dates through december 15 2014 

in may 2011 we issued 300 million aggregate principal amount of 155 percent fixedrate notes and 400 million aggregate principal amount of floatingrate notes both due may 16 2014 the proceeds of these notes were used to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper the floatingrate notes bear interest equal to threemonth libor plus 35 basis points subject to quarterly reset interest on the floatingrate notes is payable quarterly in arrears interest on the fixedrate notes is payable semiannually in arrears the fixedrate notes may be redeemed at our option at any time for a specified make whole amount these notes are senior unsecured unsubordinated obligations that include a change of control repurchase provision 

in june 2010 we issued 500 million aggregate principal amount of 54 percent notes due 2040 the proceeds of these notes were used to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper interest on these notes is payable semiannually in arrears these notes may be redeemed at our option at any time for a specified make whole amount these notes are senior unsecured unsubordinated obligations that include a change of control repurchase provision 

in may 2010 we paid 437 million to repurchase in a cash tender offer 400 million of our previously issued debt we repurchased 221 million of our 60 percent notes due 2012 and 179 million of our 565 percent notes due 2012 we issued commercial paper to fund the repurchase 

during fiscal 2012 we had 234 million in proceeds from common stock issued on exercised options compared to 410 million in fiscal 2011 a decrease of 177 million during fiscal 2010 we had 389 million proceeds from common stock issued on exercised options 

during fiscal 2012 we repurchased 8 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 313 million during fiscal 2011 we repurchased 32 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 1164 million during fiscal 2010 we repurchased 21 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 692 million on june 28 2010 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 100 million shares of our common stock purchases under the authorization can be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions including the use of call options and other derivative instruments rule 10b51 trading plans and accelerated repurchase programs the authorization has no specified termination date

selected cash flows from joint ventures 

selected cash flows from our joint ventures are set forth in the following table 

 

 capital resources 

total capital consisted of the following 

 

 the increase in total capital from fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2012 was primarily due to additional noncontrolling interests and the redeemable interest generated as a result of the acquisitions of yoplait sas and yoplait marques sas as well as an increase in longterm debt and notes payable as a result of our debt refinancing activities during fiscal 2012 

the following table details the feepaid committed and uncommitted credit lines we had available as of may 27 2012 

 

 to ensure availability of funds we maintain bank credit lines sufficient to cover our outstanding shortterm borrowings commercial paper is a continuing source of shortterm financing we have commercial paper programs available to us in the united states and europe our commercial paper borrowings are supported by 27 billion of feepaid committed credit lines consisting of a 10 billion facility expiring in april 2015 and a 17 billion facility 

  

expiring in april 2017 we also have 394 million in uncommitted credit lines that support our foreign operations as of may 27 2012 there were no amounts outstanding on the feepaid committed credit lines and 114 million was drawn on the uncommitted lines the credit facilities contain several covenants including a requirement to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 25 times 

certain of our longterm debt agreements our credit facilities and our noncontrolling interests contain restrictive covenants as of may 27 2012 we were in compliance with all of these covenants 

we have 741 million of longterm debt maturing in the next 12 months that is classified as current we believe that cash flows from operations together with available short and longterm debt financing will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for at least the next 12 months 

as of may 27 2012 our total debt including the impact of derivative instruments designated as hedges was 71 percent in fixedrate and 29 percent in floatingrate instruments compared to 77 percent in fixedrate and 23 percent in floatingrate instruments on may 29 2011 the change in the fixedrate and floatingrate percentages was driven by the addition of the floatingrate debt consolidated as part of the acquisition of yoplait sas and an increase in notes payable in fiscal 2012 

growth in return on average total capital is one of our key performance measures see the “nongaap measures” section below for our discussion of this measure which is not defined by gaap return on average total capital decreased from 138 percent in fiscal 2011 to 127 percent in fiscal 2012 primarily reflecting the impact of the acquisition of yoplait sas and yoplait marques sas we also believe that the ratio of fixed charge coverage and the ratio of operating cash flow to debt are important measures of our financial strength our fixed charge coverage ratio in fiscal 2012 was 626 compared to 703 in fiscal 2011 the measure decreased from fiscal 2011 as earnings before income taxes and aftertax earnings from joint ventures decreased by 218 million and fixed charges increased by 18 million driven mainly by higher interest and rent expense our operating cash flow to debt ratio increased 101 percentage points to 323 percent in fiscal 2012 primarily driven by an increase of 875 million in cash flows from operations 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 we entered into a purchase agreement with yoki a privately held food company headquartered in sao bernardo do campo brazil for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 197 billion brazilian reals approximately 990 million as of may 27 2012 including the assumption of approximately 220 million brazilian reals approximately 110 million as of may 27 2012 of outstanding debt the purchase price is subject to an adjustment based on the net asset value of the business at the closing date yoki operates in several food categories including snacks convenient meals basic foods and seasonings we expect the transaction to be completed in the first half of fiscal 2013 we expect to fund this transaction using cash available in our foreign subsidiaries and commercial paper 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2012 we acquired a 51 percent controlling interest in yoplait sas and a 50 percent interest in yoplait marques sas sodiaal holds the remaining interests in each of the entities we consolidated both entities into our consolidated financial statements at the date of the acquisition we recorded the 264 million fair value of sodiaal’s 50 percent interest in yoplait marques sas as a noncontrolling interest and the 904 million fair value of its 49 percent interest in yoplait sas as a redeemable interest on our consolidated balance sheets these eurodenominated interests are reported in us dollars on our consolidated balance sheets sodiaal has the ability to put a limited portion of its redeemable interest to us at fair value once per year up to a maximum of 9 years as of may 27 2012 the redemption value of the redeemable interest was 848 million which approximates its fair value 

as of may 27 2012 we also had a noncontrolling interest related to our subsidiary general mills cereals llc gmc we hold all interests in gmc other than class a limited membership interests class a interests which were held by an unrelated thirdparty investor on june 1 2012 subsequent to our year end we restructured gmc through the distribution of its manufacturing assets stock inventory cash and certain intellectual property to a wholly owned subsidiary gmc retained the remaining intellectual property immediately following the restructuring the class a interests were sold by the current holder to another unrelated thirdparty investor 

  

the thirdparty holder of the class a interests receives quarterly preferred distributions from available net income based on the application of a floating preferred return rate currently equal to the sum of threemonth libor plus 110 basis points to the holder’s capital account balance established in the most recent marktomarket valuation currently 252 million the preferred return rate is adjusted every three years through a negotiated agreement with the class a interest holder or through a remarketing auction 

the holder of the class a interests may initiate a liquidation of gmc under certain circumstances including without limitation the bankruptcy of gmc or its subsidiaries gmc’s failure to deliver the preferred distributions on the class a interests gmc’s failure to comply with portfolio requirements breaches of certain covenants lowering of our senior debt rating below either baa3 by moody’s or bbb by standard  poor’s and a failed attempt to remarket the class a interests in the event of a liquidation of gmc each member of gmc will receive the amount of its then current capital account balance the managing member may avoid liquidation by exercising its option to purchase the class a interests 

we may exercise our option to purchase the class a interests for consideration equal to the then current capital account value plus any unpaid preferred return and the prescribed makewhole amount if we purchase these interests any change in the unrelated thirdparty investor’s capital account from its original value will be charged directly to retained earnings and will increase or decrease the net earnings used to calculate eps in that period 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

as of may 27 2012 we have issued guarantees and comfort letters of 398 million for the debt and other obligations of consolidated subsidiaries and guarantees and comfort letters of 335 million for the debt and other obligations of nonconsolidated affiliates mainly cpw in addition offbalance sheet arrangements are generally limited to the future payments under noncancelable operating leases which totaled 338 million as of may 27 2012 

as of may 27 2012 we had invested in five variable interest entities vies none of our vies are material to our results of operations financial condition or liquidity as of and for the year ended may 27 2012 we determined whether or not we were the primary beneficiary pb of each vie using a qualitative assessment that considered the vie’s purpose and design the involvement of each of the interest holders and the risks and benefits of the vie we are the pb of three of the vies we provided minimal financial or other support to our vies during fiscal 2012 and there are no arrangements related to vies that would require us to provide significant financial support in the future 

our defined benefit plans in the united states are subject to the requirements of the pension protection act ppa the ppa revised the basis and methodology for determining defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements as well as maximum contributions to and benefits paid from taxqualified plans most of these provisions were applicable to our domestic defined benefit pension plans in fiscal 2011 the ppa may ultimately require us to make additional contributions to our domestic plans we made 200 million of voluntary contributions to our principal domestic plans in each of fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 we do not expect to be required to make any contributions in fiscal 2013 actual fiscal 2013 contributions could exceed our current projections and may be influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts or by changes in regulatory requirements additionally our projections concerning timing of the ppa funding requirements are subject to change and may be influenced by factors such as general market conditions affecting trust asset performance interest rates and our future decisions regarding certain elective provisions of the ppa 

  

the following table summarizes our future estimated cash payments under existing contractual obligations including payments due by period 

 

     significant accounting estimates 

for a complete description of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report our significant accounting estimates are those that have a meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations these estimates include our accounting for promotional expenditures valuation of longlived assets intangible assets redeemable interest stockbased compensation income taxes and defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefits 

promotional expenditures 

our promotional activities are conducted through our customers and directly or indirectly with end consumers these activities include payments to customers to perform merchandising activities on our behalf such as advertising or instore displays discounts to our list prices to lower retail shelf prices payments to gain distribution of new products coupons contests and other incentives and media and advertising expenditures the media and advertising expenditures are generally recognized as expense when the advertisement airs the cost of payments to customers and other consumerrelated activities are recognized as the related revenue is recorded which generally precedes the actual cash expenditure the recognition of these costs requires estimation of customer participation and performance levels these estimates are made based on the forecasted customer sales the timing and forecasted costs of promotional activities and other factors differences between estimated expenses and actual costs are normally insignificant and are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period our accrued trade coupon and consumer marketing liabilities were 561 million as of may 27 2012 and 463 million as of 

  

may 29 2011 because our total promotional expenditures including amounts classified as a reduction of revenues are significant if our estimates are inaccurate we would have to make adjustments in subsequent periods that could have a material effect on our results of operations 

valuation of longlived assets 

longlived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the asset group are less than the carrying amount of the asset group asset groups have identifiable cash flows independent of other asset groups measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset or asset group over its fair value fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent appraisals as appropriate 

intangible assets 

goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred impairment testing is performed for each of our reporting units we compare the carrying value of a reporting unit including goodwill to the fair value of the unit carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we revalue all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit excluding goodwill to determine if the fair value of the net assets is greater than the net assets including goodwill if the fair value of the net assets is less than the carrying amount of net assets including goodwill impairment has occurred our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our annual longrange planning process we also make estimates of discount rates perpetuity growth assumptions market comparables and other factors we performed our fiscal 2012 assessment as of november 28 2011 and determined there was no impairment of goodwill for any of our reporting units as their related fair values were substantially in excess of their carrying values 

we evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets mainly brands to determine if they are finite or indefinitelived reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry known technological advances legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets intangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized on a straightline basis over their useful lives generally ranging from 4 to 30 years 

our indefinitelived intangible assets mainly intangible assets primarily associated with the pillsbury  totino’s  progresso  green giant  yoplait  old el paso  and häagendazs brands are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable we performed our fiscal 2012 assessment of our brand intangibles as of november 28 2011 our estimate of the fair value of the brands was based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs which included projected revenues from our annual longrange plan assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands and a discount rate as of our assessment date there was no impairment of any of our indefinitelived intangible assets as their related fair values were substantially in excess of the carrying values 

as of may 27 2012 we had 124 billion of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets while we currently believe that the fair value of each intangible exceeds its carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses or a different weightedaverage cost of capital could result in significant impairment losses and amortization expense 

in addition we assess our investments in our joint ventures if we have reason to believe an impairment may have occurred including but not limited to ongoing operating losses projected decreases in earnings increases in the weighted average cost of capital or significant business disruptions the significant assumptions used to estimate fair value include revenue growth and profitability royalty rates capital spending depreciation and taxes foreign currency exchange rates and a discount rate by their nature these projections and assumptions are uncertain if we were to determine the current fair value of our investment was less than the carrying value of the investment then we would assess if the shortfall was of a temporary or permanent nature and write down the investment to its fair value if we concluded the impairment is other than temporary 

  

redeemable interest 

on july 1 2011 we acquired a 51 percent controlling interest in yoplait sas a consolidated entity sodiaal holds the remaining 49 percent interest in yoplait sas sodiaal has the ability to put a limited portion of its redeemable interest to us at fair value once per year up to a maximum of 9 years this put option requires us to classify sodiaal’s interest as a redeemable interest outside of equity on our consolidated balance sheets for as long as the put is exercisable by sodiaal when the put is no longer exercisable the redeemable interest will be reclassified to noncontrolling interests on our consolidated balance sheets we adjust the value of the redeemable interest through additional paidin capital on our consolidated balance sheets quarterly to the redeemable interest’s redemption value which approximates its fair value during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 we adjusted the redeemable interest’s redemption value based on a discounted cash flow model the significant assumptions used to estimate the redemption value include projected revenue growth and profitability from our long range plan capital spending depreciation and taxes foreign currency rates and a discount rate 

stockbased compensation 

the valuation of stock options is a significant accounting estimate that requires us to use judgments and assumptions that are likely to have a material impact on our financial statements annually we make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility employee exercise behavior dividend yield and the forfeiture rate 

we estimate our future stock price volatility using the historical volatility over the expected term of the option excluding time periods of volatility we believe a marketplace participant would exclude in estimating our stock price volatility we also have considered but did not use implied volatility in our estimate because trading activity in options on our stock especially those with tenors of greater than 6 months is insufficient to provide a reliable measure of expected volatility if all other assumptions are held constant a one percentage point increase in our fiscal 2012 volatility assumption would increase the grantdate fair value of our fiscal 2012 option awards by 6 percent 

our expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical data to estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model separate groups of employees have similar historical exercise behavior and therefore were aggregated into a single pool for valuation purposes the weightedaverage expected term for all employee groups is presented in the table below an increase in the expected term by 1 year leaving all other assumptions constant would change the grant date fair value by 17 percent 

the riskfree interest rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based on the us treasury zerocoupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant 

the estimated fair values of stock options granted and the assumptions used for the blackscholes optionpricing model were as follows 

 

 to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our assumptions we are not required to true up grantdate fair valuebased expense to final intrinsic values however these differences can impact the classification of cash tax benefits realized upon exercise of stock options as explained in the following two paragraphs furthermore historical data 

  

has a significant bearing on our forwardlooking assumptions significant variances between actual and predicted experience could lead to prospective revisions in our assumptions which could then significantly impact the yearoveryear comparability of stockbased compensation expense 

any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings referred to as a windfall tax benefit is presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows as a financing cash flow the actual impact on future years’ financing cash flow will depend in part on the volume of employee stock option exercises during a particular year and the relationship between the exercisedate market value of the underlying stock and the original grantdate fair value previously determined for financial reporting purposes 

realized windfall tax benefits are credited to additional paidin capital within the consolidated balance sheets realized shortfall tax benefits amounts which are less than that previously recognized in earnings are first offset against the cumulative balance of windfall tax benefits if any and then charged directly to income tax expense potentially resulting in volatility in our consolidated effective income tax rate we calculated a cumulative amount of windfall tax benefits from post1995 fiscal years for the purpose of accounting for future shortfall tax benefits and currently have sufficient cumulative windfall tax benefits to absorb projected arising shortfalls such that we do not currently expect future earnings to be affected by this provision however as employee stock option exercise behavior is not within our control it is possible that materially different reported results could occur if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail 

income taxes 

we apply a morelikelythannot threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions accordingly we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement future changes in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect earnings in the quarter of such change 

we are subject to federal income taxes in the united states as well as various state local and foreign jurisdictions a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position we believe that our liabilities for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome we adjust these liabilities as well as the related interest in light of changing facts and circumstances settlement of any particular position would usually require the use of cash 

the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction our major taxing jurisdictions include the united states federal and state and canada the irs initiated its audit of our fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010 tax years during fiscal 2012 

during fiscal 2012 we reached a settlement with the irs concerning research and development tax credits claimed for fiscal years 2002 to 2008 this settlement did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position as of the end of fiscal 2012 we have effectively settled all issues with the irs for fiscal years 2008 and prior 

during fiscal 2011 we reached a settlement with the irs concerning certain corporate income tax adjustments for fiscal years 2002 to 2008 the adjustments primarily relate to the amount of capital loss depreciation and amortization we reported as a result of the sale of noncontrolling interests in our gmc subsidiary as a result we recorded a 108 million reduction in our total liabilities for uncertain tax positions in fiscal 2011 we made payments totaling 385 million in fiscal 2011 related to this settlement 

also during fiscal 2011 the superior court of the state of california issued an adverse decision concerning our state income tax apportionment calculations as a result we recorded a 12 million increase in our total liabilities for uncertain tax positions in fiscal 2011 we believe our positions are supported by substantial technical authority and have appealed this decision we do not expect to make a payment related to this matter until it is definitively resolved 

  

various tax examinations by united states state taxing authorities could be conducted for any open tax year which vary by jurisdiction but are generally from 3 to 5 years currently several state examinations are in progress the canada revenue agency cra has completed its review of our income tax returns in canada for fiscal years 2003 to 2005 the cra has raised assessments for these years to which we have objected or otherwise addressed through the mutual agreement procedures of the canadaus tax treaty we believe our positions are supported by substantial technical authority and are vigorously defending our positions we do not anticipate that any united states or canadian tax adjustments will have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 

as of may 27 2012 our total liability for uncertain tax positions and accrued interest and penalties was 281 million we do not expect to pay any amounts related to uncertain tax positions or accrued interest in the next 12 months we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes 

defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefit plans 

defined benefit pension plans 

we have defined benefit pension plans covering most employees in the united states canada france and the united kingdom benefits for salaried employees are based on length of service and final average compensation benefits for hourly employees include various monthly amounts for each year of credited service our funding policy is consistent with the requirements of applicable laws we made 200 million of voluntary contributions to our principal us plans in each of fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 we do not expect to be required to make any contributions in fiscal 2013 our principal domestic retirement plan covering salaried employees has a provision that any excess pension assets would be allocated to active participants if the plan is terminated within five years of a change in control in fiscal 2012 we announced changes to our us defined benefit pension plans all new salaried employees hired on or after june 1 2013 will be eligible for a new retirement program that does not include a defined benefit pension plan current salaried employees will remain in the existing defined benefit pension plan with adjustments to benefits 

other postretirement benefit plans 

we also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to the majority of our retirees in the united states and canada the salaried health care benefit plan is contributory with retiree contributions based on years of service we make decisions to fund related trusts for certain employees and retirees on an annual basis we did not make voluntary contributions to these plans in fiscal 2012 the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 collectively the act was signed into law in march 2010 we continue to evaluate the effect of the act including its potential impact on the future cost of our benefit plans 

postemployment benefit plans 

under certain circumstances we also provide accruable benefits to former or inactive employees in the united states canada and mexico and members of our board of directors including severance and certain other benefits payable upon death we recognize an obligation for any of these benefits that vest or accumulate with service postemployment benefits that do not vest or accumulate with service such as severance based solely on annual pay rather than years of service are charged to expense when incurred our postemployment benefit plans are unfunded 

we recognize benefits provided during retirement or following employment over the plan participants’ active working life accordingly we make various assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement of our obligations assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our net periodic benefit expense or income and accumulated benefit obligations include the longterm rates of return on plan assets the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our benefit plans and the health care cost trend rates 

expected rate of return on plan assets 

our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation our historical longterm investment performance our estimate of future longterm returns by asset class using input from our actuaries investment services and investment managers and longterm inflation assumptions we review this assumption annually for each plan however our annual investment performance for one particular year does not by itself significantly influence our evaluation 

  

the investment objective for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans is to secure the benefit obligations to participants at a reasonable cost to us our goal is to optimize the longterm return on plan assets at a moderate level of risk the defined benefit pension and other postretirement portfolios are broadly diversified across asset classes within asset classes the portfolios are further diversified across investment styles and investment organizations for the defined benefit pension plans the longterm investment policy allocation is 25 percent to equities in the united states 15 percent to international equities 10 percent to private equities 35 percent to fixed income and 15 percent to real assets real estate energy and timber for other postretirement benefit plans the longterm investment policy allocations are 30 percent to equities in the united states 20 percent to international equities 10 percent to private equities 30 percent to fixed income and 10 percent to real assets real estate energy and timber the actual allocations to these asset classes may vary tactically around the longterm policy allocations based on relative market valuations 

our historical investment returns compound annual growth rates for our united states defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan assets were 12 percent 23 percent 77 percent 81 percent and 95 percent for the 1 5 10 15 and 20 year periods ended may 27 2012 

on a weightedaverage basis the expected rate of return for all defined benefit plans was 952 percent for fiscal 2012 953 percent for fiscal 2011 and 955 percent for fiscal 2010 during fiscal 2012 we lowered our weightedaverage expected rate of return on plan assets for our principal defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in the united states to 86 percent due to generally lower expectations for longterm rates of return across our asset classes due to the recent global economic slowdown and our expectation of an extended time frame for recovery 

lowering the expected longterm rate of return on assets by 50 basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense by 265 million for fiscal 2013 a marketrelated valuation basis is used to reduce yeartoyear expense volatility the marketrelated valuation recognizes certain investment gains or losses over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the marketrelated value of assets and the actual return based on the marketrelated value of assets our outside actuaries perform these calculations as part of our determination of annual expense or income 

discount rates 

our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of the last day of our fiscal year for our defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefit plan obligations we also use the same discount rates to determine defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefit plan income and expense for the following fiscal year we work with our actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan participants and using the top quartile of aarated corporate bond yields to develop a forward interest rate curve including a margin to that index based on our credit risk this forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions 

our weightedaverage discount rates were as follows 

weightedaverage discount rates 

 

   

lowering the discount rates by 50 basis points would increase our net defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefit plan expense for fiscal 2013 by approximately 418 million all obligationrelated experience gains and losses are amortized using a straightline method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants 

health care cost trend rates 

we review our health care cost trend rates annually our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims experience and information provided by our actuaries this information includes recent plan experience plan design overall industry experience and projections and assumptions used by other similar organizations our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with this review recent experiences and shortterm expectations our initial health care cost trend rate assumption is 85 percent for all retirees rates are graded down annually until the ultimate trend rate of 52 percent is reached in 2019 for all retirees the trend rates are applicable for calculations only if the retirees’ benefits increase as a result of health care inflation the ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually as necessary to approximate the current economic view on the rate of longterm inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium assumed trend rates for health care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans 

a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate would have the following effects 

 

 any arising health care claims costrelated experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculation of expected future claims once recognized experience gains and losses are amortized using a straightline method over 15 years resulting in at least the minimum amortization required being recorded 

financial statement impact 

in fiscal 2012 we recorded net defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefit plan expense of 106 million compared to 95 million of expense in fiscal 2011 and 11 million of income in fiscal 2010 as of may 27 2012 we had cumulative unrecognized actuarial net losses of 17 billion on our defined benefit pension plans and 232 million on our postretirement and postemployment benefit plans mainly as the result of liability increases from lower interest rates and declines in the values of plan assets these unrecognized actuarial net losses will result in increases in our future pension expense and increases in postretirement expense since they currently exceed the corridors defined by gaap 

we use the 2012 irs static mortality table projected forward to our plans’ measurement dates to calculate the yearend defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefit obligations and annual expense 

actual future net defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefit plan income or expense will depend on investment performance changes in future discount rates changes in health care cost trend rates and other factors related to the populations participating in these plans 

the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 collectively the act was signed into law in march 2010 the act codifies health care reforms with staggered effective dates from 2010 to 2018 with many provisions in the act requiring the issuance of additional guidance from various government agencies estimates of the future impacts of several of the act’s provisions are incorporated into our postretirement benefit liability including the elimination of lifetime maximums and the imposition of an excise tax on high cost health plans these changes resulted in a 24 million increase in our 

  

postretirement benefit liability in fiscal 2010 given the complexity of the act the extended time period over which the reforms will be implemented and the unknown impact of future regulatory guidance further financial impacts to our postretirement benefit liability and related future expense may occur 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in june 2011 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new accounting guidance for the presentation of other comprehensive income oci this guidance requires entities to present net income and oci in either a single continuous statement or in separate consecutive statements the guidance does not change the components of net income or oci when oci should be reclassified to net income or the eps calculation the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2011 which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2013 this guidance will not impact our results of operations or financial position 

in december 2011 the fasb issued new accounting disclosure requirements about the nature and exposure of offsetting arrangements related to financial and derivative instruments the requirements are effective for fiscal years beginning after january 1 2013 which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2014 the requirements will not impact our results of operations or financial position 

nongaap measures 

we have included in this report measures of financial performance that are not defined by gaap management and the board of directors believe that these measures provide useful information to investors and include these measures in other communications to investors 

for each of these nongaap financial measures we are providing below a reconciliation of the differences between the nongaap measure and the most directly comparable gaap measure an explanation of why our management or the board of directors believes the nongaap measure provides useful information to investors and any additional purposes for which our management or board of directors uses the nongaap measure these nongaap measures should be viewed in addition to and not in lieu of the comparable gaap measure 

total segment operating profit 

this measure is used in reporting to our executive management and as a component of the board of director’s measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes management and the board of directors believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is the profitability measure we use to evaluate segment performance a reconciliation of this measure to operating profit the relevant gaap measure is included in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

diluted eps excluding certain items affecting comparability 

this measure is used in reporting to our executive management and as a component of the board of director’s measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes management and the board of directors believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is the profitability measure we use to evaluate earnings performance on a comparable yearoveryear basis the adjustments are either items resulting from infrequently occurring events or items that in management’s judgment significantly affect the yearoveryear assessment of operating results 

  

the reconciliation of diluted eps excluding certain items affecting comparability to diluted eps the relevant gaap measure follows 

 

        return on average total capital 

this measure is used in reporting to our executive management and as a component of the board of director’s measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes management and the board of directors believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is important for assessing the utilization of capital and it eliminates certain items which affect yeartoyear comparability 

  

  net sales growth rates for our international segment excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange 

management and the board of directors believe that this measure of our international segment and region net sales provides useful information to investors because it provides transparency to the underlying performance in markets outside the united states by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on yeartoyear comparability given volatility in foreign exchange markets 

to present this information current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than united states dollars are converted into united states dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year rather than the actual average exchange rates in effect during the current fiscal year therefore the foreign currency impact is equal to current year results in local currencies multiplied by the change in the average foreign currency exchange rate between the current fiscal period and the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates commodity prices and equity prices changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows in the normal course of business we actively manage our exposure to these market risks by entering into various hedging transactions authorized under established policies that place clear controls on these activities the counterparties in these transactions are generally highly rated institutions we establish credit limits for each counterparty our hedging transactions include but are not limited to a variety of derivative financial instruments 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixedrate debt and existing and future issuances of floatingrate debt primary exposures include us treasury rates libor euribor and commercial paper rates in the united states and europe we use interest rate swaps and forwardstarting interest rate swaps to hedge our exposure to interest rate changes to reduce the volatility of our financing costs and to achieve a desired proportion of fixed versus floatingrate debt based on current and projected market conditions generally under these swaps we agree with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixedrate and floatingrate interest amounts based on an agreed upon notional principal amount 

as of may 27 2012 we had interest rate swaps with 835 million of aggregate notional principal amount outstanding all of which converts fixedrate notes to floatingrate notes 

foreign exchange risk 

foreign currency fluctuations affect our net investments in foreign subsidiaries and foreign currency cash flows related to third party purchases intercompany loans product shipments and foreigndenominated commercial paper we are also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the us dollar our principal exposures are to the australian dollar brazilian real british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese renminbi euro japanese yen swiss franc and mexican peso we mainly use foreign currency forward contracts to selectively hedge our foreign currency cash flow exposures we also generally swap our foreigndenominated commercial paper borrowings and nonfunctional currency intercompany loans back to us dollars or the functional currency the gains or losses on these derivatives offset the foreign currency revaluation gains or losses recorded in earnings on the associated borrowings we generally do not hedge more than 18 months forward 

we also have many net investments in foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in euros we previously hedged a portion of these net investments by issuing eurodenominated commercial paper and foreign exchange forward contracts as of may 27 2012 we had deferred net foreign currency transaction losses of 96 million in aoci associated with hedging activity 

  

commodity price risk 

many commodities we use in the production and distribution of our products are exposed to market price risks we utilize derivatives to manage price risk for our principal ingredients and energy costs including grains oats wheat and corn oils principally soybean nonfat dry milk natural gas and diesel fuel our primary objective when entering into these derivative contracts is to achieve certainty with regard to the future price of commodities purchased for use in our supply chain we manage our exposures through a combination of purchase orders longterm contracts with suppliers exchangetraded futures and options and overthecounter options and swaps we offset our exposures based on current and projected market conditions and generally seek to acquire the inputs at as close to our planned cost as possible 

as of may 27 2012 the net notional value of commodity derivatives was 307 million of which 127 million related to agricultural inputs and 180 million related to energy inputs these contracts relate to inputs that generally will be utilized within the next 12 months 

equity instruments 

equity price movements affect our compensation expense as certain investments made by our employees in our deferred compensation plan are revalued we use equity swaps to manage this risk as of may 27 2012 the net notional amount of our equity swaps was 48 million 

value at risk 

the estimates in the table below are intended to measure the maximum potential fair value we could lose in one day from adverse changes in market interest rates foreign exchange rates commodity prices and equity prices under normal market conditions a monte carlo valueatrisk var methodology was used to quantify the market risk for our exposures the models assumed normal market conditions and used a 95 percent confidence level 

the var calculation used historical interest rates foreign exchange rates and commodity and equity prices from the past year to estimate the potential volatility and correlation of these rates in the future the market data were drawn from the riskmetrics™ data set the calculations are not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that we expect to incur further since the hedging instrument the derivative inversely correlates with the underlying exposure we would expect that any loss or gain in the fair value of our derivatives would be generally offset by an increase or decrease in the fair value of the underlying exposure the positions included in the calculations were debt investments interest rate swaps foreign exchange forwards commodity swaps futures and options and equity instruments the calculations do not include the underlying foreign exchange and commodities or equityrelated positions that are offset by these marketrisksensitive instruments 

the table below presents the estimated maximum potential var arising from a oneday loss in fair value for our interest rate foreign currency commodity and equity marketrisksensitive instruments outstanding as of may 27 2012 and may 29 2011 and the average fair value impact during the year ended may 27 2012

competition 

the consumer foods industry is highly competitive with numerous manufacturers of varying sizes in the united states and throughout the world the food categories in which we participate are very competitive our principal competitors in these categories all have 

  substantial financial marketing and other resources competition in our product categories is based on product innovation product quality price brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing promotional activity and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences our principal strategies for competing in each of our segments include effective customer relationships superior product quality innovative advertising product promotion product innovation an efficient supply chain and price in most product categories we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products but also with generic and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices internationally we compete with both multinational and local manufacturers and each country includes a unique group of competitors 

seasonality 

in general demand for our products is evenly balanced throughout the year however within our us retail segment demand for refrigerated dough frozen baked goods and baking products is stronger in the fourth calendar quarter demand for progresso soup and green giant canned and frozen vegetables is higher during the fall and winter months internationally demand for häagendazs ice cream is higher during the summer months and demand for baking mix and dough products increases during winter months due to the offsetting impact of these demand trends as well as the different seasons in the northern and southern hemispheres our international segment net sales are generally evenly balanced throughout the year 

backlog 

orders are generally filled within a few days of receipt and are subject to cancellation at any time prior to shipment the backlog of any unfilled orders as of may 29 2011 was not material 

working capital 

a description of our working capital is included in the liquidity section of mda in item 7 of this report our product return practices are described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report

food quality and safety regulation 

the manufacture and sale of consumer food products is highly regulated in the united states our activities are subject to regulation by various federal government agencies including the food and drug administration department of agriculture federal trade commission department of commerce and environmental protection agency as well as various state and local agencies our business is also regulated by similar agencies outside of the united states 

environmental matters 

as of may 29 2011 we were involved with three active cleanup sites associated with the alleged or threatened release of hazardous substances or wastes located in sauget illinois minneapolis minnesota and moonachie new jersey these matters involve several different actions including administrative proceedings commenced by regulatory agencies and demand letters by regulatory agencies and private parties 

we recognize that our potential exposure with respect to any of these sites may be joint and several but have concluded that our probable aggregate exposure is not material to our consolidated financial position or cash flows from operations this conclusion is based upon among other things our payments and accruals with respect to each site the number ranking and financial strength of other potentially responsible parties the status of the proceedings including various settlement agreements consent decrees or court orders allocations of volumetric waste contributions and allocations of relative responsibility among potentially responsible parties developed by regulatory agencies and by private parties remediation cost estimates prepared by governmental authorities or private technical consultants and our historical experience in negotiating and settling disputes with respect to similar sites 

our operations are subject to the clean air act clean water act resource conservation and recovery act comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act and all similar state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations applicable to the jurisdictions in which we operate 

based on current facts and circumstances we believe that neither the results of our environmental proceedings nor our compliance in general with environmental laws or regulations will have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position

 item 1a   risk factors tableend 

our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties any of the risks described below could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the food categories in which we participate are very competitive and if we are not able to compete effectively our results of operations could be adversely affected 

the food categories in which we participate are very competitive our principal competitors in these categories all have substantial financial marketing and other resources in most product categories we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products but also with generic and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices competition in our product categories is based on product innovation product quality price brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing promotional activity and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences if our large competitors were to seek an advantage through pricing or promotional changes we could choose to do the same which could adversely affect our margins and profitability if we did not do the same our revenues and market share could be adversely affected our market share and revenue growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing innovative products in response to changing consumer demands or by new product introductions of our competitors if we are unable to build and sustain brand equity by offering recognizably superior product quality we may be unable to maintain premium pricing over generic and private label products 

we may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face of a consolidating retail environment 

the five largest customers in our us retail segment accounted for 53 percent of its net sales for fiscal 2011 the five largest customers in our international segment accounted for 24 percent of its net sales for fiscal 2011 and the five largest customers in our bakeries and foodservice segment accounted for 45 percent of its net sales for fiscal 2011 the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could adversely affect our sales and profits in addition large retail customers may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency lower pricing increased reliance on their own brand name products increased emphasis on generic and other economy brands and increased promotional programs if we are unable to use our scale marketing expertise product innovation knowledge of consumers’ needs and category leadership positions to respond to these demands our profitability or volume growth could be negatively impacted 

price changes for the commodities we depend on for raw materials packaging and energy may adversely affect our profitability 

the principal raw materials that we use are commodities that experience price volatility caused by external conditions such as weather product scarcity limited sources of supply commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations commodity price changes may result in unexpected increases in raw material packaging and energy costs if we are unable to increase productivity to offset these increased costs or increase our prices we may experience reduced margins and profitability we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and the risk management procedures that we do use may not always work as we intend 

  volatility in the market value of derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices will cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings 

we utilize derivatives to manage price risk for some of our principal ingredient and energy costs including grains oats wheat and corn oils principally soybean nonfat dry milk natural gas and diesel fuel changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded in earnings currently resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings these gains and losses are reported in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of earnings and in unallocated corporate items in our segment operating results until we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating profit we also record our grain inventories at fair value we may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments 

if we are not efficient in our production our profitability could suffer as a result of the highly competitive environment in which we operate 

our future success and earnings growth depends in part on our ability to be efficient in the production and manufacture of our products in highly competitive markets gaining additional efficiencies may become more difficult over time our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or by eliminating redundant costs resulting from acquisitions could adversely affect our profitability and weaken our competitive position many productivity initiatives involve complex reorganization of manufacturing facilities and production lines such manufacturing realignment may result in the interruption of production which may negatively impact product volume and margins 

disruption of our supply chain could adversely affect our business 

our ability to make move and sell products is critical to our success damage or disruption to raw material supplies or our manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather including any potential effects of climate change natural disaster fire terrorism pandemic strikes import restrictions or other factors could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or to effectively manage such events if they occur particularly when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location could adversely affect our business and results of operations as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain 

concerns with the safety and quality of food products could cause consumers to avoid certain food products or ingredients 

we could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients adverse publicity about these types of concerns whether or not valid may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions 

if our food products become adulterated misbranded or mislabeled we might need to recall those items and may experience product liability claims if consumers are injured 

we may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated misbranded or mislabeled a widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time we could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us a significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity damage to our reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in our food products which could have an adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands 

we may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and trends which may result in decreased demand for our products 

our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes and eating habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences consumer preferences change from time to time and can be affected by a number of different trends our failure to anticipate identify or react to these changes and trends or to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis could result in reduced demand for our products which would in turn cause our revenues and profitability to suffer similarly demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns regarding the health effects of ingredients such as sodium trans fats sugar processed wheat or other product ingredients or attributes 

we may be unable to grow our market share or add products that are in faster growing and more profitable categories 

the food industry’s growth potential is constrained by population growth our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business faster than populations are growing in the markets that we serve one way to achieve that growth is to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new products in faster growing and more profitable categories our future results will also depend on our ability to increase market share in our existing product categories if we do not succeed in developing innovative products for new and existing categories our growth may slow which could adversely affect our profitability 

  customer demand for our products may be limited in future periods as a result of increased purchases in response to promotional activity 

our unit volume in the last week of each quarter can be higher than the average for the preceding weeks of the quarter in certain circumstances in comparison to the average daily shipments in the first 12 weeks of a quarter the final week of each quarter may have as much as four days’ worth of incremental shipments based on a fiveday week reflecting increased promotional activity at the end of the quarter this increased activity includes promotions to assure that our customers have sufficient inventory on hand to support major marketing events or increased seasonal demand early in the next quarter as well as promotions intended to help achieve interim unit volume targets if due to quarterend promotions or other reasons our customers purchase more product in any reporting period than endconsumer demand will require in future periods our sales level in future reporting periods could be adversely affected 

economic downturns could limit consumer demand for our products 

the willingness of consumers to purchase our products depends in part on local economic conditions in periods of economic uncertainty consumers may purchase more generic private label and other economy brands and may forego certain purchases altogether in those circumstances we could experience a reduction in sales of higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings in addition as a result of economic conditions or competitive actions we may be unable to raise our prices sufficiently to protect margins consumers may also reduce the amount of food that they consume away from home at customers that purchase products from our bakeries and foodservice segment any of these events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

our international operations are subject to political and economic risks 

in fiscal 2011 19 percent of our consolidated net sales were generated outside of the united states we are accordingly subject to a number of risks relating to doing business internationally any of which could significantly harm our business these risks include 

 

 

 

 

 

our financial performance on a us dollar denominated basis is subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates these fluctuations could cause material variations in our results of operations our principal exposures are to the australian dollar british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese renminbi euro japanese yen and mexican peso from time to time we enter into agreements that are intended to reduce the effects of our exposure to currency fluctuations but these agreements may not be effective in significantly reducing our exposure 

new regulations or regulatorybased claims could adversely affect our business 

food production and marketing are highly regulated by a variety of federal state local and foreign agencies changes in laws or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements on us including regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could increase our cost of doing business or restrict our actions causing our results of operations to be adversely affected in addition we advertise our products and could be the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal state and foreign laws and regulations we may also be subject to new laws or regulations restricting our right to advertise products including the interagency working group on food marketed to children preliminary proposed nutrition principles to guide industry selfregulatory efforts and other proposals to limit advertising to children 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could limit financing and other options and in some cases adversely affect our ability to pay dividends 

as of may 29 2011 we had total debt and noncontrolling interests of 71 billion the agreements under which we have issued indebtedness do not prevent us from incurring additional unsecured indebtedness in the future our level of indebtedness may limit our 

   

 

there are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments and noncontrolling interests if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the related indebtedness and other unrelated indebtedness could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity and our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing may also be adversely affected 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt and other obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control 

global capital and credit market issues could negatively affect our liquidity increase our costs of borrowing and disrupt the operations of our suppliers and customers 

the global capital and credit markets including commercial paper markets have experienced increased volatility and disruption making it more difficult for companies to access those markets we depend on stable liquid and wellfunctioning capital and credit markets to fund our operations although we believe that our operating cash flows financial assets access to capital and credit markets and revolvingcredit agreements will permit us to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing our business could also be negatively impacted if our suppliers or customers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy 

volatility in the securities markets interest rates and other factors or changes in our employee base could substantially increase our defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefit costs 

we sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the united states canada and various foreign locations including defined benefit pension retiree health and welfare severance directors’ life and other postemployment plans our major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments changes in interest rates mortality rates health care costs early retirement rates investment returns and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plans a significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations 

our business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately 

the efficient operation of our business depends on our information technology systems we rely on our information technology systems to effectively manage our business data communications supply chain order entry and fulfillment and other business processes the failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in transaction errors processing inefficiencies and the loss of sales and customers causing our business and results of operations to suffer in addition our information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control including fire natural disasters systems failures security breaches and viruses any such damage or interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business 

if other potentially responsible parties prps are unable to contribute to remediation costs at certain contaminated sites our costs for remediation could be material 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign environmental and health and safety laws and regulations under certain of these laws namely the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and its state counterparts liability for investigation and remediation of hazardous substance contamination at currently or formerly owned or operated facilities or at thirdparty waste disposal sites is joint and several we currently are involved in active remediation efforts at certain sites where we have been named a prp if other prps at these sites are unable to contribute to remediation costs we could be held responsible for their portion of the remediation costs and those costs could be material we cannot assure that our costs in relation to these environmental matters or compliance with environmental laws in general will not exceed our established liabilities or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

  a change in the assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses or a different weightedaverage cost of capital used to value our reporting units or our indefinitelived intangible assets could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth 

goodwill for each of our reporting units is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred we compare the carrying value of the net assets of a reporting unit including goodwill to the fair value of the unit if the fair value of the net assets of the reporting unit is less than the net assets including goodwill impairment has occurred our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our annual longrange planning process we also make estimates of discount rates perpetuity growth assumptions market comparables and other factors while we currently believe that our goodwill is not impaired different assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses could result in significant impairment losses 

we evaluate the useful lives of our intangible assets primarily intangible assets associated with the pillsbury  totino’s  progresso  green giant  old el paso and häagendazs brands to determine if they are finite or indefinitelived reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry known technological advances legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 

our indefinitelived intangible assets are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable our estimate of the fair value of the brands is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs including projected revenues from our annual longrange plan assumed royalty rates which could be payable if we did not own the brands and a discount rate 

as of may 29 2011 we had 105 billion of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets while we currently believe that the fair value of each intangible exceeds its carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses or a different weightedaverage cost of capital could result in significant impairment losses and amortization expense 

our failure to successfully integrate acquisitions into our existing operations could adversely affect our financial results 

from time to time we evaluate potential acquisitions or joint ventures that would further our strategic objectives our success depends in part upon our ability to integrate acquired and existing operations if we are unable to successfully integrate acquisitions including recently acquired yoplait interests our financial results could suffer additional potential risks associated with acquisitions include additional debt leverage the loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business the assumption of unknown liabilities the inherent risk associated with entering a line of business in which we have no or limited prior experience failure to achieve anticipated synergies and the impairment of goodwill or other acquisitionrelated intangible assets

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend 

executive overview 

we are a global consumer foods company we develop distinctive valueadded food products and market them under unique brand names we work continuously to improve our established products and to create new products that meet consumers’ evolving needs and preferences in addition we build the equity of our brands over time with strong consumerdirected marketing and innovative merchandising we believe our brandbuilding strategy is the key to winning and sustaining leading share positions in markets around the globe 

our fundamental business goal is to generate superior returns for our stockholders over the long term we believe that increases in net sales segment operating profit earnings per share eps and return on average total capital are the key measures of financial performance for our businesses see the “nongaap measures” section below for a description of our discussion of total segment operating profit diluted eps excluding certain items affecting comparability and return on average total capital which are not defined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap 

our objectives are to consistently deliver 

 

 

 

 

we believe that this financial performance coupled with an attractive dividend yield should result in longterm value creation for stockholders we also return a substantial amount of cash to stockholders through share repurchases and dividends 

for the fiscal year ended may 29 2011 our net sales grew 2 percent total segment operating profit grew 4 percent and diluted eps grew 20 percent however our return on average total capital declined by 10 basis points despite these positive earnings metrics diluted eps excluding certain items affecting comparability increased 8 percent from fiscal 2010 see the “nongaap measures” section below for our use of this measure and our discussion of the items affecting comparability net cash provided by operations totaled 15 billion in fiscal 2011 enabling us to increase our annual dividend payments per share by 17 percent from fiscal 2010 and continue returning cash to stockholders through share repurchases which totaled 12 billion in fiscal 2011 we also made significant capital investments totaling 649 million in fiscal 2011 

we achieved the following related to our six key operating objectives for fiscal 2011 

 

 

 

 

 

 

details of our financial results are provided in the “fiscal 2011 consolidated results of operations” section below 

  we expect slow improvement in the operating environment for food companies around the globe although we believe the environment will remain challenging in fiscal 2012 we expect to deliver another year of quality growth excluding the effects of our acquisition of interests in yoplait sas and yoplait marques sas we expect to achieve these results 

 

 

 

our businesses generate strong levels of cash flows we use some of this cash to reinvest in our business our fiscal 2012 plans call for 670 million of expenditures for capital projects excluding expenditures that may be required for yoplait sas on june 28 2011 our board of directors approved a dividend increase to an annual rate of 122 per share a 9 percent increase from the rate paid in fiscal 2011 

as a result of the acquisition of interests in yoplait entities we expect to reduce our level of share repurchases in fiscal 2012 we expect that share repurchases will offset normal levels of stock option exercises in fiscal 2012

components of net sales growth 

 

 

net sales grew 2 percent in fiscal 2011 due to 1 percentage point of volume growth and 1 percentage point of growth from net price realization and mix foreign exchange was flat compared to fiscal 2010 

cost of sales increased 91 million in fiscal 2011 to 8927 million this increase was driven by 157 million higher net input costs and product mix and an 84 million increase attributable to higher volume partially offset by a 95 million net decrease in cost of sales related to marktomarket valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories as described in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report compared to a net increase of 7 million in fiscal 2010 in fiscal 2010 we recorded a charge of 48 million resulting from a change in the capitalization threshold for certain equipment parts 

gross margin grew 3 percent in fiscal 2011 versus fiscal 2010 gross margin as a percent of net sales increased by 40 basis points from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 these improvements were primarily driven by gains from the marktomarket valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories in fiscal 2011 versus losses in fiscal 2010 

selling general and administrative sga expenses were up 29 million in fiscal 2011 versus fiscal 2010 while sga expenses 

  as a percent of net sales remained essentially flat from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 the increase in sga expenses was primarily driven by a 69 million increase in corporate pension expense partially offset by a 7 percent decrease in advertising and media expense in fiscal 2010 the venezuelan government devalued the bolivar fuerte exchange rate against the us dollar the 14 million foreign exchange loss resulting from the devaluation was substantially offset by a 13 million recovery against a corporate investment 

during fiscal 2011 we recorded a net divestiture gain of 17 million we recorded a gain of 14 million related to the sale of a foodservice frozen baked goods product line in our international segment and a gain of 3 million related to the sale of a pie shell product line in our bakeries and foodservice segment there were no divestitures in fiscal 2010 

interest net for fiscal 2011 totaled 346 million 55 million lower than fiscal 2010 the average interest rate on our total outstanding debt was 56 percent in fiscal 2011 compared to 63 percent in fiscal 2010 generating a 45 million decrease in net interest average interest bearing instruments increased 474 million in fiscal 2011 primarily due to more share repurchases than in fiscal 2010 leading to a 30 million increase in net interest in fiscal 2010 we also recorded a loss of 40 million related to the repurchase of certain notes which represented the premium paid the writeoff of remaining discount and unamortized fees and the settlement of related swaps 

restructuring impairment and other exit costs totaled 4 million in fiscal 2011 as follows 

 

in fiscal 2011 we decided to exit an underperforming product line in our us retail segment as a result of this decision we concluded that the future cash flows generated by this product line were insufficient to recover the net book value of the associated longlived assets accordingly we recorded a noncash charge of 2 million related to the impairment of the associated longlived assets no employees were affected by these actions in addition we recorded 3 million of charges associated with restructuring actions previously announced in fiscal 2011 we paid 6 million in cash related to restructuring actions taken in fiscal 2011 and previous years 

our consolidated effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 was 297 percent compared to 350 percent in fiscal 2010 the 53 percentage point decrease was primarily due to a 100 million reduction to tax expense recorded in fiscal 2011 related to a settlement with the internal revenue service irs concerning corporate income tax adjustments for fiscal years 2002 to 2008 the adjustments primarily relate to the amount of capital loss depreciation and amortization we reported as a result of the sale of noncontrolling interests in our general mills cereals llc gmc subsidiary fiscal 2010 income tax expense included a 35 million increase related to the enactment of federal health care reform the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 this legislation changed the tax treatment of subsidies to companies that provide prescription drug benefits that are at least the equivalent of benefits under medicare part d see the “impact of inflation” section below for additional discussion of this legislation 

aftertax earnings from joint ventures for fiscal 2011 decreased to 96 million compared to 102 million in fiscal 2010 the decrease is primarily due to higher advertising and media spending and increased service cost allocations all in cpw in fiscal 2011 cpw net sales grew by 3 percent due to a 2 percentage point increase in volume and a 1 percentage point increase from favorable foreign exchange net price realization and mix was flat compared to fiscal 2010 net sales for hdj increased 4 percent from fiscal 2010 primarily due to 9 percentage points of favorable foreign exchange partially offset by a 5 percentage point decline in net price realization and mix volume was flat compared to fiscal 2010

selected cash flows from joint ventures 

 

impact of inflation 

we have experienced significant input cost volatility since fiscal 2006 our gross margin performance in fiscal 2011 reflects the impact of input cost inflation primarily on commodities inputs we expect the cost of commodities and energy to increase at a higher rate in fiscal 2012 we attempt to minimize the effects of inflation through planning and operating practices our risk management practices are discussed in item 7a of this report 

the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 collectively the act was signed into law in march 2010 the act codifies health care reforms with staggered effective dates from 2010 to 2018 many provisions in the act require the issuance of additional guidance from various government agencies because the act does not take effect fully until future years the act did not have a material impact on our fiscal 2011 or 2010 results of operations given the complexity of the act the extended time period over which the reforms will be implemented and the unknown impact of future regulatory guidance the full impact of the act on future periods will not be known until those regulations are adopted 

liquidity 

the primary source of our liquidity is cash flow from operations over the most recent threeyear period our operations have generated 55 billion in cash a substantial portion of this operating cash flow has been returned to stockholders through share 

  repurchases and dividends we also use this source of liquidity to fund our capital expenditures we typically use a combination of cash notes payable and longterm debt to finance acquisitions and major capital expansions 

cash flows from operations 

 

in fiscal 2011 our operations generated 15 billion of cash compared to 22 billion in fiscal 2010 the 654 million decrease primarily reflects an 864 million increased use of cash for net current assets and liabilities and a 200 million voluntary contribution to our principal domestic pension plans partially offset by the 268 million increase in net earnings and a 183 million change in deferred income taxes primarily related to our pension plan contribution and a change in tax legislation related to depreciation deductions 

the increased use of cash for net current assets and liabilities reflects lower other current liabilities primarily reflecting changes in the timing of marketing activities and related accruals and a payment of 385 million in fiscal 2011 related to our irs settlement as described in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report in addition inventories used 223 million more cash in fiscal 2011 reflecting increased input costs

in fiscal 2010 our operations generated 22 billion of cash compared to 18 billion in fiscal 2009 primarily reflecting the 221 million increase in net earnings including earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests 

cash flows from investing activities 

 

in fiscal 2011 cash used by investing activities decreased by 6 million from fiscal 2010 the decreased use of cash reflects 25 million of proceeds from the divestiture of a foodservice frozen baked goods product line in our international segment and 9 million of proceeds from the sale of a pie shell product line in our bakeries and foodservice segment in fiscal 2011 in addition in fiscal 

  2011 we paid 85 million for the acquisition of the mountain high yoghurt business for our us retail segment and 38 million for the acquisition of the pasta master meals business in australia for our international segment we also invested 131 million in affiliates in fiscal 2010 mainly our cpw joint venture to repay local borrowings 

in fiscal 2010 cash used by investing activities increased by 432 million from fiscal 2009 primarily due to 245 million of proceeds from the sale of certain product lines in fiscal 2009 and 41 million of insurance proceeds received in fiscal 2009 from the settlement with the insurance carrier covering the loss at our la salteña pasta manufacturing facility in argentina we also invested 131 million in affiliates in fiscal 2010 

we expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately 670 million in fiscal 2012 excluding any expenditures required to support yoplait sas these expenditures support initiatives that are expected to increase manufacturing capacity for grain snacks continue hmm initiatives throughout the supply chain expand international production capacity for bugles  nature valley bars and häagendazs products and integrate fiscal 2011 acquisitions 

cash flows from financing activities 

 

net cash used by financing activities decreased by 567 million in fiscal 2011 

in may 2011 we issued 300 million aggregate principal amount of 155 percent fixedrate notes and 400 million aggregate principal amount of floatingrate notes both due may 16 2014 the proceeds of these notes were used to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper the floatingrate notes bear interest equal to threemonth libor plus 35 basis points subject to quarterly reset interest on the floatingrate notes is payable quarterly in arrears interest on the fixedrate notes is payable semiannually in arrears the fixedrate notes may be redeemed at our option at any time for a specified make whole amount these notes are senior unsecured unsubordinated obligations that include a change of control repurchase provision 

in june 2010 we issued 500 million aggregate principal amount of 54 percent notes due 2040 the proceeds of these notes were used to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper interest on these notes is payable semiannually in arrears these notes may be redeemed at our option at any time for a specified make whole amount these notes are senior unsecured unsubordinated obligations that include a change of control repurchase provision 

in may 2010 we paid 437 million to repurchase in a cash tender offer 400 million of our previously issued debt we repurchased 221 million of our 60 percent notes due 2012 and 179 million of our 565 percent notes due 2012 we issued commercial paper to fund the repurchase 

in january 2009 we issued 12 billion aggregate principal amount of 565 percent notes due 2019 in august 2008 we issued 700 million aggregate principal amount of 525 percent notes due 2013 the proceeds of these notes were used to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper interest on these notes is payable semiannually in arrears these notes may be redeemed at our option at any time for a specified makewhole amount these notes are senior unsecured unsubordinated obligations that include a change of control repurchase provision 

during fiscal 2011 we repurchased 32 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 1164 million during fiscal 2010 we repurchased 21 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 692 million during fiscal 2009 we repurchased 40 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 1296 million on june 28 2010 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 100 million shares of our common stock purchases under the authorization can be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions including the use of call options and other derivative instruments rule 10b51 trading plans and accelerated repurchase programs the authorization has no specified termination date 

  dividends paid in fiscal 2011 totaled 729 million or 112 per share a 17 percent per share increase from fiscal 2010 dividends paid in fiscal 2010 totaled 644 million or 096 per share a 12 percent per share increase from fiscal 2009 dividends of 086 per share on june 28 2011 our board of directors approved a dividend increase to an annual rate of 122 per share a 9 percent increase from the rate paid in fiscal 2011 

capital resources 

total capital consisted of the following 

 

the increase in total capital from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 was primarily due to net earnings attributable to general mills of 18 billion and an increase in current and longterm debt partially offset by a decrease in notes payable 

the following table details the feepaid committed and uncommitted credit lines we had available as of may 29 2011 

 

to ensure availability of funds we maintain bank credit lines sufficient to cover our outstanding shortterm borrowings commercial paper is a continuing source of shortterm financing we issue commercial paper in the united states and europe our commercial paper borrowings are supported by 29 billion of feepaid committed credit lines consisting of a 18 billion facility expiring in october 2012 and a 11 billion facility expiring in october 2013 we also have 312 million in uncommitted credit lines that support our foreign operations as of may 29 2011 there were no amounts outstanding on the feepaid committed credit lines and 119 million was drawn on the uncommitted lines the credit facilities contain several covenants including a requirement to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 25 

certain of our longterm debt agreements our credit facilities and our noncontrolling interests contain restrictive covenants as of may 29 2011 we were in compliance with all of these covenants 

on july 1 2011 we acquired a 51 percent controlling interest in yoplait sas and a 50 percent interest in yoplait marques sas for an aggregate purchase price of 12 billion yoplait sas operates yogurt businesses in several countries including france and the united kingdom and oversees franchise relationships around the world yoplait marques sas holds the worldwide rights to yoplait and related trademarks we financed this transaction using cash available in our foreign subsidiaries and commercial paper 

we have 1031 million of longterm debt maturing in the next 12 months that is classified as current primarily 1020 million of 60 percent notes which mature on february 15 2012 we believe that cash flows from operations together with available short and longterm debt financing will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for at least the next 12 months 

as of may 29 2011 our total debt including the impact of derivative instruments designated as hedges was 77 percent in fixedrate and 23 percent in floatingrate instruments compared to 75 percent in fixedrate and 25 percent in floatingrate instruments on may 30 2010 the change in the fixedrate and floatingrate percentages was driven by the issuance of 500 million aggregate principal amount of fixed rate debt and a decrease in notes payable in fiscal 2011 

  we have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the sec covering the sale of debt securities the shelf registration statement will expire in december 2011 

growth in return on average total capital is one of our key performance measures see the “nongaap measures” section below for our discussion of this measure which is not defined by gaap return on average total capital decreased from 138 percent in fiscal 2010 to 137 percent in fiscal 2011 primarily reflecting higher working capital we also believe that the ratio of fixed charge coverage and the ratio of operating cash flow to debt are important measures of our financial strength our fixed charge coverage ratio in fiscal 2011 was 703 compared to 642 in fiscal 2010 the measure increased from fiscal 2010 as earnings before income taxes and aftertax earnings from joint ventures increased by 224 million and fixed charges decreased by 9 million driven mainly by lower interest expense our operating cash flow to debt ratio decreased 117 percentage points to 222 percent in fiscal 2011 driven by a decrease in cash flows from operations and an increase in our yearend debt balance 

in april 2002 we contributed assets to our subsidiary gmc in exchange for the contribution of these assets gmc issued its managing membership interest and its limited preferred membership interests to certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries we continue to hold the entire managing membership interest and therefore direct the operations of gmc 

the thirdparty holder of the class a interests in gmc receives quarterly preferred distributions from available net income based on the application of a floating preferred return rate currently equal to the sum of threemonth libor plus 65 basis points the preferred return rate of the class a interests is adjusted every five years through a negotiated agreement between the class a interest holder and gmc or through a remarketing auction the next remarketing is scheduled to occur in june 2012 and thereafter in fiveyear intervals 

the holder of the class a interests may initiate a liquidation of gmc under certain circumstances including without limitation the bankruptcy of gmc or its subsidiaries gmc’s failure to deliver the preferred distributions on the class a interests gmc’s failure to comply with portfolio requirements breaches of certain covenants lowering of our senior debt rating below either baa3 by moody’s or bbb by standard  poor’s and a failed attempt to remarket the class a interests as a result of gmc’s failure to assist in such remarketing in the event of a liquidation of gmc each member of gmc will receive the amount of its then current capital account balance the managing member may avoid liquidation by exercising its option to purchase the class a interests 

we may exercise our option to purchase the class a interests for consideration equal to the then current capital account value plus any unpaid preferred return and the prescribed makewhole amount if we purchase these interests any change in the unrelated thirdparty investor’s capital account from its original value will be charged directly to retained earnings and will increase or decrease the net earnings used to calculate eps in that period 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

as of may 29 2011 we have issued guarantees and comfort letters of 591 million for the debt and other obligations of consolidated subsidiaries and guarantees and comfort letters of 341 million for the debt and other obligations of nonconsolidated affiliates mainly cpw in addition offbalance sheet arrangements are generally limited to the future payments under noncancelable operating leases which totaled 261 million as of may 29 2011 

as of may 29 2011 we had invested in six variable interest entities vies we determined whether or not we were the primary beneficiary pb of each vie using a qualitative assessment that considered the vie’s purpose and design the involvement of each of the interest holders and the risks and benefits of the vie we have an interest in a contract manufacturer at our former facility in geneva illinois we are the pb and have consolidated this entity this entity had property and equipment with a carrying value of 14 million and longterm debt of 15 million as of may 29 2011 the liabilities recognized as a result of consolidating this entity do not represent additional claims on our general assets the remaining five vies two of which we are not the pb are not material to our results of operations financial condition or liquidity as of and for the year ended may 29 2011 we have provided minimal financial or other support to vies during the current period and there are no arrangements related to vies that would require us to provide significant financial support in the future 

our defined benefit plans in the united states are subject to the requirements of the pension protection act ppa the ppa revised the basis and methodology for determining defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements as well as maximum contributions to and benefits paid from taxqualified plans most of these provisions were applicable to our domestic defined benefit pension plans in fiscal 2011 on a phasedin basis the ppa may ultimately require us to make additional contributions to our domestic plans we did not make a contribution to our principal defined benefit pension plans in fiscal 2010 we made 200 million of voluntary contributions to our principal domestic plans in fiscal 2011 we do not expect to be required to make any contributions in fiscal 2012 actual fiscal 2012 contributions could exceed our current projections and may be influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts or by changes in regulatory requirements additionally our projections concerning timing of the ppa funding requirements are subject to change and may be influenced by factors such as general market conditions affecting trust asset performance interest rates and our future decisions regarding certain elective provisions of the ppa 

  the following table summarizes our future estimated cash payments under existing contractual obligations including payments due by period 

 

 

significant accounting estimates 

for a complete description of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report our significant accounting estimates are those that have a meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations these estimates include our accounting for promotional expenditures valuation of longlived assets intangible assets stockbased compensation income taxes and defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefits 

promotional expenditures 

our promotional activities are conducted through our customers and directly or indirectly with end consumers these activities include payments to customers to perform merchandising activities on our behalf such as advertising or instore displays discounts to our list prices to lower retail shelf prices payments to gain distribution of new products coupons contests and other incentives and media and advertising expenditures the media and advertising expenditures are generally recognized as expense when the advertisement airs the cost of payments to customers and other consumerrelated activities are recognized as the related revenue is recorded which generally precedes the actual cash expenditure the recognition of these costs requires estimation of customer participation and performance levels these estimates are made based on the forecasted customer sales the timing and forecasted costs of promotional activities and other factors differences between estimated expenses and actual costs are normally insignificant and are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period our accrued trade coupon and consumer marketing liabilities were 463 million as of may 29 2011 and 555 million as of may 30 2010 because our total promotional expenditures including amounts classified as a reduction of revenues are significant if our estimates are inaccurate we would have to make adjustments in subsequent periods that could have a material effect on our results of operations 

valuation of longlived assets 

longlived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the asset group are less than the carrying amount of the asset group asset groups have identifiable cash flows independent of other asset groups measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the 

  carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent appraisals as appropriate 

intangible assets 

goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred impairment testing is performed for each of our reporting units we compare the carrying value of a reporting unit including goodwill to the fair value of the unit carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we revalue all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit excluding goodwill to determine if the fair value of the net assets is greater than the net assets including goodwill if the fair value of the net assets is less than the carrying amount of net assets including goodwill impairment has occurred our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our annual longrange planning process we also make estimates of discount rates perpetuity growth assumptions market comparables and other factors we performed our fiscal 2011 assessment as of november 29 2010 and determined there was no impairment of goodwill for any of our reporting units as their related fair values were substantially in excess of their carrying values 

we evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets mainly brands to determine if they are finite or indefinitelived reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry known technological advances legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 

our indefinitelived intangible assets mainly intangible assets primarily associated with the pillsbury  totino’s  progresso  green giant  old el paso  and häagendazs brands are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable we performed our fiscal 2011 assessment of our brand intangibles as of november 29 2010 our estimate of the fair value of the brands was based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs which included projected revenues from our annual longrange plan assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands and a discount rate as of our assessment date there was no impairment of any of our indefinitelived intangible assets as their related fair values were substantially in excess of the carrying values 

as of may 29 2011 we had 105 billion of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets while we currently believe that the fair value of each intangible exceeds its carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses or a different weightedaverage cost of capital could result in significant impairment losses and amortization expense 

in addition we assess our investments in our joint ventures if we have reason to believe an impairment may have occurred including but not limited to ongoing operating losses projected decreases in earnings increases in the weighted average cost of capital or significant business disruptions the significant assumptions used to estimate fair value include revenue growth and profitability royalty rates capital spending depreciation and taxes foreign currency exchange rates and a discount rate by their nature these projections and assumptions are uncertain if we were to determine the current fair value of our investment was less than the carrying value of the investment then we would assess if the shortfall was of a temporary or permanent nature and write down the investment to its fair value if we concluded the impairment is other than temporary 

after the earthquakes and tsunami in japan in march 2011 we assessed the fair value of our investment in hdj and determined that it exceeded the carrying value by approximately 5 percent as of may 29 2011 the carrying value of hdj consisted of our investment of 61 million and goodwill of 524 million sustained declines in business results or an increase in the weighted average cost of capital may adversely affect the fair value of our investment in hdj and could result in a future impairment to our investment 

stockbased compensation 

the valuation of stock options is a significant accounting estimate that requires us to use judgments and assumptions that are likely to have a material impact on our financial statements annually we make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility employee exercise behavior dividend yield and the forfeiture rate 

we estimate our future stock price volatility using the historical volatility over the expected term of the option excluding time periods of volatility we believe a marketplace participant would exclude in estimating our stock price volatility we also have considered but did not use implied volatility in our estimate because trading activity in options on our stock especially those with tenors of greater than 6 months is insufficient to provide a reliable measure of expected volatility if all other assumptions are held constant a one percentage point increase in our fiscal 2011 volatility assumption would increase the grantdate fair value of our fiscal 2011 option awards by 5 percent 

  our expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical data to estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model separate groups of employees have similar historical exercise behavior and therefore were aggregated into a single pool for valuation purposes the weightedaverage expected term for all employee groups is presented in the table below an increase in the expected term by 1 year leaving all other assumptions constant would change the grant date fair value by 16 percent 

the riskfree interest rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based on the us treasury zerocoupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant 

the estimated fair values of stock options granted and the assumptions used for the blackscholes optionpricing model were as follows 

 

to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our assumptions we are not required to true up grantdate fair valuebased expense to final intrinsic values however these differences can impact the classification of cash tax benefits realized upon exercise of stock options as explained in the following two paragraphs furthermore historical data has a significant bearing on our forwardlooking assumptions significant variances between actual and predicted experience could lead to prospective revisions in our assumptions which could then significantly impact the yearoveryear comparability of stockbased compensation expense 

any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings referred to as a windfall tax benefit is presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows as a financing cash flow the actual impact on future years’ financing cash flow will depend in part on the volume of employee stock option exercises during a particular year and the relationship between the exercisedate market value of the underlying stock and the original grantdate fair value previously determined for financial reporting purposes 

realized windfall tax benefits are credited to additional paidin capital within the consolidated balance sheets realized shortfall tax benefits amounts which are less than that previously recognized in earnings are first offset against the cumulative balance of windfall tax benefits if any and then charged directly to income tax expense potentially resulting in volatility in our consolidated effective income tax rate we calculated a cumulative amount of windfall tax benefits from post1995 fiscal years for the purpose of accounting for future shortfall tax benefits and currently have sufficient cumulative windfall tax benefits to absorb projected arising shortfalls such that we do not currently expect future earnings to be affected by this provision however as employee stock option exercise behavior is not within our control it is possible that materially different reported results could occur if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail 

income taxes 

we apply a morelikelythannot threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions accordingly we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement future changes in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect earnings in the quarter of such change 

we are subject to federal income taxes in the united states as well as various state local and foreign jurisdictions a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position we believe that our liabilities for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome we adjust these liabilities as well as the related interest in light of changing facts and circumstances settlement of any particular position would usually require the use of cash 

the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction our major taxing jurisdictions include the united states federal and state and canada the irs has completed its review of our federal income tax returns for fiscal years 2008 and prior and has proposed adjustments related to the amount of research and development tax credits claimed we have appealed these proposed adjustments 

during fiscal 2011 we reached a settlement with the irs concerning certain corporate income tax adjustments for fiscal years 2002 to 

  2008 the adjustments primarily relate to the amount of capital loss depreciation and amortization we reported as a result of the sale of noncontrolling interests in our gmc subsidiary as a result we recorded a 108 million reduction in our total liabilities for uncertain tax positions in fiscal 2011 we made payments totaling 385 million in fiscal 2011 related to this settlement in addition we made a payment of 18 million in fiscal 2009 related to adjustments made at the irs exam level for audits of fiscal years 2004 to 2006 

also during fiscal 2011 the superior court of the state of california issued an adverse decision concerning our state income tax apportionment calculations as a result we recorded a 12 million increase in our total liabilities for uncertain tax positions we believe our positions are supported by substantial technical authority and have appealed this decision we do not expect to make a payment related to this matter until it is definitively resolved 

in fiscal 2009 the us court of appeals for the eighth circuit issued an opinion reversing a district court decision rendered in fiscal 2008 as a result we recorded 53 million including interest of income tax expense in fiscal 2009 related to the reversal of cumulative income tax benefits from this uncertain tax matter recognized in fiscal years 1992 through 2008 all outstanding liabilities associated with this matter were paid during fiscal 2011 

various tax examinations by united states state taxing authorities could be conducted for any open tax year which vary by jurisdiction but are generally from 3 to 5 years currently several state examinations are in progress the canada revenue agency cra has completed its review of our income tax returns in canada for fiscal years 2003 to 2005 the cra has raised assessments for these years that we are currently appealing we believe our positions are supported by substantial technical authority and are vigorously defending our positions we do not anticipate that any united states or canadian tax adjustments will have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 

as of may 29 2011 our total liability for uncertain tax positions and the associated accrued interest and penalties was 280 million we do not expect to pay any amounts related to uncertain tax positions or accrued interest in the next 12 months we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes 

defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefit plans 

defined benefit pension plans 

we have defined benefit pension plans covering most united states canadian and united kingdom employees benefits for salaried employees are based on length of service and final average compensation benefits for hourly employees include various monthly amounts for each year of credited service our funding policy is consistent with the requirements of applicable laws we made 200 million of voluntary contributions to our principal domestic plans in fiscal 2011 we do not expect to be required to make any contributions in fiscal 2012 our principal domestic retirement plan covering salaried employees has a provision that any excess pension assets would be allocated to active participants if the plan is terminated within five years of a change in control 

other postretirement benefit plans 

we also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to the majority of our united states and canadian retirees the salaried health care benefit plan is contributory with retiree contributions based on years of service we make decisions to fund related trusts for certain employees and retirees on an annual basis we did not make voluntary contributions to these plans in fiscal 2011 the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 was signed into law in march 2010 we have not fully evaluated the effect of the act including possible modifications to provider plans but it could affect the future cost of our benefit plans 

postemployment benefit plans 

under certain circumstances we also provide accruable benefits to former or inactive employees in the united states canada and mexico and members of our board of directors including severance and certain other benefits payable upon death we recognize an obligation for any of these benefits that vest or accumulate with service postemployment benefits that do not vest or accumulate with service such as severance based solely on annual pay rather than years of service are charged to expense when incurred our postemployment benefit plans are unfunded 

we recognize benefits provided during retirement or following employment over the plan participants’ active working life accordingly we make various assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement of our obligations assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our net periodic benefit expense or income and accumulated benefit obligations include the longterm rates of return on plan assets the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our benefit plans and the health care cost trend rates 

  expected rate of return on plan assets 

our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation our historical longterm investment performance our estimate of future longterm returns by asset class using input from our actuaries investment services and investment managers and longterm inflation assumptions we review this assumption annually for each plan however our annual investment performance for one particular year does not by itself significantly influence our evaluation 

the investment objective for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans is to secure the benefit obligations to participants at a reasonable cost to us our goal is to optimize the longterm return on plan assets at a moderate level of risk the defined benefit pension and other postretirement portfolios are broadly diversified across asset classes within asset classes the portfolios are further diversified across investment styles and investment organizations for the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans the longterm investment policy allocations are 30 percent to equities in the united states 20 percent to international equities 10 percent to private equities 30 percent to fixed income and 10 percent to real assets real estate energy and timber the actual allocations to these asset classes may vary tactically around the longterm policy allocations based on relative market valuations 

our historical investment returns compound annual growth rates for our united states defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan assets were 203 percent 56 percent 75 percent 92 percent and 100 percent for the 1 5 10 15 and 20 year periods ended may 29 2011 

our principal defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in the united states have an expected return on plan assets of 96 percent on a weightedaverage basis the expected rate of return for all defined benefit plans was 953 percent for fiscal 2011 955 percent for fiscal 2010 and 955 percent for fiscal 2009 

lowering the expected longterm rate of return on assets by 50 basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense by 24 million for fiscal 2012 a marketrelated valuation basis is used to reduce yeartoyear expense volatility the marketrelated valuation recognizes certain investment gains or losses over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the marketrelated value of assets and the actual return based on the marketrelated value of assets our outside actuaries perform these calculations as part of our determination of annual expense or income 

discount rates 

our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of the last day of our fiscal year for our defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefit plan obligations we also use the same discount rates to determine defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefit plan income and expense for the following fiscal year we work with our actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan participants and using the top quartile of aarated corporate bond yields to develop a forward interest rate curve including a margin to that index based on our credit risk this forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions 

our weightedaverage discount rates were as follows 

weightedaverage discount rates 

 

lowering the discount rates by 50 basis points would increase our net defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefit plan expense for fiscal 2012 by approximately 369 million all obligationrelated experience gains and losses are amortized using a straightline method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants 

health care cost trend rates 

we review our health care cost trend rates annually our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims experience and information provided by our actuaries this information includes recent plan experience plan design overall industry experience and projections and assumptions used by other similar organizations our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to 

  remain consistent with this review recent experiences and shortterm expectations our initial health care cost trend rate assumption is 85 percent for all retirees rates are graded down annually until the ultimate trend rate of 52 percent is reached in 2019 for all retirees the trend rates are applicable for calculations only if the retirees’ benefits increase as a result of health care inflation the ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually as necessary to approximate the current economic view on the rate of longterm inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium assumed trend rates for health care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans 

a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate would have the following effects 

 

any arising health care claims costrelated experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculation of expected future claims once recognized experience gains and losses are amortized using a straightline method over 15 years resulting in at least the minimum amortization required being recorded 

financial statement impact 

in fiscal 2011 we recorded net defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefit plan expense of 95 million compared to 11 million of income in fiscal 2010 and 4 million of income in fiscal 2009 as of may 29 2011 we had cumulative unrecognized actuarial net losses of 13 billion on our defined benefit pension plans and 180 million on our postretirement and postemployment benefit plans mainly as the result of declines in the values of plan assets these unrecognized actuarial net losses will result in increases in our future pension expense and increases in postretirement expense since they currently exceed the corridors defined by gaap 

we use the retirement plans rp 2000 mortality table projected forward to our plans’ measurement dates to calculate the yearend defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefit obligations and annual expense 

actual future net defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefit plan income or expense will depend on investment performance changes in future discount rates changes in health care cost trend rates and other factors related to the populations participating in these plans 

the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 was signed into law in march 2010 the act codifies health care reforms with staggered effective dates from 2010 to 2018 with many provisions in the act requiring the issuance of additional guidance from various government agencies estimates of the future impacts of several of the act’s provisions are incorporated into our postretirement benefit liability including the elimination of lifetime maximums and the imposition of an excise tax on high cost health plans these changes resulted in a 24 million increase in our postretirement benefit liability in fiscal 2010 given the complexity of the act the extended time period over which the reforms will be implemented and the unknown impact of future regulatory guidance further financial impacts to our postretirement benefit liability and related future expense may occur 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in may 2011 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new accounting guidance for fair value measurements providing common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements this guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2011 which for us is the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 we do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 

in june 2011 the fasb issued new accounting guidance for the presentation of other comprehensive income oci this guidance requires entities to present net income and oci in either a single continuous statement or in separate consecutive statements the guidance does not change the components of net income or oci when oci should be reclassified to net income or the earnings per share calculation the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2011 which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2013 this guidance will not impact our results of operations or financial position 

  nongaap measures 

we have included in this report measures of financial performance that are not defined by gaap each of the measures is used in reporting to our executive management and as a component of the board of director’s measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes management and the board of directors believe that these measures provide useful information to investors and include these measures in other communications to investors 

for each of these nongaap financial measures we are providing below a reconciliation of the differences between the nongaap measure and the most directly comparable gaap measure an explanation of why our management or the board of directors believes the nongaap measure provides useful information to investors and any additional purposes for which our management or board of directors uses the nongaap measure these nongaap measures should be viewed in addition to and not in lieu of the comparable gaap measure 

total segment operating profit 

management and the board of directors believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is the profitability measure we use to evaluate segment performance a reconciliation of this measure to operating profit the relevant gaap measure is included in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend 

we are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates commodity prices and equity prices changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows in the normal course of business we actively manage our exposure to these market risks by entering into various hedging transactions authorized under established policies that place clear controls on these activities the counterparties in these transactions are generally highly rated institutions we establish credit limits for each counterparty our hedging transactions include but are not limited to a variety of derivative financial instruments 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixedrate debt and existing and future issuances of floatingrate debt primary exposures include us treasury rates libor and commercial paper rates in the united states and europe we use interest rate swaps and forwardstarting interest rate swaps to hedge our exposure to interest rate changes to reduce the volatility of our financing costs and to achieve a desired proportion of fixed versus floatingrate debt based on current and projected market conditions generally under these swaps we agree with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixedrate and floatingrate interest amounts based on an agreed upon notional principal amount 

as of may 29 2011 we had interest rate swaps with 13 billion of aggregate notional principal amount outstanding with a net notional amount of 838 million that converts floatingrate notes to fixed rates 

foreign exchange risk 

foreign currency fluctuations affect our net investments in foreign subsidiaries and foreign currency cash flows related to foreigndenominated commercial paper third party purchases intercompany loans and product shipments we are also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the us dollar our principal exposures are to the australian dollar british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese renminbi euro japanese yen swiss franc and mexican peso we mainly use foreign currency forward contracts to selectively hedge our foreign currency cash flow exposures we also generally swap our foreigndenominated commercial paper borrowings and nonfunctional currency intercompany loans back to us dollars or the functional currency the gains or losses on these derivatives offset the foreign currency revaluation gains or losses recorded in earnings on the associated borrowings we generally do not hedge more than 18 months forward 

we also have many net investments in foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in euros we previously hedged a portion of these net investments by issuing eurodenominated commercial paper and foreign exchange forward contracts as of may 29 2011 we had deferred net foreign currency transaction losses of 96 million in aoci associated with hedging activity 

commodity price risk 

many commodities we use in the production and distribution of our products are exposed to market price risks we utilize derivatives to manage price risk for our principal ingredients and energy costs including grains oats wheat and corn oils principally soybean nonfat dry milk natural gas and diesel fuel our primary objective when entering into these derivative contracts is to achieve certainty with regard to the future price of commodities purchased for use in our supply chain we manage our exposures through a combination of purchase orders longterm contracts with suppliers exchangetraded futures and options and overthecounter options and swaps we offset our exposures based on current and projected market conditions and generally seek to acquire the inputs at as close to our planned cost as possible 

as of may 29 2011 the net notional value of commodity derivatives was 348 million of which 161 million related to agricultural inputs and 187 million related to energy inputs these contracts relate to inputs that generally will be utilized within the next 12 months 

equity instruments 

equity price movements affect our compensation expense as certain investments made by our employees in our deferred compensation plan are revalued we occasionally use equity swaps to manage this risk but no swaps were outstanding as of may 29 2011 

value at risk 

the estimates in the table below are intended to measure the maximum potential fair value we could lose in one day from adverse changes in market interest rates foreign exchange rates commodity prices and equity prices under normal market conditions a 

  monte carlo valueatrisk var methodology was used to quantify the market risk for our exposures the models assumed normal market conditions and used a 95 percent confidence level 

the var calculation used historical interest rates foreign exchange rates and commodity and equity prices from the past year to estimate the potential volatility and correlation of these rates in the future the market data were drawn from the riskmetrics ™ data set the calculations are not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that we expect to incur further since the hedging instrument the derivative inversely correlates with the underlying exposure we would expect that any loss or gain in the fair value of our derivatives would be generally offset by an increase or decrease in the fair value of the underlying exposure the positions included in the calculations were debt investments interest rate swaps foreign exchange forwards commodity swaps futures and options and equity instruments the calculations do not include the underlying foreign exchange and commoditiesrelated positions that are offset by these marketrisksensitive instruments 

the table below presents the estimated maximum potential var arising from a oneday loss in fair value for our interest rate foreign currency commodity and equity marketrisksensitive instruments outstanding as of may 29 2011 and may 30 2010 and the average fair value impact during the year ended may 29 2011

we recognize that our potential exposure with respect to any of these sites may be joint and several but have concluded that our probable aggregate exposure is not material to our consolidated financial position or cash flows from operations this conclusion is based upon among other things our payments and accruals with respect to each site the number ranking and financial strength of other potentially responsible parties the status of the proceedings including various settlement agreements consent decrees or court orders allocations of volumetric waste contributions and allocations of relative responsibility among potentially responsible parties developed by regulatory agencies and by private parties remediation cost estimates prepared by governmental authorities or private technical consultants and our historical experience in negotiating and settling disputes with respect to similar sites

 item 1a   risk factors tableend 

our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties any of the risks described below could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the food categories in which we participate are very competitive and if we are not able to compete effectively our results of operations could be adversely affected 

the food categories in which we participate are very competitive our principal competitors in these categories all have substantial financial marketing and other resources in most product categories we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products but also with generic and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices competition in our product categories is based on product innovation product quality price brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing promotional activity and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences if our large competitors were to decrease their pricing or were to increase their promotional spending we could choose to do the same which could adversely affect our margins and profitability if we did not do the same our revenues and market share could be adversely affected our market share and revenue growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing innovative products in response to changing consumer demands or by new product introductions of our competitors if we are unable to build and sustain brand equity by offering recognizably superior product quality we may be unable to maintain premium pricing over generic and private label products 

we may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face of a consolidating retail environment 

the five largest customers in our us retail segment accounted for 54 percent of its net sales for fiscal 2010 the five largest customers in our international segment accounted for 23 percent of its net sales for fiscal 2010 and the five largest customers in our bakeries and foodservice segment accounted for 45 percent of its net sales for fiscal 2010 the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could adversely affect our sales and profits in addition large retail customers may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency lower pricing increased reliance on their own brand name products increased emphasis on generic and other economy brands and increased promotional programs if we are unable to use our scale marketing expertise product innovation knowledge of consumers’ needs and category leadership positions to respond to these demands our profitability or volume growth could be negatively impacted 

price changes for the commodities we depend on for raw materials packaging and energy may adversely affect our profitability 

the principal raw materials that we use are commodities that experience price volatility caused by external conditions such as weather and product scarcity limited sources of supply commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations and changes in governmental agricultural and energy programs commodity price changes may result in unexpected increases in raw material packaging and energy costs if we are unable to increase productivity to offset these increased costs or increase our prices we may experience reduced margins and profitability we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and the risk management procedures that we do use may not always work as we intend 

volatility in the market value of derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices will cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings 

we utilize derivatives to manage price risk for some of our principal ingredient and energy costs including grains oats wheat and corn oils principally soybean nonfat dry milk natural gas and diesel fuel changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded in earnings currently resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings these gains and losses are reported in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of earnings and in unallocated corporate items in our segment operating results until we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating profit we also record our grain inventories at fair value we may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments 

if we are not efficient in our production our profitability could suffer as a result of the highly competitive environment in which we operate 

our future success and earnings growth depends in part on our ability to be efficient in the production and manufacture of our products in highly competitive markets gaining additional efficiencies may become more difficult over time our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or by eliminating redundant costs resulting from acquisitions could adversely affect our profitability and weaken our competitive position many productivity initiatives involve complex reorganization of manufacturing facilities and production lines such manufacturing realignment may result in the interruption of production which may negatively impact product volume and margins 

disruption of our supply chain could adversely affect our business 

our ability to make move and sell products is critical to our success damage or disruption to raw material supplies or our manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather including any potential effects of climate change natural disaster fire terrorism pandemic strikes import restrictions or other factors could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or to effectively manage such events if they occur particularly when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location could adversely affect our business and results of operations as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain 

concerns with the safety and quality of food products could cause consumers to avoid certain food products or ingredients 

we could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients adverse publicity about these types of concerns whether or not valid may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions 

if our food products become adulterated misbranded or mislabeled we might need to recall those items and may experience product liability claims if consumers are injured 

we may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated misbranded or mislabeled a widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time we could also suffer losses from a significant 

product liability judgment against us a significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity damage to our reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in our food products which could have an adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands 

we may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and trends which may result in decreased demand for our products 

our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes and eating habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences consumer preferences change from time to time and can be affected by a number of different trends our failure to anticipate identify or react to these changes and trends or to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis could result in reduced demand for our products which would in turn cause our revenues and profitability to suffer similarly demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns regarding the health effects of ingredients such as sodium trans fats sugar processed wheat or other product ingredients or attributes 

we may be unable to grow our market share or add products that are in faster growing and more profitable categories 

the food industry’s growth potential is constrained by population growth our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business faster than populations are growing in the markets that we serve one way to achieve that growth is to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new products in faster growing and more profitable categories our future results will also depend on our ability to increase market share in our existing product categories if we do not succeed in developing innovative products for new and existing categories our growth may slow which could adversely affect our profitability 

customer demand for our products may be limited in future periods as a result of increased purchases in response to promotional activity 

our unit volume in the last week of each quarter can be higher than the average for the preceding weeks of the quarter in certain circumstances in comparison to the average daily shipments in the first 12 weeks of a quarter the final week of each quarter may have as much as four days’ worth of incremental shipments based on a fiveday week reflecting increased promotional activity at the end of the quarter this increased activity includes promotions to assure that our customers have sufficient inventory on hand to support major marketing events or increased seasonal demand early in the next quarter as well as promotions intended to help achieve interim unit volume targets if due to quarterend promotions or other reasons our customers purchase more product in any reporting period than endconsumer demand will require in future periods our sales level in future reporting periods could be adversely affected 

economic downturns could limit consumer demand for our products 

the willingness of consumers to purchase our products depends in part on local economic conditions in periods of economic uncertainty consumers may purchase more generic private label and other economy brands and may forego certain purchases altogether in those circumstances we could experience a reduction in sales of higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings in addition as a result of economic conditions or competitive actions we may be unable to raise our prices sufficiently to protect margins consumers may also reduce the amount of food that they consume away from home at customers that purchase products from our bakeries and foodservice segment any of these events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

our international operations are subject to political and economic risks 

in fiscal 2010 18 percent of our consolidated net sales were generated outside of the united states we are accordingly subject to a number of risks relating to doing business internationally any of which could significantly harm our business these risks include 

 

 

our financial performance on a us dollar denominated basis is subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates these fluctuations could cause material variations in our results of operations our principal exposures are to the australian dollar british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese renminbi euro japanese yen and mexican peso from time to time we enter into agreements that are intended to reduce the effects of our exposure to currency fluctuations but these agreements may not be effective in significantly reducing our exposure 

new regulations or regulatorybased claims could adversely affect our business 

food production and marketing are highly regulated by a variety of federal state local and foreign agencies changes in laws or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements on us including regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could increase our cost of doing business or restrict our actions causing our results of operations to be adversely affected in addition we advertise our products and could be the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal state and foreign laws and regulations and of new laws or regulations restricting our right to advertise products including advertising to children 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could limit financing and other options and in some cases adversely affect our ability to pay dividends 

as of may 30 2010 we had total debt and noncontrolling interests of 67 billion the agreements under which we have issued indebtedness do not prevent us from incurring additional unsecured indebtedness in the future our level of indebtedness may limit our 

• ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures or general corporate purposes particularly if the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward and 

• flexibility to adjust to changing business and market conditions and may make us more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions 

there are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments and noncontrolling interests if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the related indebtedness and other unrelated indebtedness could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity and our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing may also be adversely affected 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt and other obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control 

global capital and credit market issues could negatively affect our liquidity increase our costs of borrowing and disrupt the operations of our suppliers and customers 

the global capital and credit markets including commercial paper markets have experienced increased volatility and disruption making it more difficult for companies to access those markets we depend on stable liquid and wellfunctioning capital and credit markets to fund our operations although we believe that our operating cash flows financial assets access to capital and credit markets and revolvingcredit agreements will permit us to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing our business could also be negatively impacted if our suppliers or customers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy 

volatility in the securities markets interest rates and other factors or changes in our employee base could substantially increase our defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefit costs 

we sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the united states canada and various foreign locations including defined benefit pension retiree health and welfare severance directors’ life and other postemployment plans our major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments changes in interest rates mortality rates health care costs early retirement rates investment returns and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plans a significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations 

our business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately 

the efficient operation of our business depends on our information technology systems we rely on our information technology systems to effectively manage our business data communications supply chain order entry and fulfillment and other business processes the failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in transaction errors processing inefficiencies and the loss of sales and customers causing our business and results of operations to suffer in addition our information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control including fire natural disasters systems failures security breaches and viruses any such damage or interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business 

if other potentially responsible parties prps are unable to contribute to remediation costs at certain contaminated sites our costs for remediation could be material 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign environmental and health and safety laws and regulations under certain of these laws namely the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and its state counterparts liability for investigation and remediation of hazardous substance contamination at currently or formerly owned or operated facilities or at thirdparty waste disposal sites is joint and several we currently are involved in active remediation efforts at certain sites where we have been named a prp if other prps at these sites are unable to contribute to remediation costs we could be held responsible for their portion of the remediation costs and those costs could be material we cannot assure that our costs in relation to these environmental matters or compliance with environmental laws in general will not exceed our established liabilities or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

a change in the assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses or a different weightedaverage cost of capital used to value our reporting units or our indefinitelived intangible assets could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth 

goodwill for each of our reporting units is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred we compare the carrying value of the net assets of a reporting unit including goodwill to the fair value of the unit if the fair value of the net assets of the reporting unit is less than the net assets including goodwill impairment has occurred our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our annual longrange planning process we also make estimates of discount rates perpetuity growth assumptions market comparables and other factors while we currently believe that our goodwill is not impaired different assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses could result in significant impairment losses 

we evaluate the useful lives of our intangible assets primarily intangible assets associated with the pillsbury  totino’s  progresso  green giant  old el paso and häagendazs brands to determine if they are finite or indefinitelived reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry known technological advances legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment 

and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 

our indefinitelived intangible assets are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable our estimate of the fair value of the brands is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs including projected revenues from our annual longrange plan assumed royalty rates which could be payable if we did not own the brands and a discount rate 

as of may 30 2010 we had 103 billion of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets while we currently believe that the fair value of each intangible exceeds its carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses or a different weightedaverage cost of capital could result in significant impairment losses and amortization expense 

resolution of uncertain income tax matters and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our results of operations or cash flows from operations 

we are subject to income tax in the various jurisdictions in which we operate increases in statutory income tax rates and other adverse changes in applicable law in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could reduce our aftertax income and have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

our consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate management judgment is involved in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of any uncertain tax positions we are periodically engaged in tax controversies eg examinations administrative appeals and litigation with revenue and tax authorities we establish liabilities in a variety of taxing jurisdictions when despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable we believe that certain positions may be challenged and may need to be revised we adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit and changes in these liabilities affect our effective income tax rate we also record interest on these liabilities at the appropriate statutory interest rate these interest charges are also included in our effective tax rate but are not included in our liabilities for uncertain tax positions disclosed elsewhere in this report adjustments to these liabilities for individual issues have generally not exceeded 1 percent of earnings before income taxes and aftertax earnings from joint ventures annually 

the internal revenue service irs has concluded its field examinations of our fiscal 2002 to 2006 returns with limited exceptions all matters raised in the field examinations have been resolved the irs has challenged the amount of capital loss and depreciation and amortization we reported as a result of our sale of noncontrolling interests in our general mills cereals llc gmc subsidiary the irs has proposed adjustments that effectively eliminate most of the tax benefits associated with this transaction we believe our positions are supported by substantial technical authority and are vigorously defending our positions we are currently in negotiations with the irs appeals division for fiscal 2002 to 2006 our potential liability for this matter is significant we have determined that a portion of this matter should be included as a component of our total liabilities for uncertain tax positions as disclosed in note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report

executive overview 

we are a global consumer foods company we develop distinctive valueadded food products and market them under unique brand names we work continuously to improve our established products and to create new products that meet consumers’ evolving needs and preferences in addition we build the equity of our brands over time with strong consumerdirected marketing and innovative merchandising we believe our brandbuilding strategy is the key to winning and sustaining leading share positions in markets around the globe 

our fundamental business goal is to generate superior returns for our stockholders over the long term we believe that increases in net sales segment operating profit earnings per share eps and return on average total capital are the key measures of financial performance for our businesses see the “nongaap measures” section below for a description of our discussion of total segment operating profit diluted eps excluding certain items affecting comparability and return on average total capital which are not defined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap 

our objectives are to consistently deliver 

 

we believe that this financial performance coupled with an attractive dividend yield should result in longterm value creation for stockholders we also return a substantial amount of cash annually to stockholders through share repurchases 

for the fiscal year ended may 30 2010 our net sales grew 1 percent total segment operating profit grew 8 percent diluted eps grew 18 percent and our return on average total capital improved by 150 basis points diluted eps growth excluding certain items affecting comparability a nongaap measure used for management reporting and incentive compensation purposes was 16 percent see the “nongaap measures” section below for our use of this measure and our discussion of the items affecting comparability net cash provided by operations totaled 22 billion in fiscal 2010 enabling us to increase our annual dividend payments per share by 12 percent from fiscal 2009 and continue returning cash to stockholders through share repurchases which totaled 692 million in fiscal 2010 we also made significant capital investments totaling 650 million in fiscal 2010 these results met or exceeded our longterm targets 

we achieved each of our five key operating objectives for fiscal 2010

our businesses generate strong levels of cash flows we use some of this cash to reinvest in our business and our fiscal 2011 plans call for 700 million of expenditures for capital projects we also prioritize returning cash to stockholders our plan for fiscal 2011 includes significant cash returned to stockholders through share repurchases and dividends our longterm objective is to reduce outstanding shares by a net 2 percent per year we intend to continue repurchasing shares in fiscal 2011 inline with our longterm objective on june 28 2010 our board of directors approved a dividend increase to an annual rate of 112 per share a 17 percent increase from the rate paid in fiscal 2010 our board of directors also approved and we announced an authorization for the repurchase of up to 100000000 shares of our common stock this new authorization terminated and replaced a december 11 2006 repurchase authorization

230 in fiscal 2010 up 16 percent from 199 in fiscal 2009 see the “nongaap measures” section below for our use of this measure and our discussion of the items affecting comparability 

the components of net sales growth are shown in the following table 

components of net sales growth 

 

 

net sales grew 1 point in fiscal 2010 driven by 1 percentage point of growth from net price realization and mix contributions from volume were flat including the loss of 2 points of growth from divested products and a 1 percentage point loss from an additional week in fiscal 2009 foreign exchange did not affect sales growth in fiscal 2010 

cost of sales decreased 535 million in fiscal 2010 to 8923 million this decrease was mainly driven by favorable mix hmm initiatives and lower input costs in fiscal 2010 we recorded a 7 million net increase in cost of sales related to marktomarket valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories as described in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report compared to a net increase of 119 million in fiscal 2009 in fiscal 2010 we recorded a charge of 48 million resulting from a change in the capitalization threshold for certain equipment parts enabled by an upgrade to our parts management system 

gross margin grew 12 percent in fiscal 2010 versus fiscal 2009 gross margin as a percent of net sales increased by 410 basis points from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 these improvements were driven by favorable mix hmm initiatives and lower input costs 

selling general and administrative sga expenses were up 284 million in fiscal 2010 versus fiscal 2009 sga expenses as a percent of net sales in fiscal 2010 increased by 2 percentage points compared to fiscal 2009 the increase in sga expenses was primarily driven by a 24 percent increase in advertising and media expense in fiscal 2010 the venezuelan government devalued the bolivar exchange rate against the us dollar the effect of the devaluation was a 14 million foreign exchange loss also in fiscal 2010 we recorded a 13 million recovery against a corporate investment compared to write downs of 35 million related to various corporate investments in fiscal 2009 in fiscal 2009 we recorded a 41 million gain from a settlement with the insurance carrier covering the loss of our la salteña pasta manufacturing facility in argentina which was destroyed by fire in fiscal 2008 

there were no divestitures in fiscal 2010 in fiscal 2009 we recorded a net divestiture gain of 129 million related to the sale of our pop • secret product line from our us retail segment for 192 million in cash also in fiscal 2009 we recorded a 38 million loss on the sale of a portion of the assets of our frozen unbaked bread dough product line in our bakeries and foodservice segment including the discontinuation of our frozen dinner roll product line in our us retail segment that shared a divested facility in addition we recorded a 6 million loss in fiscal 2009 on the sale of our bread concentrates product line in our bakeries and foodservice segment 

interest net for fiscal 2010 totaled 402 million 19 million higher than fiscal 2009 average interestbearing instruments decreased 10 billion in fiscal 2010 leading to a 58 million decrease in net interest while average interest rates increased 60 basis points generating a 37 million increase in net interest the average interest rate on our total outstanding debt was 63 percent in fiscal 2010 compared to 57 percent in fiscal 2009 in fiscal 2010 we also recorded a loss of 40 million related to the repurchase of certain notes which represented the premium paid the writeoff of the remaining discount and unamortized fees and the settlement of the related swaps 

restructuring impairment and other exit costs totaled 31 million in fiscal 2010 as follows 

 

in fiscal 2010 we decided to exit our kids’ refrigerated yogurt beverage product line at our murfreesboro tennessee plant and our microwave soup product line at our vineland new jersey plant to rationalize capacity for more profitable items our decisions to exit these us retail segment products resulted in a 24 million noncash charge against the related longlived assets no employees were affected by these actions we expect to recognize 2 million of other exit costs related to these actions which we anticipate will be completed by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2011 we also decided to exit our breadcrumb product line at our federalsburg maryland plant in our bakeries and foodservice segment as a result of this decision we concluded that the future cash flows generated by these products were insufficient to recover the net book value of the associated longlived assets accordingly we recorded a noncash charge of 6 million primarily related to the impairment of these longlived assets and in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 we sold our manufacturing facility in federalsburg for 3 million in fiscal 2010 we also recorded a 1 million net gain on the sale of our previously closed contagem brazil bread and pasta plant for cash proceeds of 6 million and recorded 2 million of costs related to previously announced restructuring actions in fiscal 2010 we paid 8 million in cash related to restructuring actions taken in fiscal 2010 and previous years 

our consolidated effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 was 350 percent compared to 371 percent in fiscal 2009 the 21 percentage point decrease primarily reflects an unfavorable court decision last year on an uncertain tax matter which increased fiscal 2009 income tax expense by 53 million in addition fiscal 2009 included 15 million of tax expense related to nondeductible goodwill writeoffs associated with divestitures fiscal 2010 income tax expense included a 35 million increase related to the enactment of federal health care reform the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 this legislation changed the tax treatment of subsidies to companies that provide prescription drug benefits that are at least the equivalent of benefits under medicare part d see the “impact of inflation” section below for additional discussion of this legislation the fiscal 2010 tax rate also included increased benefits from the domestic manufacturing deduction

average diluted shares outstanding decreased by 4 million in fiscal 2010 from fiscal 2009 due primarily to the timing of share repurchases including the repurchase of 21 million shares since the end of fiscal 2009 partially offset by the issuance of shares upon stock option exercises

impact of inflation 

we have experienced significant input cost volatility since fiscal 2006 our gross margin performance in fiscal 2010 reflects the impact of modest input cost deflation primarily on commodities inputs following three consecutive years of significant input cost inflation we expect the cost of commodities and energy to increase in fiscal 2011 we attempt to minimize the effects of inflation through planning and operating practices our risk management practices are discussed in item 7a of this report 

the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 collectively the act was signed into law in march 2010 the act codifies health care reforms with staggered effective dates from 2010 to 2018 many provisions in the act require the issuance of additional guidance from various government agencies because the act does not take effect fully until future years we do not expect the act to have a material impact on our fiscal 2011 results of operations given the complexity of the act the extended time period over which the reforms will be implemented and the unknown impact of future regulatory guidance the full impact of the act on future periods will not be known until those regulations are adopted 

liquidity

to ensure availability of funds we maintain bank credit lines sufficient to cover our outstanding shortterm borrowings commercial paper is a continuing source of shortterm financing we issue commercial paper in the united states and europe our commercial paper borrowings are supported by 29 billion of feepaid committed credit lines consisting of a 18 billion facility expiring in october 2012 and a 11 billion facility expiring in october 2010 we also have 03 billion in uncommitted credit lines that support our foreign operations as of may 30 2010 there were no amounts outstanding on the feepaid committed credit lines and 76 million was drawn on the uncommitted lines the credit facilities contain several covenants including a requirement to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 25 

certain of our longterm debt agreements our credit facilities and our noncontrolling interests contain restrictive covenants as of may 30 2010 we were in compliance with all of these covenants 

we have 1073 million of longterm debt maturing in the next 12 months that is classified as current we believe that cash flows from operations together with available short and longterm debt financing will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for at least the next 12 months 

as of may 30 2010 our total debt including the impact of derivative instruments designated as hedges was 75 percent in fixedrate and 25 percent in floatingrate instruments compared to 88 percent in fixedrate and 12 percent in floatingrate instruments on may 31 2009 the change in the fixedrate and floatingrate percentages was driven 

by the execution of fixedtofloating rate swaps during fiscal 2010 and refinancing of fixedrate debt with commercial paper 

we have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission sec covering the sale of debt securities the shelf registration statement will expire in december 2011 

growth in return on average total capital is one of our key performance measures see the “nongaap measures” section below for our discussion of this measure which is not defined by gaap return on average total capital increased from 123 percent in fiscal 2009 to 138 percent in fiscal 2010 primarily due to increased earnings and improvements in core working capital we also believe that the ratio of fixed charge coverage and the ratio of operating cash flow to debt are important measures of our financial strength our fixed charge coverage ratio in fiscal 2010 was 642 compared to 533 in fiscal 2009 the measure increased from fiscal 2009 as earnings before income taxes and aftertax earnings from joint ventures increased by 262 million and fixed charges decreased by 40 million driven mainly by lower interest expense our operating cash flow to debt ratio increased 81 points to 339 percent in fiscal 2010 driven by an increase in cash flows from operations and a decrease in our yearend debt balance 

currently standard and poor’s sp has ratings of bbb on our longterm debt and a2 on our commercial paper moody’s investors services moody’s has ratings of baa1 for our longterm debt and p2 for our commercial paper fitch ratings rates our longterm debt bbb and our commercial paper f2 these ratings are not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

in april 2002 we contributed assets to our subsidiary gmc in exchange for the contribution of these assets gmc issued its managing membership interest and its limited preferred membership interests to certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries we continue to hold the entire managing membership interest and therefore direct the operations of gmc 

the thirdparty holder of the class a interests in gmc receives quarterly preferred distributions from available net income based on the application of a floating preferred return rate currently equal to the sum of threemonth libor plus 65 basis points the preferred return rate of the class a interests is adjusted every five years through a negotiated agreement between the class a interest holder and gmc or through a remarketing auction the next remarketing is scheduled to occur in june 2012 and thereafter in fiveyear intervals 

the holder of the class a interests may initiate a liquidation of gmc under certain circumstances including without limitation the bankruptcy of gmc or its subsidiaries gmc’s failure to deliver the preferred distributions on the class a interests gmc’s failure to comply with portfolio requirements breaches of certain covenants lowering of our senior debt rating below either baa3 by moody’s or bbb by sp and a failed attempt to remarket the class a interests as a result of gmc’s failure to assist in such remarketing in the event of a liquidation of gmc each member of gmc will receive the amount of its then current capital account balance the managing member may avoid liquidation by exercising its option to purchase the class a interests 

we may exercise our option to purchase the class a interests for consideration equal to the then current capital account value plus any unpaid preferred return and the prescribed makewhole amount if we purchase these interests any change in the unrelated thirdparty investor’s capital account from its original value will be charged directly to retained earnings and will increase or decrease the net earnings used to calculate eps in that period 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

as of may 30 2010 we have issued guarantees and comfort letters of 538 million for the debt and other obligations of consolidated subsidiaries and guarantees and comfort letters of 302 million for the debt and other obligations of nonconsolidated affiliates mainly cpw in addition offbalance sheet arrangements are generally limited to the future payments under noncancelable operating leases which totaled 315 million as of may 30 2010 

as of may 30 2010 we had invested in three variable interest entities vies we have an interest in a contract manufacturer at our former facility in geneva illinois we are the primary beneficiary pb and have consolidated this entity this entity had property and equipment with a carrying value of 19 million and longterm debt of 21 million as of may 30 2010 the liabilities recognized as a result of consolidating this entity do not represent additional claims on our general assets we also have an interest in a contract manufacturer in greece that is a vie although we are the pb we have not consolidated this entity because it is not practical to do so and it is not material to our results of operations financial condition or liquidity as of and for the year ended may 30 2010 this entity had assets of 7 million and liabilities of 1 million as of may 30 2010 we are not the pb of the remaining vie our maximum exposure to loss from the three vies is limited to the 21 million of longterm debt of the contract manufacturer in geneva illinois and our 2 million equity investment in the vie of which we are not the pb we have not provided financial or other support to these vies during the current period nor are there arrangements related to these vies that could require us to provide financial support in the future 

our defined benefit plans in the united states are subject to the requirements of the pension protection act ppa the ppa revised the basis and methodology for determining defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements as well as maximum contributions to and benefits paid from taxqualified plans most of these provisions were applicable to our domestic defined benefit pension plans in fiscal 2010 on a phasedin basis the ppa may ultimately require us to make additional contributions to our domestic plans we did not make a contribution to our principal defined benefit pension plans in fiscal 2010 although not required under the provisions of the ppa we voluntarily contributed 200 million to our principal defined benefit plans in fiscal 2009 we do not expect to make any contributions to our domestic plans in fiscal 2011 actual fiscal 2011 contributions could exceed our current projections and may be influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts or by changes in regulatory requirements additionally our projections concerning timing of the ppa funding requirements are subject to change and may be influenced by factors such as general market conditions affecting trust asset performance interest rates and our future decisions regarding certain elective provisions of the ppa 

the following table summarizes our future estimated cash payments under existing contractual obligations including payments due by period 

 

 

 

significant accounting estimates 

for a complete description of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report our significant accounting estimates are those that have a meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations these estimates include our accounting for promotional expenditures valuation of longlived assets intangible assets stockbased compensation income taxes and defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefits 

promotional expenditures our promotional activities are conducted through our customers and directly or indirectly with end consumers these activities include payments to customers to perform merchandising activities on our behalf such as advertising or instore displays discounts to our list prices to lower retail shelf prices payments to gain distribution of new products coupons contests and other incentives and media and advertising expenditures the media and advertising expenditures are recognized as expense when the advertisement airs the cost of payments to customers and other consumer activities are recognized as the related revenue is recorded which generally precedes the actual cash expenditure the recognition of these costs requires estimation of customer participation and performance levels these estimates are made based on the forecasted customer sales the timing and forecasted costs of promotional activities and other factors differences between estimated expenses and actual costs are normally insignificant and are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period our accrued trade coupon and consumer marketing liabilities were 555 million as of may 30 2010 and 474 million as of may 31 2009 because our total promotional expenditures including amounts classified as a reduction of revenues are significant if our estimates are inaccurate we would have to make adjustments in subsequent periods that could have a material effect on our results of operations 

valuation of longlived assets longlived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the asset group are less than the carrying amount of the asset group asset groups have identifiable cash flows independent of other asset groups measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent appraisals as appropriate 

intangible assets goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred impairment testing is performed for each of our reporting units we compare the carrying value of a reporting unit including goodwill to the fair value of the unit carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we revalue all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit excluding goodwill to determine if the fair value of the net assets is greater than the net assets including goodwill if the fair value of the net assets is less than the net assets including goodwill impairment has occurred our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our annual longrange planning process we also make estimates of discount rates perpetuity growth assumptions market comparables and other factors 

we evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets mainly brands to determine if they are finite or indefinitelived reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry known technological advances legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 

our indefinitelived intangible assets mainly intangible assets primarily associated with the pillsbury  totino’s  progresso  green giant  old el paso  and häagendazs brands are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable we performed our fiscal 2010 assessment of our brand intangibles as of december 1 2009 our estimate of the fair value of the brands was based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs which included projected revenues from our annual longrange plan assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands and a discount rate as of our assessment date there was no impairment of any of our intangibles as their related fair values were substantially in excess of the carrying values 

as of may 30 2010 we had 103 billion of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets while we currently believe that the fair value of each intangible exceeds its carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses or a different weightedaverage cost of capital could result in significant impairment losses and amortization expense 

stockbased compensation the valuation of stock options is a significant accounting estimate which requires us to use judgments and assumptions that are likely to have a material impact on our financial statements annually we make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility employee exercise behavior dividend yield and the forfeiture rate 

we estimate our future stock price volatility using the historical volatility over the expected term of the option excluding time periods of volatility we believe a marketplace participant would exclude in estimating our stock price volatility for the fiscal 2010 grants we have excluded historical volatility for fiscal 2002 and prior primarily because volatility driven by our acquisition of the pillsbury company pillsbury in fiscal 2002 does not reflect what we believe to be expected future volatility we also have considered but did not use implied volatility in our estimate because trading activity in options on our stock especially those with tenors of greater than 6 months is insufficient to provide a reliable measure of expected volatility if all other assumptions are held constant a one percentage point increase in our fiscal 2010 volatility assumption would increase the grantdate fair value of our fiscal 2010 option awards by 7 percent 

our expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination within the valuation model separate groups of employees have similar historical exercise behavior and therefore were aggregated into a single pool for valuation purposes the weightedaverage expected term for all employee groups is presented in the table below an increase in the expected term by 1 year leaving all other assumptions constant would change the grant date fair value by less than 1 percent 

the riskfree interest rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based on the us treasury zerocoupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant 

the estimated fair values of stock options granted and the assumptions used for the blackscholes optionpricing model were as follows 

 

to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our assumptions we are not required to true up grantdate fair valuebased expense to final intrinsic values however these differences can impact the classification of cash tax benefits realized upon exercise of stock options as explained in the following two paragraphs furthermore historical data has a significant bearing on our forwardlooking assumptions significant variances between actual and predicted experience could lead to prospective revisions in our assumptions which could then significantly impact the yearoveryear comparability of stockbased compensation expense 

any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings referred to as a windfall tax benefit is presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows as a financing cash flow the actual impact on future years’ financing cash flow will depend in part on the volume of employee stock option exercises during a particular year and the relationship between the exercisedate market value of the underlying stock and the original grantdate fair value previously determined for financial reporting purposes 

realized windfall tax benefits are credited to additional paidin capital within the consolidated balance sheets realized shortfall tax benefits amounts which are less than that previously recognized in earnings are first offset against the cumulative balance of windfall tax benefits if any and then charged directly to income tax expense potentially resulting in volatility in our consolidated effective income tax rate we calculated a cumulative amount of windfall tax benefits from post1995 fiscal years for the purpose of accounting for future shortfall tax benefits and currently have sufficient cumulative windfall tax benefits to absorb projected arising shortfalls such that we do not currently expect future earnings to be affected by this provision however as employee stock option exercise behavior is not within our control it is possible that materially different reported results could occur if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail 

income taxes 

we apply a morelikelythannot threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions accordingly we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement future changes in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect earnings in the quarter of such change 

annually we file more than 350 income tax returns in approximately 100 global taxing jurisdictions a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position we believe that our liabilities for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome we adjust these liabilities as well as the related interest in light of changing facts and circumstances settlement of any particular position would usually require the use of cash 

the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction our major taxing jurisdictions include the united states federal and state and canada we are no longer subject to united states federal examinations by the irs for fiscal years before 2002 

the irs has concluded its field examination of our 2006 and prior federal tax years which resulted in payments of 18 million in fiscal 2009 and 56 million in fiscal 2008 to cover the additional us income tax liability plus interest related to adjustments during these audit cycles the irs also proposed additional adjustments for the fiscal 2002 to 2006 audit cycles related to the amount of capital loss and depreciation and amortization we reported as a result of our sale of noncontrolling interests in our gmc subsidiary the irs has proposed adjustments that effectively eliminate most of the tax benefits associated with this transaction we believe our positions are supported by substantial technical authority and are vigorously defending our positions we are currently in negotiations with the irs appeals division for fiscal 2002 to 2006 our potential liability for this matter is significant we have determined that a portion of this matter should be included as a tax liability and have accordingly included it in our total liabilities for uncertain tax positions as disclosed in note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report the irs initiated its audit of our fiscal 2007 and 2008 tax years during fiscal 2009 

in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 we recorded an income tax benefit of 31 million as a result of a favorable us district court decision on an uncertain tax matter in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 the us court of appeals for the eighth circuit issued an opinion reversing the district court decision as a result we recorded 53 million including interest of income tax expense related to the reversal of cumulative income tax benefits from this uncertain tax matter recognized in fiscal years 1992 through 2008 we expect to make cash tax and interest payments of approximately 32 million in connection with this matter 

as of may 30 2010 our total liability for uncertain tax positions and the associated accrued interest and penalties was 728 million we expect to pay approximately 425 million of tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions and accrued interest in the next 12 months including a portion of our potential liability for the matter resolved by the irs appeals division and the us court of appeals for the eighth circuit as discussed in the preceding paragraphs while fiscal years 2007 and 2008 are currently under examination by the irs we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of this and other tax audit outcomes 

various tax examinations by united states state taxing authorities could be conducted for any open tax year which vary by jurisdiction but are generally from 3 to 5 years currently several state examinations are in progress the canada revenue agency is conducting an audit of our income tax returns in canada for fiscal years 2003 which is our earliest tax year still open for examination through 2005 we do not anticipate that any united states state tax or canadian tax adjustments will have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 

defined benefit plans 

defined benefit pension plans we have defined benefit pension plans covering most domestic canadian and united kingdom employees benefits for salaried employees are based on length of service and final average compensation benefits for hourly employees include various monthly amounts for each year of credited service our funding policy is consistent with the requirements of applicable laws we made 200 million of voluntary contributions to our principal domestic plans in fiscal 2009 we did not make any contributions in fiscal 2010 and we do not expect to be required to make any contributions in fiscal 2011 our principal domestic retirement plan covering salaried employees has a provision that any excess pension assets would be allocated to active participants if the plan is terminated within five years of a change in control 

other postretirement benefit plans we also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to the majority of our domestic and canadian retirees the salaried health care benefit plan is contributory with retiree contributions based on years of service we make decisions to fund related trusts for certain employees and retirees on an annual basis we did not make voluntary contributions to these plans in fiscal 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act as modified by the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 was enacted in march 2010 the effect of the act including possible modifications to provider plans has not yet been fully evaluated but could affect the future cost of our benefit plans 

postemployment benefit plans under certain circumstances we also provide accruable benefits to former or inactive employees in the united states canada and mexico and members of our board of directors including severance and certain other benefits payable upon death we recognize an obligation for any of these benefits that vest or accumulate with service postemployment benefits that do not vest or accumulate with service such as severance based solely on annual pay rather than years of service are charged to expense when incurred our postemployment benefit plans are unfunded 

we recognize benefits provided during retirement or following employment over the plan participants’ active working life accordingly we make various assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement of our obligations assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our net periodic benefit expense or income and accumulated benefit obligations include the longterm rates of return on plan assets the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our benefit plans and the health care cost trend rates 

expected rate of return on plan assets our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation our historical longterm investment performance our estimate of future longterm returns by asset class using input from our actuaries investment services and investment managers and longterm inflation assumptions we review this assumption annually for each plan however our annual investment performance for one particular year does not by itself significantly influence our evaluation 

the investment objective for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans is to secure the benefit obligations to participants at a reasonable cost to us our goal is to optimize the longterm return on plan assets at a moderate level of risk the defined benefit pension and other postretirement portfolios are broadly diversified across asset classes within asset classes the portfolios are further diversified across investment styles and investment organizations for the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans the longterm investment policy allocations are 30 percent to equities in the united states 20 percent to international equities 10 percent to private equities 30 percent to fixed income and 10 percent to real assets real estate energy and timber the actual allocations to these asset classes may vary tactically around the longterm policy allocations based on relative market valuations 

our historical investment returns compound annual growth rates for our united states defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan assets were a 17 percent gain in the 1 year period ended may 30 2010 and returns of 5 percent 6 percent 9 percent and 10 percent for the 5 10 15 and 20 year periods ended may 30 2010 

our principal defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in the united states have an expected return on plan assets of 96 percent on a weightedaverage basis the expected rate of return for all defined benefit plans was 955 percent for fiscal 2010 955 percent for fiscal 2009 and 956 percent for fiscal 2008 

lowering the expected longterm rate of return on assets by 50 basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense by 23 million for fiscal 2011 a marketrelated valuation basis is used to reduce yeartoyear expense volatility the marketrelated valuation recognizes certain investment gains or losses over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the marketrelated value of assets and the actual return based on the marketrelated value of assets our outside actuaries perform these calculations as part of our determination of annual expense or income 

discount rates our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of the last day of our fiscal year for all of our defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefit plan obligations we also use the same discount rates to determine defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefit plan income and expense for the following fiscal year we work with our actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan participants and using the top quartile of aarated corporate bond yields to develop a forward interest rate curve including a margin to that index based on our credit risk this forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions 

our weightedaverage discount rates were as follows 

weightedaverage discount rates 

 

lowering the discount rates by 50 basis points would increase our net defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefit plan expense for fiscal 2011 by approximately 31 million all obligationrelated experience gains and losses are amortized using a straightline method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants 

health care cost trend rates we review our health care cost trend rates annually our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims experience and information provided by our actuaries this information includes recent plan experience plan design overall industry experience and projections and assumptions used by other similar organizations our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with this review recent experiences and shortterm expectations our initial health care cost trend rate assumption is 90 percent for all retirees rates are graded down annually until the ultimate trend rate of 52 percent is reached in 2019 for all retirees the trend rates are applicable for calculations only if the retirees’ benefits increase as a result of health care inflation the ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually as necessary to approximate the current economic view on the rate of longterm inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium assumed trend rates for health care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans 

a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate would have the following effects 

 

any arising health care claims costrelated experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculation of expected future claims once recognized experience gains and losses are amortized using a straightline method over 15 years resulting in at least the minimum amortization required being recorded 

financial statement impact in fiscal 2010 we recorded net defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefit plan income of 11 million compared to 4 million of income in fiscal 2009 and 19 million of expense in fiscal 2008 as of may 30 2010 we had cumulative unrecognized actuarial net losses of 14 billion on our defined benefit pension plans and 225 million on our postretirement benefit plans mainly as the result of declines in the values of plan assets these unrecognized actuarial net losses will result in decreases in our future pension income and increases in postretirement expense since they currently exceed the corridors defined by gaap 

we use the retirement plans rp 2000 mortality table projected forward to our plans’ measurement dates to calculate the yearend defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefit obligations and annual expense 

actual future net defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefit plan income or expense will depend on investment performance changes in future discount rates changes in health care cost trend rates and other factors related to the populations participating in these plans 

the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 was signed into law in march 2010 the act codifies health care reforms with staggered effective dates from 2010 to 2018 with many provisions in the act requiring the issuance of additional guidance from various government agencies estimates of the future impacts of several of the act’s provisions are incorporated into our postretirement benefit liability including the elimination of lifetime maximums and the imposition of an excise tax on high cost health plans these changes resulted in a 24 million increase in our postretirement benefit liability as of may 30 2010 given the complexity of the act the extended time period over which the reforms will be implemented and the unknown impact of future regulatory guidance further financial impacts to our postretirement benefit liability and related future expense may occur 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in june 2009 the fasb issued new accounting guidance that changes the consolidation model for variable interest entities vies the guidance requires companies to qualitatively assess the determination of the primary beneficiary of a vie based on whether the company 1 has the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the vie’s economic performance and 2 has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2009 which for us is fiscal 2011 we are currently evaluating the impact of the guidance on our results of operations and financial position 

nongaap measures 

we have included in this report measures of financial performance that are not defined by gaap each of the measures is used in reporting to our executive management and as a component of the board of director’s measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes management and the board of directors believe that these measures provide useful information to investors and include these measures in other communications to investors 

for each of these nongaap financial measures we are providing below a reconciliation of the differences between the nongaap measure and the most directly comparable gaap measure an explanation of why our management or the board of directors believes the nongaap measure provides useful information to investors and any additional purposes for which our management or board of directors uses the nongaap measure these nongaap measures should be viewed in addition to and not in lieu of the comparable gaap measure 

total segment operating profit 

management and the board of directors believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is the profitability measure we use to evaluate segment performance a reconciliation of this measure to operating profit the relevant gaap measure is included in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

diluted eps excluding certain items affecting comparability 

management and the board of directors believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is the profitability measure we use to evaluate earnings performance on a comparable yearoveryear basis the adjustments are either items resulting from infrequently occurring events or items that in management’s judgment significantly affect the yearoveryear assessment of operating results 

the reconciliation of diluted eps excluding certain items affecting comparability to diluted eps the relevant gaap measure follows 

 

 

return on average total capital 

management and the board of directors believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is important for assessing the utilization of capital and it eliminates certain items which affect yeartoyear comparability

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend 

we are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates commodity prices and equity prices changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows in the normal course of business we actively manage our exposure to these market risks by entering into various hedging transactions authorized under established policies that place clear controls on these activities the counterparties in these transactions are generally highly rated institutions we establish credit limits for each counterparty our hedging transactions include but are not limited to a variety of derivative financial instruments 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixedrate debt and existing and future issuances of floatingrate debt primary exposures include us treasury rates libor and commercial paper rates in the united states and europe we use interest rate swaps and forwardstarting interest rate swaps to hedge our exposure to interest rate changes to reduce the volatility of our financing costs and to achieve a desired proportion of fixedrate versus floatingrate debt based on current and projected market conditions generally under these swaps we agree with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixedrate and floatingrate interest amounts based on an agreed upon notional principal amount 

as of may 30 2010 we had 38 billion of aggregate notional principal amount outstanding with a net notional amount of 556 million that converts floatingrate notes to fixed rates this includes notional amounts of offsetting swaps that neutralize our exposure to interest rates on other interest rate swaps 

foreign exchange risk 

foreign currency fluctuations affect our net investments in foreign subsidiaries and foreign currency cash flows related to foreigndenominated commercial paper third party purchases intercompany loans and product shipments we are also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the us dollar our principal exposures are to the australian dollar british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese renminbi euro japanese yen and mexican peso we mainly use foreign currency forward contracts to selectively hedge our foreign currency cash flow exposures we also generally swap our foreigndenominated commercial paper borrowings and nonfunctional currency intercompany loans back to us dollars or the functional currency the gains or losses on these derivatives offset the foreign currency revaluation gains or losses recorded in earnings on the associated borrowings we generally do not hedge more than 18 months forward 

we also have many net investments in foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in euros we previously hedged a portion of these net investments by issuing eurodenominated commercial paper and foreign exchange forward contracts as of may 30 2010 we had deferred net foreign currency transaction losses of 96 million in aoci associated with hedging activity 

commodity price risk 

many commodities we use in the production and distribution of our products are exposed to market price risks we utilize derivatives to manage price risk for our principal ingredients and energy costs including grains oats wheat and corn oils principally soybean nonfat dry milk natural gas and diesel fuel our primary objective when entering into these derivative contracts is to achieve certainty with regard to the future price of commodities purchased for use in our supply chain we manage our exposures through a combination of purchase orders longterm contracts with suppliers exchangetraded futures and options and overthecounter options and swaps we offset our exposures based on current and projected market conditions and generally seek to acquire the inputs at as close to our planned cost as possible 

as of may 30 2010 the net notional value of commodity derivatives was 464 million of which 295 million related to agricultural inputs and 169 million related to energy inputs these contracts relate to inputs that generally will be utilized within the next 12 months 

equity instruments 

equity price movements affect our compensation expense as certain investments made by our employees in our deferred compensation plan are revalued we use equity swaps to manage this market risk 

value at risk 

the estimates in the table below are intended to measure the maximum potential fair value we could lose in one day from adverse changes in market interest rates foreign exchange rates commodity prices and equity prices under normal market conditions a monte carlo valueatrisk var methodology was used to quantify the market risk for our exposures the models assumed normal market conditions and used a 95 percent confidence level 

the var calculation used historical interest rates foreign exchange rates and commodity and equity prices from the past year to estimate the potential volatility and correlation of these rates in the future the market data were drawn from the riskmetrics ™ data set the calculations are not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that we expect to incur further since the hedging instrument the derivative inversely correlates with the underlying exposure we would expect that any loss or gain in the fair value of our derivatives would be generally offset by an increase or decrease in the fair value of the underlying exposure the positions included in the calculations were debt investments interest rate swaps foreign exchange forwards commodity swaps futures and options and equity instruments the calculations do not include the underlying foreign exchange and commoditiesrelated positions that are offset by these marketrisksensitive instruments 

the table below presents the estimated maximum potential var arising from a oneday loss in fair value for our interest rate foreign currency commodity and equity marketrisksensitive instruments outstanding as of may 30 2010 and may 31 2009 and the average fair value impact during the year ended may 30 2010

competition 

the consumer foods industry is highly competitive with numerous manufacturers of varying sizes in the united states and throughout the world the food categories in which we participate are very competitive our principal competitors in these categories all have substantial financial marketing and other resources competition in our product categories is based on product innovation product quality price brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing promotional activity and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences our principal strategies for competing in each of our segments include effective customer relationships superior product quality innovative advertising product promotion product innovation an efficient supply chain and price in most product categories we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products but also with generic and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices internationally we compete with both multinational and local manufacturers and each country includes a unique group of competitors 

seasonality 

in general demand for our products is evenly balanced throughout the year however within our us retail segment demand for refrigerated dough frozen baked goods and baking products is stronger in the fourth calendar quarter demand for progresso soup and green giant canned and frozen vegetables is higher during the fall and winter months internationally demand for häagendazs ice cream is higher during the summer months and demand for baking mix and dough products increases during winter months due to the offsetting impact of these demand trends as well as the different seasons in the northern and southern hemispheres our international segment net sales are generally evenly balanced throughout the year

food quality and safety regulation

environmental matters 

as of may 31 2009 we were involved with four active cleanup sites associated with the alleged or threatened release of hazardous substances or wastes located in sauget illinois minneapolis minnesota carter montana and moonachie new jersey these matters involve several different actions including administrative proceedings commenced by regulatory agencies and demand letters by regulatory agencies and private parties 

we recognize that our potential exposure with respect to any of these sites may be joint and several but have concluded that our probable aggregate exposure is not material to our consolidated financial position or cash flows from operations this conclusion is based upon among other things our payments and accruals with respect to each site the number ranking and financial strength of other potentially responsible parties the status of the proceedings including various settlement agreements consent decrees or court orders allocations of volumetric waste contributions and allocations of relative responsibility among potentially responsible parties developed by regulatory agencies and by private parties remediation cost estimates prepared by governmental authorities or private technical consultants and our historical experience in negotiating and settling disputes with respect to similar sites 

our operations are subject to the clean air act clean water act resource conservation and recovery act comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act and all similar state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations applicable to the jurisdictions in which we operate 

based on current facts and circumstances we believe that neither the results of our environmental proceedings nor our compliance in general with environmental laws or regulations will have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position

 item 1a   risk factors tableend 

our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties any of the risks described below could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

the food categories in which we participate are very competitive and if we are not able to compete effectively our results of operations could be adversely affected 

the food categories in which we participate are very competitive our principal competitors in these categories all have substantial financial marketing and other resources in most product categories we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products but also with generic and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices competition in our product categories is based on product innovation product quality price brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing promotional activity and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences if our large competitors were to decrease their pricing or were to increase their promotional spending we could choose to do the same which could adversely affect our margins and profitability if we did not do the same our revenues and market share could be adversely affected our market share and revenue growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing innovative products in response to changing consumer demands or by new product introductions of our competitors if we are unable to build and sustain brand equity by offering recognizably superior product quality we may be unable to maintain premium pricing over generic and private label products 

we may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face of a consolidating retail environment 

the five largest customers in our us retail segment accounted for 54 percent of its net sales for fiscal 2009 the five largest customers in our international segment accounted for 28 percent of its net sales for fiscal 2009 and the five largest customers in our bakeries and foodservice segment accounted for 41 percent of its net sales for fiscal 2009 the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could adversely affect our sales and profits in addition large retail customers may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency lower pricing increased reliance on their own brand name products increased emphasis on generic and other economy brands and increased promotional programs if we are unable to use our scale marketing expertise product innovation knowledge of consumers’ needs and category leadership positions to respond to these demands our profitability or volume growth could be negatively impacted 

price changes for the commodities we depend on for raw materials packaging and energy may adversely affect our profitability 

the principal raw materials that we use are commodities that experience price volatility caused by external conditions such as weather and product scarcity limited sources of supply commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations and changes in governmental agricultural and energy programs commodity price changes may result in unexpected increases in raw material packaging and energy costs if we are unable to increase productivity to offset these increased costs or increase our prices we may experience reduced margins and profitability we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and the risk management procedures that we do use may not always work as we intend

volatility in the market value of derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices will cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings 

we utilize derivatives to manage price risk for some of our principal ingredient and energy costs including grains oats wheat and corn oils principally soybean nonfat dry milk natural gas and diesel fuel changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded in earnings currently resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings these gains and losses are reported in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of earnings and in unallocated corporate items in our segment operating results until we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating profit we also record our grain inventories at fair value we may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments 

if we are not efficient in our production our profitability could suffer as a result of the highly competitive environment in which we operate 

our future success and earnings growth depends in part on our ability to be efficient in the production and manufacture of our products in highly competitive markets gaining additional efficiencies may become more difficult over time our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or by eliminating redundant costs resulting from acquisitions could adversely affect our profitability and weaken our competitive position many productivity initiatives involve complex reorganization of manufacturing facilities and production lines such manufacturing realignment may result in the interruption of production which may negatively impact product volume and margins 

disruption of our supply chain could adversely affect our business 

our ability to make move and sell products is critical to our success damage or disruption to raw material supplies or our manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather natural disaster fire terrorism pandemic strikes import restrictions or other factors could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or to effectively manage such events if they occur particularly when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location could adversely affect our business and results of operations as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain 

concerns with the safety and quality of food products could cause consumers to avoid certain food products or ingredients 

we could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients adverse publicity about these types of concerns whether or not valid may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions 

if our food products become adulterated misbranded or mislabeled we might need to recall those items and may experience product liability claims if consumers are injured 

we may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated misbranded or mislabeled a widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time we could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us a significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity damage to our reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in our food products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands 

we may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and trends which may result in decreased demand for our products 

our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes and eating habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences consumer preferences change from time to time and can be affected by a number of different trends our failure to anticipate identify or react to these changes and trends or to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis could result in reduced demand for our products which would in turn cause our revenues and profitability to suffer similarly demand for our products could be affected by consumer 

concerns regarding the health effects of ingredients such as trans fats sugar processed wheat or other product ingredients or attributes 

we may be unable to grow our market share or add products that are in faster growing and more profitable categories 

the food industry’s growth potential is constrained by population growth our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business faster than populations are growing in the markets that we serve one way to achieve that growth is to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new products in faster growing and more profitable categories our future results will also depend on our ability to increase market share in our existing product categories if we do not succeed in developing innovative products for new and existing categories our growth may slow which could adversely affect our profitability 

customer demand for our products may be limited in future periods as a result of increased purchases in response to promotional activity 

our unit volume in the last week of each quarter can be higher than the average for the preceding weeks of the quarter in certain circumstances in comparison to the average daily shipments in the first 12 weeks of a quarter the final week of each quarter may have as much as four days’ worth of incremental shipments based on a fiveday week reflecting increased promotional activity at the end of the quarter this increased activity includes promotions to assure that our customers have sufficient inventory on hand to support major marketing events or increased seasonal demand early in the next quarter as well as promotions intended to help achieve interim unit volume targets if due to quarterend promotions or other reasons our customers purchase more product in any reporting period than endconsumer demand will require in future periods our sales level in future reporting periods could be adversely affected 

economic downturns could limit consumer demand for our products 

the willingness of consumers to purchase our products depends in part on local economic conditions in periods of economic uncertainty consumers may purchase more generic private label and other economy brands and may forego certain purchases altogether in those circumstances we could experience a reduction in sales of higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings in addition as a result of economic conditions or competitive actions we may be unable to raise our prices sufficiently to protect margins consumers may also reduce the amount of food that they consume away from home at customers that purchase products from our bakeries and foodservice segment any of these events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations

our international operations are subject to political and economic risks 

in fiscal 2009 18 percent of our consolidated net sales were generated outside of the united states we are accordingly subject to a number of risks relating to doing business internationally any of which could significantly harm our business these risks include

 

 

 

 

our financial performance on a us dollar denominated basis is subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates these fluctuations could cause material variations in our results of operations our principal exposures are to the australian dollar british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese renminbi euro japanese yen and mexican peso from time to time we enter into agreements that are intended to reduce the effects of our exposure to currency fluctuations but these agreements may not be effective in significantly reducing our exposure

new regulations or regulatorybased claims could adversely affect our business 

food production and marketing are highly regulated by a variety of federal state local and foreign agencies changes in laws or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements on us could increase our cost of doing business or restrict our actions causing our results of operations to be adversely affected in addition we advertise our products and could be the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal state and foreign laws and regulations and of new laws or regulations restricting our right to advertise products 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could limit financing and other options and in some cases adversely affect our ability to pay dividends 

as of may 31 2009 we had total debt and minority interests of 73 billion the agreements under which we have issued indebtedness do not prevent us from incurring additional unsecured indebtedness in the future our level of indebtedness may limit our 

• ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures or general corporate purposes particularly if the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward and 

• flexibility to adjust to changing business and market conditions and may make us more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions 

there are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments and minority interests if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the related indebtedness and other unrelated indebtedness could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity and our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing may also be adversely affected 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt and other obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control 

global capital and credit market issues could negatively affect our liquidity increase our costs of borrowing and disrupt the operations of our suppliers and customers 

the global capital and credit markets including commercial paper markets have recently experienced increased volatility and disruption making it more difficult for companies to access those markets we depend on stable liquid and wellfunctioning capital and credit markets to fund our operations although we believe that our operating cash flows financial assets access to capital and credit markets and revolvingcredit agreements will permit us to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing our business could also be negatively impacted if our suppliers or customers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy 

volatility in the securities markets interest rates and other factors or changes in our employee base could substantially increase our defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefit costs 

we sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the united states canada and various foreign locations including defined benefit pension retiree health and welfare severance directors’ life and other postemployment plans our major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments changes in interest rates mortality rates health care costs early retirement rates investment returns and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plans a significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations 

our business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately 

the efficient operation of our business depends on our information technology systems we rely on our information technology systems to effectively manage our business data communications supply chain order entry and fulfillment and other business processes the failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in transaction errors processing inefficiencies and the loss of sales and customers causing our business and results of operations to suffer in addition our information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control including fire natural disasters systems failures security breaches and viruses any such damage or interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business 

if other potentially responsible parties prps are unable to contribute to remediation costs at certain contaminated sites our costs for remediation could be material 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign environmental and health and safety laws and regulations under certain of these laws namely the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and its state counterparts liability for investigation and remediation of hazardous substance contamination at currently or formerly owned or operated facilities or at thirdparty waste disposal sites is joint and several we currently are involved in active remediation efforts at certain sites where we have been named a prp if other prps at these sites are unable to contribute to remediation costs we could be held responsible for their portion of the remediation costs and those costs could be material we cannot assure that our costs in relation to these environmental matters or compliance with environmental laws in general will not exceed our established liabilities or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

a change in the assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses or a different weightedaverage cost of capital used to value our reporting units or our indefinitelived intangible assets could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth 

goodwill for each of our reporting units is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred we compare the carrying value of the net assets of a reporting unit including goodwill to the fair value of the unit if the fair value of the net assets of the reporting unit is less than the net assets including goodwill impairment has occurred our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our annual longrange planning process we also make estimates of discount rates perpetuity growth assumptions market comparables and other factors while we currently believe that our goodwill is not impaired different assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses could result in significant impairment losses 

we evaluate the useful lives of our intangible assets primarily intangible assets associated with the pillsbury  totino’s  progresso  green giant  old el paso  and häagendazs brands to determine if they are finite or indefinitelived reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry known technological advances legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 

our indefinitelived intangible assets are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable our estimate of the fair value of the brands is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs including projected revenues from our annual longrange plan assumed royalty rates which could be payable if we did not own the brands and a discount rate 

as of may 31 2009 we had 104 billion of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets while we currently believe that the fair value of each intangible exceeds its carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses or a different weightedaverage cost of capital could result in significant impairment losses and amortization expense 

resolution of uncertain income tax matters and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our results of operations or cash flows from operations 

we are subject to income tax in the various jurisdictions in which we operate increases in statutory income tax rates in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could reduce our aftertax income and have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

our consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate management judgment is involved in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of any uncertain tax positions we are periodically under examination or engaged in a tax controversy we establish liabilities in a variety of taxing jurisdictions when despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable we believe that certain positions may be challenged and may need to be revised we adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit and changes in these liabilities affect our effective income tax rate we also record interest on these liabilities at the appropriate statutory interest rate these interest charges are also included in our effective tax rate but are not included in our liabilities for uncertain tax positions disclosed elsewhere in this report adjustments to these liabilities for individual issues have generally not exceeded 1 percent of earnings before income taxes and aftertax earnings from joint ventures annually 

the internal revenue service irs has concluded its field examinations of our 20022006 federal tax years with limited exceptions all matters raised in the field examinations have been resolved the irs has challenged the amount of capital loss and depreciation and amortization we reported as a result of our sale of minority interests in our general mills cereals llc gmc subsidiary the irs has proposed adjustments that effectively eliminate most of the tax benefits associated with this transaction we believe we have meritorious defenses and are vigorously defending our positions we have appealed the results of the irs field examination to the irs appeals division our potential liability for this matter is significant we have determined that a portion of this matter should be included as a component of our total liabilities for uncertain tax positions as disclosed in note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report

our fundamental business goal is to generate superior returns for our stockholders over the long term we believe that increases in net sales segment operating profits earnings per share eps and return on average total capital are the key measures of financial performance for our businesses see the “nongaap measures” section below for our discussion of segment operating profit and return on average total capital which are not defined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap our objectives are to consistently deliver

 

we believe that this financial performance coupled with an attractive dividend yield should result in longterm value creation for stockholders we also return a substantial amount of cash annually to stockholders through share repurchases

we achieved each of our five key operating objectives for fiscal 2009

• our cost savings initiatives helped to partially offset input cost inflation in fiscal 2009 we took steps to manage raw material costs especially with significant commodity cost increases in fiscal 2009 we maintained our efforts on holistic margin management hmm which include costsavings initiatives marketing spending efficiencies and profitable sales mix strategies in order to protect our margins enabling us to reinvest in our brands through higher levels of consumer marketing spending

details of our financial results are provided in the “fiscal 2009 consolidated results of operations” section below 

in fiscal 2010 our plans assume that world economic conditions will remain challenging and that foreign currency exchange transaction and translation effects will reduce our reported net sales and earnings growth rates fiscal 2010 will be 52 weeks compared to 53 weeks in fiscal 2009 we expect our net sales in fiscal 2010 to be comparable to fiscal 2009 as reported we expect input cost inflation to moderate from fiscal 2009 levels which together with savings from our hmm initiatives should lead to expanded margins our key operating objectives for fiscal 2010 also include a high single digit increase in consumer marketing support we believe this support coupled with product innovation and consumer spending investments made in fiscal 2009 will be a key factor in generating unit volume growth as we believe it builds consumer loyalty increases our market share and defends against other branded privatelabel and value offerings our plans for international include unit volume growth through investment in our brands in growing categories and growth opportunities through distribution gains and innovation we will also focus on highermargin branded product lines within the most attractive foodservice customer channels

selling general and administrative sga expenses increased by 329 million in fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008 the increase in sga expenses from fiscal 2008 was largely the result of a 17 percent increase in media and other consumer marketing spending consistent with our brandbuilding strategy along with higher levels of compensation and benefits expense we also recorded write downs of 35 million related to various corporate investments in fiscal 2009 compared to a net gain of 16 million in fiscal 2008 these higher costs were partially offset by a 41 million settlement with the insurance carrier covering our la salteña pasta manufacturing plant in argentina that was destroyed by fire sga expenses as a percent of net sales increased by 90 basis points compared to fiscal 2008

our consolidated effective income tax rate for fiscal 2009 was 373 percent compared to 344 percent in fiscal 2008 the increase in the effective rate is primarily due to the effect of a 2009 us appellate court decision that reversed a 2008 us district court decision in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 we recorded an income tax benefit of 31 million as a result of a favorable us district court decision on an uncertain tax matter in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 the us court of appeals for the eighth circuit issued an opinion reversing the district court decision as a result we recorded 53 million including interest of income tax expense related to the reversal of cumulative income tax benefits from this uncertain tax matter recognized in fiscal years 1992 through 2008 we expect to make cash tax and interest payments of approximately 32 million in connection with this matter we are currently evaluating our options for appeal the rate also increased in fiscal 2009 due to 15 million of tax expense related to nondeductible goodwill writeoffs associated with our divestitures

our consolidated effective income tax rate for fiscal 2008 was 344 percent compared to 343 percent for the same period of fiscal 2007 the 01 percentage point increase was the result of an increase in the state income tax rate due to more income in higher rate jurisdictions and lower foreign tax credits these items were offset by a favorable us district court decision on an uncertain tax matter that reduced our liability for uncertain tax positions and related accrued interest by 31 million as discussed above under the heading “fiscal 2009 consolidated results of operations” this decision was reversed by a us appellate court decision in fiscal 2009 

aftertax earnings from joint ventures totaled 111 million in fiscal 2008 compared to 73 million in fiscal 2007 in fiscal 2008 net sales for cpw grew 23 percent driven by higher volume key new product introductions including oats  more in the united kingdom and nesquik duo across a number of regions favorable foreign currency effects and the benefit of a full year of sales from the uncle tobys acquisition which closed in july 2006 our fiscal 2008 aftertax earnings from joint ventures was benefited by 16 million for our share of a gain on the sale of a cpw property in the united kingdom offset by restructuring expenses of 8 million net sales for our häagendazs joint ventures in asia increased 16 percent in fiscal 2008 as a result of favorable foreign exchange and introductory product shipments during the third quarter of fiscal 2008 the 8th continent soymilk business was sold our 50 percent share of the aftertax gain on the sale was 2 million 

average diluted shares outstanding decreased by 13 million from fiscal 2007 due to our repurchase of 24 million shares of stock during fiscal 2008 partially offset by the issuance of 14 million shares to settle a forward purchase contract with an affiliate of lehman brothers the issuance of shares upon stock option exercises the issuance of annual stock awards and the vesting of restricted stock units

selected cash flows from our joint ventures are set forth in the following table 

selected cash flows from joint ventures 

 

impact of inflation 

we have experienced high levels of input cost inflation since fiscal 2006 our gross margin performance in fiscal 2009 reflects the impact of significant input cost inflation primarily from commodities and energy inputs we expect the rate of inflation to moderate in fiscal 2010 we attempt to minimize the effects of inflation through appropriate planning and operating practices our risk management practices are discussed in item 7a of this report 

liquidity 

the primary source of our liquidity is cash flow from operations over the most recent threeyear period our operations have generated 53 billion in cash a substantial portion of this operating cash flow has been returned to stockholders through share repurchases and dividends we also use this source of liquidity to fund our capital expenditures we typically use a combination of cash notes payable and longterm debt to finance acquisitions and major capital expansions 

cash flows from operations 

 

in fiscal 2009 our operations generated 1828 million of cash compared to 1730 million in fiscal 2008 primarily reflecting a 304 million reduction in the use of working capital in fiscal 2009 inventories used 137 million less cash and accounts payable used 242 million more cash year over year due to decreases in grain prices and grain inventory levels in fiscal 2009 other current liabilities were a 136 million increased source of cash primarily due to lower cash taxes paid and higher consumer marketing accruals other current assets provided 96 million more cash primarily due to changes in currency and commodity derivative receivables accounts receivable provided 176 million more cash driven by sales timing shifts and improvements in collections in certain international 

markets the favorable change in working capital was offset by a 200 million voluntary contribution made to our principal domestic pension plans 

we strive to grow a key measure core working capital at or below our growth in net sales for fiscal 2009 core working capital declined 1 percent compared to net sales growth of 8 percent largely driven by a decrease in inventory in fiscal 2009 in fiscal 2008 core working capital grew 12 percent more than net sales growth of 10 percent and in fiscal 2007 core working capital grew 4 percent less than net sales growth of 6 percent 

our cash flows from operations decreased 21 million from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 as a 151 million increase in net earnings and a 72 million effect of changes in deferred income taxes were more than offset by the 276 million increase in the use of cash for working capital 

cash flows from investing activities 

 

in fiscal 2009 cash used by investing activities decreased by 154 million from fiscal 2008 primarily due to proceeds of 245 million from the sale of certain product lines we also received insurance proceeds of 41 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 from the settlement with the insurance carrier covering the loss at our la salteña pasta manufacturing facility in argentina these proceeds will offset the capital expenditures required to replace the manufacturing facility that was destroyed by fire in fiscal 2008 

capital expenditures in fiscal 2009 increased 41 million from the same period last year as we increased manufacturing capacity for our cereal snack bars soup and yogurt products 

in fiscal 2008 cash used by investing activities decreased by 155 million from fiscal 2007 during fiscal 2008 we sold our former production facilities in vallejo california and allentown pennsylvania while in fiscal 2007 we sold our frozen pie product line including a plant in rochester new york and our parbaked bread product line including plants in chelsea massachusetts and tempe arizona these sale proceeds were offset by the funding of our share of cpw’s acquisition of the uncle tobys cereal business in australia reflected in acquisitions and investments in affiliates net and our acquisition of saxby bros limited and our master franchisee of häagendazs shops in greece in addition capital investment for land buildings and equipment increased by 62 million as we continued to increase manufacturing capacity for our snack bars and yogurt products and began consolidating manufacturing for our old el paso product line 

we expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately 630 million in fiscal 2010 including initiatives that will increase manufacturing capacity for yoplait yogurt totino’s pizza rolls pizza snacks  and cereals continue productivity increases throughout the supply chain rebuild the pasta plant in argentina that was destroyed by fire in fiscal 2008 and expand international production capacity for wanchai ferry products and old el paso tortillas

on august 7 2007 we repurchased for a net amount of 843 million all of the outstanding series b1 interests in gmc as part of a required remarketing of those interests the purchase price reflected the series b1 interests’ original capital account balance of 835 million and 8 million of capital account appreciation attributable and paid to the third party holder of the series b1 interests the capital appreciation paid to the third party holder of the series b1 interests was recorded as a reduction to retained earnings a component of stockholders’ equity on our consolidated balance sheets and reduced net earnings available to common stockholders in our basic and diluted eps calculations

capital resources 

total capital consisted of the following 

 

the decline in total capital from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 was primarily due to actuarial losses on our defined benefit plans recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 

the following table details the feepaid committed and uncommitted credit lines we had available as of may 31 2009 

 

to ensure availability of funds we maintain bank credit lines sufficient to cover our outstanding shortterm borrowings commercial paper is a continuing source of shortterm financing we issue commercial paper in the united states canada and europe our commercial paper borrowings are supported by 29 billion of feepaid committed credit lines consisting of a 18 billion facility expiring in october 2012 and a 11 billion facility expiring in october 2010 we also have 04 billion in uncommitted credit lines that support our foreign operations as of may 31 2009 there were no amounts outstanding on the feepaid committed credit lines and 135 million 

was drawn on the uncommitted lines the credit facilities contain several covenants with which we were in compliance as of may 31 2009 including a requirement to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 25 

certain of our longterm debt agreements and our minority interests contain restrictive covenants as of may 31 2009 we were in compliance with all of these covenants 

we have 508 million of longterm debt maturing in the next 12 months that is classified as current we believe that cash flows from operations together with available short and longterm debt financing will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for at least the next 12 months 

as of may 31 2009 our total debt including the impact of derivative instruments designated as hedges was 88 percent in fixedrate and 12 percent in floatingrate instruments compared to 66 percent in fixedrate and 34 percent in floatingrate instruments on may 25 2008 the change in the fixedrate and floatingrate percentages was driven by the refinancing of 19 billion of commercial paper with fixedrate notes during fiscal 2009 

we have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission sec covering the sale of debt securities the shelf registration statement will expire in december 2011 

growth in return on average total capital is one of our key performance measures see the “nongaap measures” section below for our discussion of this measure which is not defined by gaap return on average total capital increased from 118 percent in fiscal 2008 to 123 percent in fiscal 2009 primarily due to increased earnings and improvements in core working capital we also believe important measures of financial strength are the ratio of fixed charge coverage and the ratio of operating cash flow to debt our fixed charge coverage ratio in fiscal 2009 was 531 compared to 487 in fiscal 2008 the measure increased from fiscal 2008 as earnings before income taxes and aftertax earnings from joint ventures increased by 127 million and fixed charges decreased by 31 million our operating cash flow to debt ratio increased 11 points to 258 percent in fiscal 2009 driven by a higher rate of increase in cash flows from operations than the rate of increase in our yearend debt balance 

currently standard and poor’s sp has ratings of bbb on our longterm debt and a2 on our commercial paper moody’s investors services moody’s has ratings of baa1 for our longterm debt and p2 for our commercial paper fitch ratings fitch rates our longterm debt bbb and our commercial paper f2 these ratings are not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

in april 2002 we contributed assets with an aggregate fair market value of 42 billion to our subsidiary gmc the contributed assets consist primarily of manufacturing assets and intellectual property associated with the production and retail sale of big g cereals progresso soups and old el paso products in the united states in exchange for the contribution of these assets gmc issued its managing membership interest and its limited preferred membership interests to certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries we continue to hold the entire managing membership interest and therefore direct the operations of gmc other than the right to consent to certain actions holders of the limited preferred membership interests do not participate in the management of gmc we currently hold all interests in gmc other than the class a interests 

the holder of the class a interests receives quarterly preferred distributions from available net income based on the application of a floating preferred return rate currently equal to the sum of threemonth libor plus 65 basis points to the holder’s capital account balance established in the most recent marktomarket valuation currently 248 million the fifth amended and restated limited liability company agreement of gmc requires that the preferred return rate of the class a interests be adjusted every five years through a negotiated agreement between the class a interest holder and gmc or through a remarketing auction the next remarketing is scheduled to occur in june 2012 and thereafter in fiveyear intervals upon a failed remarketing the preferred return rate over threemonth libor will be increased by 75 basis points until the next remarketing which will occur in 3 month intervals until a successful remarketing occurs or the managing member purchases the class a interests the managing member may at any time elect to purchase all of the class a interests for an amount equal to the holder’s capital account balance as adjusted in a marktomarket valuation plus any accrued but unpaid preferred returns and the prescribed makewhole amount 

holders of the class a interests may initiate a liquidation of gmc under certain circumstances including without limitation the bankruptcy of gmc or its subsidiaries gmc’s failure to deliver the preferred distributions on the class a interests gmc’s failure to comply with portfolio requirements breaches of certain covenants lowering of our senior debt rating below either baa3 by moody’s or bbb by sp and a failed attempt to remarket the class a interests as a result of gmc’s failure to assist in such remarketing in the event of a liquidation of gmc each member of gmc will receive the amount of its then current capital account balance the managing member may avoid liquidation by exercising its option to purchase the class a interests 

for financial reporting purposes the assets liabilities results of operations and cash flows of gmc are included in our consolidated financial statements the return to the third party investor is reflected in net interest in the consolidated statements of earnings the third party investor’s interests in gmc are classified as minority interests on our consolidated balance sheets as discussed in the “recently issued accounting pronouncements” section below we expect our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements — an amendment to arb no 51” sfas 160 in fiscal 2010 to change the financial statement presentation of these interests in gmc 

as discussed above we may exercise our option to purchase the class a interests for consideration equal to the then current capital account value plus any unpaid preferred return and the prescribed makewhole amount if we purchase these interests any change in the unrelated third party investor’s capital account from its original value will be charged directly to retained earnings and will increase or decrease the net earnings used to calculate eps in that period 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

as of may 31 2009 we have issued guarantees and comfort letters of 654 million for the debt and other obligations of consolidated subsidiaries and guarantees and comfort letters of 282 million for the debt and other obligations of nonconsolidated affiliates mainly cpw in addition offbalance sheet arrangements are generally limited to the future payments under noncancelable operating leases which totaled 351 million as of may 31 2009 

as of may 31 2009 we had invested in three variable interest entities vies we have an interest in a contract manufacturer at our former facility in geneva illinois we are the primary beneficiary pb and have consolidated this entity this entity had property and equipment with a carrying value of 25 million and longterm debt of 26 million as of may 31 2009 the liabilities recognized as a result of consolidating this entity do not represent additional claims on our general assets we also have an interest in a contract manufacturer in greece that is a vie although we are the pb we have not consolidated this entity because it is not practical to do so and it is not material to our results of operations financial condition or liquidity as of and for the year ended may 31 2009 this entity had assets of 5 million and liabilities of 1 million as of may 31 2009 we are not the pb of the remaining vie our maximum exposure to loss from the three vies is limited to the 26 million of longterm debt of the contract manufacturer in geneva illinois and our 2 million equity investment in the vie of which we are not the pb we have not provided financial or other support to these vies during the current period nor are there arrangements related to these vies that could require us to provide financial support in the future 

our defined benefit plans in the united states are subject to the requirements of pension protection act ppa the ppa revised the basis and methodology for determining defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements as well as maximum contributions to and benefits paid from taxqualified plans most of these provisions were applicable to our domestic defined benefit pension plans in fiscal 2009 on a phasedin basis although not required under the provisions of the ppa we voluntarily contributed 200 million to our principal defined benefit plans in fiscal 2009 we do not expect to make any contributions to our domestic plans in fiscal 2010 actual fiscal 2010 contributions could exceed our current projections and may be influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts or by changes in regulatory requirements additionally our projections concerning timing of the ppa funding requirements are subject to change and may be influenced by factors such as general market conditions affecting trust asset performance interest rates and our future decisions regarding certain elective provisions of the ppa 

the following table summarizes our future estimated cash payments under existing contractual obligations including payments due by period 

 

 

significant accounting estimates 

for a complete description of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report our significant accounting estimates are those that have a meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations these estimates include our accounting for promotional expenditures valuation of longlived assets intangible assets stockbased compensation income taxes and defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefits 

promotional expenditures 

our promotional activities are conducted through our customers and directly or indirectly with end consumers these activities include payments to customers to perform merchandising activities on our behalf such as advertising or instore displays discounts to our list prices to lower retail shelf prices payments to gain distribution 

of new products coupons contests and other incentives and media and advertising expenditures the media and advertising expenditures are recognized as expense when the advertisement airs the cost of payments to customers and other consumer activities are recognized as the related revenue is recorded which generally precedes the actual cash expenditure the recognition of these costs requires estimation of customer participation and performance levels these estimates are made based on the forecasted customer sales the timing and forecasted costs of promotional activities and other factors differences between estimated expenses and actual costs are normally insignificant and are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period our accrued trade coupon and consumer marketing liabilities were 474 million as of may 31 2009 and 446 million as of may 25 2008 because our total promotional expenditures including amounts classified as a reduction of revenues are significant if our estimates are inaccurate we would have to make adjustments in subsequent periods that could have a material effect on our results of operations 

valuation of longlived assets 

longlived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the asset group are less than the carrying amount of the asset group asset groups have identifiable cash flows independent of other asset groups measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent appraisals as appropriate 

intangible assets 

goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred impairment testing is performed for each of our reporting units we compare the carrying value of a reporting unit including goodwill to the fair value of the unit carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we revalue all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit excluding goodwill to determine if the fair value of the net assets is greater than the net assets including goodwill if the fair value of the net assets is less than the net assets including goodwill impairment has occurred our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our annual longrange planning process we also make estimates of discount rates perpetuity growth assumptions market comparables and other factors 

we evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets mainly intangible assets associated with the pillsbury totino’s progresso green giant  old el paso and häagendazs brands to determine if they are finite or indefinitelived reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry known technological advances legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 

our indefinitelived intangible assets mainly brands are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable we performed our fiscal 2009 assessment of our brand intangibles as of december 1 2008 our estimate of the fair value of the brands was based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs which included projected revenues from our annual longrange plan assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands and a discount rate as of our assessment date there was no impairment of these intangibles and the fair value of the pillsbury brand was more than 10 percent greater than its carrying value up from an excess of 3 percent as of the fiscal 2008 assessment 

as of may 31 2009 we had 104 billion of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets while we currently believe that the fair value of each intangible exceeds its carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses or a different weightedaverage cost of capital could result in significant impairment losses and amortization expense 

stockbased compensation 

the valuation of stock options is a significant accounting estimate which requires us to use judgments and assumptions that are likely to have a material impact on our financial statements annually we make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility employee exercise behavior and dividend yield 

we estimate our future stock price volatility using the historical volatility over the expected term of the option excluding time periods of volatility we believe a marketplace participant would exclude in estimating our stock price volatility for the fiscal 2009 grants we have excluded historical volatility for fiscal 2002 and prior primarily because volatility driven by our acquisition of the pillsbury company pillsbury in fiscal 2002 does not reflect what we believe to be expected future volatility we also have considered but did not use implied volatility in our estimate because trading activity in options on our stock especially those with tenors of greater than 6 months is insufficient to provide a reliable measure of expected volatility if all other assumptions are held constant a one percentage point increase in our fiscal 2009 volatility assumption would increase the grantdate fair value of our fiscal 2009 option awards by 5 percent 

our expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination within the valuation model separate groups of employees have similar historical exercise behavior and therefore were aggregated into a single pool for valuation purposes the weightedaverage expected term for all employee groups is presented in the table below an increase in the expected term by 1 year leaving all other assumptions constant would change the grant date fair value by less than 1 percent 

our valuation model assumes that dividends and our share price increase in line with earnings resulting in a constant dividend yield the riskfree interest rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based on the us treasury zerocoupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant 

the estimated weightedaverage fair values of stock options granted and the assumptions used for the blackscholes optionpricing model were as follows 

 

to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our assumptions we are not required to true up grantdate fair valuebased expense to final intrinsic values however these differences can impact the classification of cash tax benefits realized upon exercise of stock options as explained in the following two paragraphs furthermore historical data has a significant bearing on our forwardlooking assumptions significant variances between actual and predicted experience could lead to prospective revisions in our assumptions which could then significantly impact the yearoveryear comparability of stockbased compensation expense 

any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings referred to as a “windfall tax benefit” is presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows as a financing cash flow the actual impact on future years’ financing cash flow will depend in part on the volume of employee stock option exercises during a particular year and the relationship between the exercisedate market value of the underlying stock and the original grantdate fair value previously determined for financial reporting purposes 

realized windfall tax benefits are credited to additional paidin capital within the consolidated balance sheet realized shortfall tax benefits amounts which are less than that previously recognized in earnings are first offset

against the cumulative balance of windfall tax benefits if any and then charged directly to income tax expense potentially resulting in volatility in our consolidated effective income tax rate we calculated a cumulative amount of windfall tax benefits from post1995 fiscal years for the purpose of accounting for future shortfall tax benefits and currently have sufficient cumulative windfall tax benefits to absorb projected arising shortfalls such that we do not currently expect future earnings to be affected by this provision however as employee stock option exercise behavior is not within our control it is possible that materially different reported results could occur if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail

income taxes 

we apply a morelikelythannot threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions accordingly we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement future changes in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect earnings in the quarter of such change prior to fiscal 2008 our policy was to establish liabilities that reflected the probable outcome of known tax contingencies the effects of final resolution if any were recognized as changes to the effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 

annually we file more than 350 income tax returns in approximately 100 global taxing jurisdictions a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position we believe that our liabilities for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome we adjust these liabilities as well as the related interest in light of changing facts and circumstances settlement of any particular position would usually require the use of cash

the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction our major taxing jurisdictions include the united states federal and state and canada we are no longer subject to united states federal examinations by the irs for fiscal years before 2002 

the irs has concluded its field examination of our 2006 and prior federal tax years which resulted in payments of 18 million in fiscal 2009 and 56 million in fiscal 2008 to cover the additional us income tax liability plus interest related to adjustments during these audit cycles the irs also proposed additional adjustments for the fiscal 2002 to 2006 audit cycles related to the amount of capital loss and depreciation and amortization we reported as a result of our sale of minority interests in our gmc subsidiary the irs has proposed adjustments that effectively eliminate most of the tax benefits associated with this transaction we believe we have meritorious defenses and are vigorously defending our positions we have appealed the results of the irs field examinations to the irs appeals division our potential liability for this matter is significant we have determined that a portion of this matter should be included as a tax liability and is accordingly included in our total liabilities for uncertain tax positions as disclosed in note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report the irs initiated its audit of our fiscal 2007 and 2008 tax years during fiscal 2009 

in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 we recorded an income tax benefit of 31 million as a result of a favorable us district court decision on an uncertain tax matter in the third quarter of 2009 the us court of appeals for the eighth circuit issued an opinion reversing the district court decision as a result we recorded 53 million including interest of income tax expense related to the reversal of cumulative income tax benefits from this uncertain tax matter recognized in fiscal years 1992 through 2008 we are currently evaluating our options for appeal if the appellate court decision is not overturned we would expect to make cash tax and interest payments of approximately 32 million in connection with this matter 

as of may 31 2009 our total liability for uncertain tax positions and the associated accrued interest and penalties was 720 million as of the end of our fiscal year we expect to pay approximately 157 million of tax liabilities and accrued interest in the next 12 months including a portion of our potential liability for the matter resolved by the us court of appeals discussed in the preceding paragraph while fiscal years 2007 and 2008 are currently under examination by the irs we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of this and other tax audit outcomes

various tax examinations by united states state taxing authorities could be conducted for any open tax year which vary by jurisdiction but are generally from 3 to 5 years currently several state examinations are in progress the canada revenue agency is conducting an audit of our income tax returns in canada for fiscal years 2003 which is

our earliest tax year still open for examination through 2005 we do not anticipate that any united states state tax or canadian tax adjustments will have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations

defined benefit plans 

defined benefit pension plans 

we have defined benefit pension plans covering most domestic canadian and united kingdom employees benefits for salaried employees are based on length of service and final average compensation benefits for hourly employees include various monthly amounts for each year of credited service our funding policy is consistent with the requirements of applicable laws we made 200 million of voluntary contributions to our principal domestic plans in fiscal 2009 and are not required to make similar contributions in fiscal 2010 our principal domestic retirement plan covering salaried employees has a provision that any excess pension assets would vest if the plan is terminated within five years of a change in control

other postretirement benefit plans 

we also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to the majority of our domestic and canadian retirees the salaried health care benefit plan is contributory with retiree contributions based on years of service we fund related trusts for certain employees and retirees on an annual basis we did not make voluntary contributions to these plans in fiscal 2009

postemployment benefit plans 

under certain circumstances we also provide accruable benefits to former or inactive employees in the united states canada and mexico and members of our board of directors including severance and certain other benefits payable upon death we recognize an obligation for any of these benefits that vest or accumulate with service postemployment benefits that do not vest or accumulate with service such as severance based solely on annual pay rather than years of service are charged to expense when incurred our postemployment benefit plans are unfunded 

we recognize benefits provided during retirement or following employment over the plan participants’ active working life accordingly we make various assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement of our obligations assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our net periodic benefit expense or income and accumulated benefit obligations include the longterm rates of return on plan assets the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our benefit plans and the health care cost trend rates

expected rate of return on plan assets 

our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation our historical longterm investment performance our estimate of future longterm returns by asset class using input from our actuaries investment services and investment managers and longterm inflation assumptions we review this assumption annually for each plan however our annual investment performance for one particular year does not by itself significantly influence our evaluation 

the investment objective for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans is to secure the benefit obligations to participants at a reasonable cost to us our goal is to optimize the longterm return on plan assets at a moderate level of risk the defined benefit pension and other postretirement portfolios are broadly diversified across asset classes within asset classes the portfolios are further diversified across investment styles and investment organizations for the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans the longterm investment policy allocations are 30 percent to equities in the united states 20 percent to international equities 10 percent to private equities 30 percent to fixed income and 10 percent to real assets real estate energy and timber the actual allocations to these asset classes may vary tactically around the longterm policy allocations based on relative market valuations

our historical investment returns compound annual growth rates for our united states defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan assets were a 25 percent loss in the 1 year period ended may 31 2009 and returns of 5 percent 6 percent 9 percent and 9 percent for the 5 10 15 and 20 year periods ended may 31 2009

our principal defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in the united states have an expected return on plan assets of 96 percent during fiscal 2007 we lowered the expected rate of return on one of our other postretirement plans in the united states based on costs associated with insurance contracts owned by that plan on a weightedaverage basis the expected rate of return for all defined benefit plans was 955 percent for fiscal 2009 956 percent for fiscal 2008 and 957 percent for fiscal 2007

lowering the expected longterm rate of return on assets by 50 basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense by 22 million for fiscal 2010 a marketrelated valuation basis is used to reduce yeartoyear expense volatility the marketrelated valuation recognizes certain investment gains or losses over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the marketrelated value of assets and the actual return based on the marketrelated value of assets our outside actuaries perform these calculations as part of our determination of annual expense or income

discount rates 

our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of the last day of our fiscal year for all of our defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefit plan obligations those same discount rates also are used to determine defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefit plan income and expense for the following fiscal year we work with our actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan participants and using the top quartile of aarated corporate bond yields to develop a forward interest rate curve including a margin to that index based on our credit risk this forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions

our weightedaverage discount rates were as follows

weightedaverage discount rates 

 

lowering the discount rates by 50 basis points would increase our net defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefit plan expense for fiscal 2010 by approximately 25 million all obligationrelated experience gains and losses are amortized using a straightline method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants

health care cost trend rates 

we review our health care trend rates annually our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims experience and information provided by our actuaries this information includes recent plan experience plan design overall industry experience and projections and assumptions used by other similar organizations our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with this review recent experiences and shortterm expectations our initial health care cost trend rate assumption is 95 percent for retirees age 65 and over and 90 percent for retirees under age 65 these rates are graded down annually until the ultimate trend rate of 52 percent is reached in 2018 for all retirees the trend rates are applicable for calculations only if the retirees’ benefits increase as a result of health care inflation the ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually as necessary to approximate the current economic view on the rate of longterm inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium assumed trend rates for health care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans

a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate would have the following effects

 

any arising health care claims costrelated experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculation of expected future claims once recognized experience gains and losses are amortized using a straightline method over 15 years resulting in at least the minimum amortization required being recorded

financial statement impact 

in fiscal 2009 we recorded net defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefit plan income of 4 million compared to 19 million of expense in fiscal 2008 and 36 million of expense in fiscal 2007 as of may 31 2009 we had cumulative unrecognized actuarial net losses of 10 billion on our defined benefit pension plans and 130 million on our postretirement benefit plans mainly as the result of declines in the values of plan assets these unrecognized actuarial net losses will result in decreases in our future pension income and increases in postretirement expense since they currently exceed the corridors defined by gaap

we use the retirement plans rp 2000 mortality table projected forward to our plans’ measurement dates for calculating the yearend defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefit obligations and annual expense

actual future net defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefit plan income or expense will depend on investment performance changes in future discount rates changes in health care trend rates and various other factors related to the populations participating in these plans

nongaap measures 

we have included in this report measures of financial performance that are not defined by gaap for each of these nongaap financial measures we are providing below a reconciliation of the differences between the nongaap measure and the most directly comparable gaap measure an explanation of why our management or the board of directors believes the nongaap measure provides useful information to investors and any additional purposes for which our management or board of directors uses the nongaap measure these nongaap measures should be viewed in addition to and not in lieu of the comparable gaap measure

total segment operating profit 

this nongaap measure is used in reporting to our executive management and as a component of the board of directors’ measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes management and the board of directors believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is the profitability measure we use to evaluate segment performance a reconciliation of this measure to operating profit the relevant gaap measure is included in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report

return on average total capital 

this ratio is not defined by gaap and is used in internal management reporting and as a component of the board of directors’ rating of our performance for incentive compensation purposes management and the board of directors believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is important for assessing the utilization of capital and it eliminates the effects of infrequently occurring events thereby improving yeartoyear comparability

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend 

we are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates commodity prices and equity prices changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows in the normal course of business we actively manage our exposure to these market risks by entering into various hedging transactions authorized under established policies that place clear controls on these activities the counterparties in these transactions are generally highly rated institutions we establish credit limits for each counterparty our hedging transactions include but are not limited to a variety of derivative financial instruments

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixedrate debt and existing and future issuances of floatingrate debt primary exposures include us treasury rates libor and commercial paper rates in the united states and europe we use interest rate swaps and forwardstarting interest rate swaps to hedge our exposure to interest rate changes to reduce the volatility of our financing costs and to achieve a desired proportion of fixed versus floatingrate debt based on current and projected market conditions generally under these swaps we agree with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixedrate and floatingrate interest amounts based on an agreed upon notional principal amount

as of may 31 2009 we had 41 billion of aggregate notional principal amount outstanding with a net notional amount of 446 million that converts floatingrate notes to fixed rates this includes notional amounts of offsetting swaps that neutralize our exposure to interest rates on other interest rate swaps

foreign exchange risk 

foreign currency fluctuations affect our net investments in foreign subsidiaries and foreign currency cash flows related to foreigndenominated commercial paper third party purchases intercompany loans and product shipments we are also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the us dollar our principal exposures are to the australian dollar british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese renminbi euro japanese yen and mexican peso we mainly use foreign currency forward contracts to selectively hedge our foreign currency cash flow exposures we also generally swap our foreigndominated commercial paper borrowings back to us dollars the gains or losses on these derivatives offset the foreign currency revaluation gains or losses recorded in earnings on the associated borrowings we generally do not hedge more than 12 months forward

we also have many net investments in foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in euros we previously hedged a portion of these net investments by issuing eurodenominated commercial paper and foreign exchange forward contracts as of may 31 2009 we had deferred net foreign currency transaction losses of 96 million in accumulated other comprehensive income loss associated with this hedging activity

commodity price risk 

many commodities we use in the production and distribution of our products are exposed to market price risks we utilize derivatives to manage price risk for our principal ingredient and energy costs including grains oats wheat and corn oils principally soybean nonfat dry milk natural gas and diesel fuel our primary objective when entering into these derivative contracts is to achieve certainty with regard to the future price of commodities purchased for use in our supply chain we manage our exposures through a combination of purchase orders longterm contracts with suppliers exchangetraded futures and options and overthecounter options and swaps we offset our exposures based on current and projected market conditions and generally seek to acquire the inputs at as close to our planned cost as possible

as of may 31 2009 the net notional value of commodity derivatives was 191 million of which 68 million relates to agricultural positions and 123 million relates to energy positions these derivatives relate to inputs that generally will be utilized within the next 12 months

equity instruments 

equity price movements affect our compensation expense as certain investments owned by our employees related to our deferred compensation plan are revalued we use equity swaps to manage this market risk

value at risk 

the estimates in the table below are intended to measure the maximum potential fair value we could lose in one day from adverse changes in market interest rates foreign exchange rates commodity prices and equity prices under normal market conditions a monte carlo valueatrisk var methodology was used to quantify the market risk for our exposures the models assumed normal market conditions and used a 95 percent confidence level

the var calculation used historical interest rates foreign exchange rates and commodity and equity prices from the past year to estimate the potential volatility and correlation of these rates in the future the market data were drawn from the riskmetrics tm data set the calculations are not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that we expect to incur further since the hedging instrument the derivative inversely correlates with the underlying exposure we would expect that any loss or gain in the fair value of our derivatives would be generally offset by an increase or decrease in the fair value of the underlying exposure the positions included in the calculations were debt investments interest rate swaps foreign exchange forwards commodity swaps futures and options and

equity instruments the calculations do not include the underlying foreign exchange and commoditiesrelated positions that are offset by these marketrisksensitive instruments

the table below presents the estimated maximum potential var arising from a oneday loss in fair value for our interest rate foreign currency commodity and equity marketrisksensitive instruments outstanding as of may 31 2009 and may 25 2008 and the average fair value impact during the year ended may 31 2009

competition 

the consumer foods industry is highly competitive with numerous manufacturers of varying sizes in the united states and throughout the world the food categories in which we participate are very competitive our principal competitors in these categories all have substantial financial marketing and other resources competition in our product categories is based on product innovation product quality price brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing promotional activity and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences our principal strategies for competing in each of our segments include effective customer relationships superior product quality innovative advertising product promotion product innovation an efficient supply chain and price in most product categories we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products but also with generic and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices internationally we compete with both multinational and local manufacturers and each country includes a unique group of competitors 

 

seasonality 

in general demand for our products is evenly balanced throughout the year however within our us retail segment demand for refrigerated dough frozen baked goods and baking products is stronger in the fourth calendar quarter demand for progresso soup and green giant canned and frozen vegetables is higher during the fall and winter months internationally demand for häagendazs ice cream is higher during the summer months and demand for baking mix and dough products increases during winter months due to the offsetting impact of these demand trends as well as the different seasons in the northern and southern hemispheres our international segment net sales are generally evenly balanced throughout the year

food quality and safety regulation

environmental matters 

as of may 25 2008 we were involved with four active cleanup sites associated with the alleged or threatened release of hazardous substances or wastes located in minneapolis minnesota sauget illinois moonachie new jersey and doolittle missouri these matters involve several different actions including administrative proceedings commenced by regulatory agencies and demand letters by regulatory agencies and private parties 

 

we recognize that our potential exposure with respect to any of these sites may be joint and several but have concluded that our probable aggregate exposure is not material to our consolidated financial position or cash flows from operations this conclusion is based upon among other things our payments and accruals with respect to each site the number ranking and financial strength of other potentially responsible parties the status of the proceedings including various settlement agreements consent decrees or court orders allocations of volumetric waste contributions and allocations of relative responsibility among potentially responsible parties developed by regulatory agencies and by private parties remediation cost estimates prepared by governmental authorities or private technical consultants and our historical experience in negotiating and settling disputes with respect to similar sites 

 

our operations are subject to the clean air act clean water act resource conservation and recovery act comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act and all similar state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations applicable to the jurisdictions in which we operate 

 

based on current facts and circumstances we believe that neither the results of our environmental proceedings nor our compliance in general with environmental laws or regulations will have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position

 item 1a risk factors tableend our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties any of the risks described below could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

the food categories in which we participate are very competitive and if we are not able to compete effectively our results of operations could be adversely affected 

 

the food categories in which we participate are very competitive our principal competitors in these categories all have substantial financial marketing and other resources in most product categories we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products but also with generic and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices competition in our product categories is based on product innovation product quality price brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing promotional activity and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences if our large competitors were to decrease their pricing or were to increase their promotional spending we could choose to do the same which could adversely affect our margins and profitability if we did not do the same our revenues and market share could be adversely affected our market share and revenue growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing innovative products in response to changing consumer demands or by new product introductions of our competitors if we are unable to build and sustain brand equity by offering recognizably superior product quality we may be unable to maintain premium pricing over generic and private label products 

 

we may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face of a consolidating retail environment 

 

the 5 largest customers in our us retail segment accounted for 57 percent of its fiscal 2008 net sales the 5 largest customers in our international segment accounted for 26 percent of its net sales for fiscal 2008 and the 5 largest customers in our bakeries and foodservice segment accounted for 39 percent of its net sales for fiscal 2008 the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could adversely affect our sales and profits there has been significant worldwide consolidation in the grocery industry in recent years and we believe that this trend is likely to continue as the retail grocery trade continues to consolidate and mass market retailers become larger our large retail customers may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency lower pricing increased emphasis on generic private label and other economy brands and increased promotional programs if we are unable to use our scale marketing expertise product innovation knowledge of consumers’ needs and category leadership positions to respond to these demands our profitability or volume growth could be negatively impacted 

 

price changes for the commodities we depend on for raw materials packaging and energy may adversely affect our profitability 

 

the principal raw materials that we use are commodities that experience price volatility caused by external conditions such as weather and product scarcity limited sources of supply 

 

commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations and changes in governmental agricultural and energy programs commodity price changes may result in unexpected increases in raw material packaging and energy costs if we are unable to increase productivity to offset these increased costs or increase our prices we may experience reduced margins and profitability we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and the hedging procedures that we do use may not always work as we intend 

 

volatility in the market value of derivatives we use to hedge exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices will cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings 

 

we utilize derivatives to hedge price risk for some of our principal ingredient and energy costs including grains oats wheat and corn oils principally soybean nonfat dry milk natural gas and diesel fuel changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded in earnings currently resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings these gains and losses are reported in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of earnings and in unallocated corporate items in our segment operating results until we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating profit we also record our grain inventories at fair value we may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments 

 

if we are not efficient in our production our profitability could suffer as a result of the highly competitive environment in which we operate 

 

our future success and earnings growth depends in part on our ability to be efficient in the production and manufacture of our products in highly competitive markets gaining additional efficiencies may become more difficult over time our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or by eliminating redundant costs resulting from acquisitions could adversely affect our profitability and weaken our competitive position many productivity initiatives involve complex reorganization of manufacturing facilities and production lines such manufacturing realignment may result in the interruption of production which may negatively impact product volume and margins 

 

disruption of our supply chain could adversely affect our business 

 

our ability to make move and sell products is critical to our success damage or disruption to raw material supplies or our manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather natural disaster fire terrorism pandemic strikes import restrictions or other factors could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or to effectively manage such events if they occur particularly when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location could adversely affect our business and results of operations as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain 

 

concerns with the safety and quality of food products could cause consumers to avoid certain food products or ingredients 

 

we could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients adverse publicity about these types of concerns whether or not valid may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions 

 

if our food products become adulterated misbranded or mislabeled we might need to recall those items and may experience product liability claims if consumers are injured 

 

we may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated misbranded or mislabeled a widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time we could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us a significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity damage to our reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in our food products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands 

 

 

we may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and trends which may result in decreased demand for our products 

 

our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes and eating habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences consumer preferences change from time to time and can be affected by a number of different trends our failure to anticipate identify or react to these changes and trends or to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis could result in reduced demand for our products which would in turn cause our revenues and profitability to suffer similarly demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns regarding the health effects of ingredients such as trans fats sugar processed wheat or other product ingredients or attributes 

 

we may be unable to grow our market share or add products that are in faster growing and more profitable categories 

 

the food industry’s growth potential is constrained by population growth our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business faster than populations are growing in the markets that we serve one way to achieve that growth is to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new products in faster growing and more profitable categories our future results will also depend on our ability to increase market share in our existing product categories if we do not succeed in developing innovative products for new and existing categories our growth may slow which could adversely affect our profitability 

 

customer demand for our products may be limited in future periods as a result of increased purchases in response to promotional activity 

 

our unit volume in the last week of each quarter can be higher than the average for the preceding weeks of the quarter in certain circumstances in comparison to the average daily shipments in the first 12 weeks of a quarter the final week of each quarter may have as much as two to four days’ worth of incremental shipments based on a fiveday week reflecting increased promotional activity at the end of the quarter this increased activity includes promotions to assure that our customers have sufficient inventory on hand to support major marketing events or increased seasonal demand early in the next quarter as well as promotions intended to help achieve interim unit volume targets if due to quarterend promotions or other reasons our customers purchase more product in any reporting period than endconsumer demand will require in future periods our sales level in future reporting periods could be adversely affected 

 

economic downturns could limit consumer demand for our products 

 

the willingness of consumers to purchase our products depends in part on local economic conditions in periods of economic uncertainty consumers may purchase more generic private label and other economy brands and may forego certain purchases altogether in those circumstances we could experience a reduction in sales of higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings in addition as a result of economic conditions or competitive actions we may be unable to raise our prices sufficiently to protect margins consumers may also reduce the amount of food that they consume away from home at customers that purchase products from our bakeries and foodservice segment any of these events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

our international operations are subject to political and economic risks 

 

in fiscal 2008 19 percent of our consolidated net sales was generated outside of the united states we are accordingly subject to a number of risks relating to doing business internationally any of which could significantly harm our business these risks include 

• political and economic instability 

• exchange controls and currency exchange rates 

• foreign tax treaties and policies and 

• restriction on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries 

 

our financial performance on a us dollar denominated basis is subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates these fluctuations could cause material variations in our results of operations our principal exposures are to the australian dollar british pound 

 

sterling canadian dollar chinese renminbi euro japanese yen and mexican peso from time to time we enter into agreements that are intended to reduce the effects of our exposure to currency fluctuations but these agreements may not be effective in significantly reducing our exposure 

 

new regulations or regulatorybased claims could adversely affect our business 

 

food production and marketing are highly regulated by a variety of federal state local and foreign agencies changes in laws or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements on us could increase our cost of doing business or restrict our actions causing our results of operations to be adversely affected in addition we advertise our products and could be the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal state and foreign laws and regulations and of new laws or regulations restricting our right to advertise products 

 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could limit financing and other options and in some cases adversely affect our ability to pay dividends 

 

as of may 25 2008 we had total debt and minority interests of 72 billion the agreements under which we have issued indebtedness do not prevent us from incurring additional unsecured indebtedness in the future our level of indebtedness may limit our 

• ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures or general corporate purposes particularly if the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward and 

• flexibility to adjust to changing business and market conditions and may make us more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions 

 

there are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments and minority interests if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the related indebtedness and other unrelated indebtedness could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity and our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing may also be adversely affected 

 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt and other obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control 

 

volatility in the securities markets interest rates and other factors or changes in our employee base could substantially increase our defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefit costs 

 

we sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the united states canada and various foreign locations including defined benefit pension retiree health and welfare severance directors’ life and other postemployment benefit plans our major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments changes in interest rates mortality rates health care costs early retirement rates investment returns and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefit plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plans although the aggregate fair value of our defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefit plan assets exceeded the aggregate defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefit obligations as of may 25 2008 a significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations 

 

our business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately 

 

the efficient operation of our business depends on our information technology systems we rely on our information technology systems to effectively manage our business data communications supply chain order entry and fulfillment and other business processes the failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in transaction errors processing inefficiencies and the loss of sales and customers causing our business and results of operations to suffer in addition our information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from 

 

circumstances beyond our control including fire natural disasters systems failures security breaches and viruses any such damage or interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

if other potentially responsible parties prps are unable to contribute to remediation costs at certain contaminated sites our costs for remediation could be material 

 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign environmental and health and safety laws and regulations under certain of these laws namely the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and its state counterparts liability for investigation and remediation of hazardous substance contamination at currently or formerly owned or operated facilities or at thirdparty waste disposal sites is joint and several we currently are involved in active remediation efforts at certain sites where we have been named a prp if other prps at these sites are unable to contribute to remediation costs we could be held responsible for their portion of the remediation costs and those costs could be material we cannot assure that our costs in relation to these environmental matters or compliance with environmental laws in general will not exceed our reserves or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

 

a change in the assumptions used to value our reporting units or our indefinitelived intangible assets could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth 

 

goodwill for each of our reporting units is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred we compare the carrying value of the net assets of a reporting unit including goodwill to the fair value of the unit if the fair value of the net assets of the reporting unit is less than the net assets including goodwill impairment has occurred our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our annual longrange planning process we also make estimates of discount rates perpetuity growth assumptions market comparables and other factors while we currently believe that our goodwill is not impaired materially different assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses could result in significant impairment losses 

 

we evaluate the useful lives of our intangible assets primarily intangible assets associated with the pillsbury  totino’s  progresso  green giant  old el paso  häagendazs and uncle tobys brands to determine if they are finite or indefinitelived reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry known technological advances legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 

 

our indefinitelived intangible assets are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable our estimate of the fair value of the brands is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs including projected revenues from our annual longrange plan assumed royalty rates which could be payable if we did not own the brands and a discount rate while we currently believe that the fair value of each indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds its carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows materially different assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses could result in significant impairment losses and amortization expense 

 

resolution of uncertain income tax matters could adversely affect our results of operations or cash flows from operations 

 

our consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate management judgment is involved in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of any uncertain tax positions we are periodically under examination or engaged in a tax controversy we establish reserves in a variety of taxing jurisdictions when despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable we believe that certain positions may be challenged and may need to be 

 

revised we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit our effective income tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to those reserves we also record interest on these reserves at the appropriate statutory interest rate these interest charges are also included in our effective tax rate reserve adjustments for individual issues have generally not exceeded 1 percent of earnings before income taxes and aftertax earnings from joint ventures annually 

 

during fiscal 2008 the internal revenue service irs concluded field examinations for our 2002 and 2003 federal tax years these examinations included review of our determinations of cost basis capital losses and the depreciation of tangible assets and amortization of intangible assets arising from our acquisition of pillsbury and the sale of minority interests in our general mills cereals llc subsidiary the irs has proposed adjustments related to a majority of the tax benefits associated with these items we believe we have meritorious defenses and intend to vigorously defend our positions our potential liability for this matter is significant and notwithstanding our reserves against this potential liability an unfavorable resolution could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or cash flows from operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

executive overview 

we are a global consumer foods company we develop distinctive food products and market these valueadded products under unique brand names we work continuously to improve our established brands and to create new products that meet consumers’ evolving needs and preferences in addition we build the equity of our brands over time with strong consumerdirected marketing and innovative merchandising we believe our brandbuilding strategy is the key to winning and sustaining leading share positions in markets around the globe 

 

our fundamental business goal is to generate superior returns for our stockholders over the long term we believe that increases in net sales segment operating profits earnings per share eps and return on average total capital are the key measures of financial performance for our businesses see the “nongaap measures” section below for our discussion of segment operating profit and return on average total capital which are not defined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap our objectives are to consistently deliver 

 

• low singledigit annual growth in net sales 

• mid singledigit annual growth in total segment operating profit 

• high singledigit annual growth in eps and 

• on average at least a 50 basis point annual increase in return on average total capital 

 

we believe that this financial performance coupled with an attractive dividend yield should result in longterm value creation for stockholders we also return a substantial amount of cash annually to stockholders through share repurchases 

 

for the fiscal year ended may 25 2008 our net sales grew 97 percent total segment operating profit grew 64 percent diluted eps grew 167 percent and our return on average total capital improved by 100 basis points these results met or exceeded our longterm targets diluted eps for fiscal 2008 includes a 010 net gain from marktomarket valuation of certain commodity positions and a 009 benefit associated with a favorable court decision on a discrete tax matter net cash provided by operations totaled 17 billion in fiscal 2008 enabling us to increase our annual dividend payments per share by 90 percent from fiscal 2007 and continue returning cash to stockholders through share repurchases which totaled 13846 million in fiscal 2008 we also made significant capital investments totaling 5220 million in fiscal 2008 an increase of 134 percent from fiscal 2007 to support future growth and productivity 

 

we achieved each of our four key operating objectives for fiscal 2008 

• we generated broadbased growth in net sales across our businesses all of our us retail divisions international geographic regions and bakeries and foodservice customer segments posted net sales gains in fiscal 2008 we generated 29 points of growth from volume generated 53 points of growth from net price realization and product mix and realized 15 points of foreign currency exchange benefit 

• our cost savings initiatives helped to partially offset input cost inflation in fiscal 2008 we took steps to manage raw material costs especially with significant commodity price increases in fiscal 2008 and we initiated several restructuring actions to rationalize and simplify our product portfolio allowing us to focus on higher margin products 

• we invested a significant amount in media and other brandbuilding marketing programs which contributed to sales growth across our businesses 

• we also recorded increases in eps well above our target even excluding the effects of noncash marktomarket gains and a discrete tax item 

 

details of our financial results are provided in the “fiscal 2008 consolidated results of operations” section below 

 

in fiscal 2009 input cost inflation will remain a challenge for us we plan to offset a significant portion of this cost inflation with our holistic margin management hmm efforts which include costsavings initiatives marketing spending efficiencies and profitable sales mix strategies we have also raised prices on a number of our product lines we believe our hmm efforts help us keep our price increases moderate and expand our margins over the long term in addition our hmm savings generate resources for increased advertising and other brandbuilding consumer marketing initiatives our plans call for a high single digit increase in consumer marketing support in fiscal 2009 we believe this support is a key factor in generating net sales growth as we believe it builds consumer loyalty increases our market share and defends against privatelabel offerings 

 

in addition to protecting and expanding our margins over time and investing in brandbuilding marketing initiatives our key operating objectives for fiscal 2009 include plans for introducing new products and extending existing brands to new markets we 

 

are exploring innovative ways to partner with customers including traditional food retailers new retail formats and various awayfromhome channels we will continue to grow our business in international markets focusing on our core platforms of superpremium ice cream world cuisine and healthy snacking 

 

our plans also call for 550 million of expenditures for capital projects and a significant amount of cash returned to stockholders through share repurchases and dividends our longterm objective is to reduce outstanding shares by a net 2 percent per year we intend to continue repurchasing shares in fiscal 2009 with a goal of reducing average diluted shares outstanding a net 1 percent on june 23 2008 our board of directors approved a dividend increase to an annual rate of 172 per share this represents a 9 percent compound annual growth rate in dividends from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2009

the components of net sales growth are shown in the following table 

 

components of net sales growth 

 

 

  

net sales for fiscal 2008 grew 97 percent to 137 billion driven by 29 percentage points from volume growth mainly in our us retail and international segments and 53 percentage points of growth from net price realization and product mix across many of our businesses in addition foreign currency exchange effects added 15 percentage points of growth during the second quarter of fiscal 2008 we voluntarily recalled all pepperoni varieties of totino’s and jeno’s frozen pizza manufactured on or before october 30 2007 due to potential contamination we also voluntarily recalled one flavor of progresso soup during the third quarter of fiscal 2008 the frozen pizza and soup recalls did not significantly impact our net sales for fiscal 2008 

 

cost of sales was up 8232 million in fiscal 2008 versus fiscal 2007 cost of sales as a percent of net sales increased from 639 percent in fiscal 2007 to 643 percent in fiscal 2008 higher volume drove 2069 million of this increase higher input costs and changes in mix increased cost of sales by 6321 million we recorded net marktomarket gains of 596 million related to hedges on open commodity positions that will mitigate future input cost inflation and a 26 million loss from the revaluation of certain grain inventories to market we also recorded 185 million of charges to cost of sales primarily accelerated depreciation on longlived assets associated with previously announced restructuring actions our la salteña pasta manufacturing plant in argentina was destroyed by a fire resulting in a loss of 13 million net of insurance proceeds from the write off of inventory and property plant and equipment and severance expense related to this event cost of sales for fiscal 2008 also includes 214 million of costs including product write offs logistics and other costs related to the voluntary recalls 

 

gross margin grew 86 percent in fiscal 2008 versus fiscal 2007 driven by higher volume cost savings initiatives and net price realization gross margin as a percent of net sales declined 40 basis points from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 this primarily reflects declines in our bakeries and foodservice segment where we took price increases designed to offset cost increases on a dollar basis but gross margin as a percent of net sales declined 

 

selling general and administrative sga expenses increased by 2357 million in fiscal 2008 versus fiscal 2007 the increase in sga expenses from fiscal 2007 was largely the result of a 132 percent increase in media and other consumer marketing spending consistent with our brandbuilding strategy 301 million more foreign exchange losses than a year ago higher levels of compensation and benefits a 71 percent increase in research and development expense supporting our innovation initiatives and 92 million of costs associated with the remarketing of the class a and series b1 interests in our subsidiary general mills cereals llc gmc sga expense as a percent of net sales was essentially flat compared to fiscal 2007

restructuring impairment and other exit costs totaled 210 million in fiscal 2008 as follows 

 

 

 

we approved a plan to transfer old el paso production from our poplar wisconsin facility to other plants and to close the poplar facility to improve capacity utilization and reduce costs this action affects 113 employees at the poplar facility and resulted in a charge of 27 million consisting entirely of employee severance due to declining financial results we decided to exit our frozen waffle product line retail and foodservice and to close our frozen waffle plant in allentown pennsylvania affecting 111 employees we recorded a charge consisting of 35 million of employee severance and a 59 million noncash impairment charge against longlived assets at the plant we also completed an analysis of the viability of our bakeries and foodservice frozen dough facility in trenton ontario and decided to close the facility affecting 470 employees we recorded a charge consisting of 84 million for employee expenses and 25 million in charges for shutdown and decommissioning costs we lease the trenton plant under an agreement expiring in fiscal 2013 we expect to make limited use of the plant during fiscal 2009 while we evaluate sublease or lease termination options these actions including the anticipated timing of the disposition of the plants we will close are expected to be completed by the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2009 we also restructured our production scheduling and discontinued our cake production line at our chanhassen minnesota bakeries and foodservice plant these actions affected 125 employees and we recorded a 30 million charge for employee severance partially offset by a 14 million gain from the sale of longlived assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 this action is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2009 finally we recorded additional charges of 35 million primarily related to previously announced bakeries and foodservice segment restructuring actions including employee severance for 38 employees

our consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate the effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 was 344 percent compared to 343 percent for the same period of fiscal 2007 the 01 percentage point increase is the result of an increase in the state income tax rate due to more income in higher rate jurisdictions and lower foreign tax credits these items were offset by a favorable us federal district court decision on an uncertain tax matter that reduced our liability for uncertain tax positions and related accrued interest by 307 million the irs has appealed the district court decision and accordingly its ultimate resolution is subject to change 

 

aftertax earnings from joint ventures totaled 1108 million in fiscal 2008 compared to 727 million in fiscal 2007 in fiscal 2008 net sales for cereal partners worldwide cpw grew 233 percent driven by higher volume key new product introductions including oats  more in the united kingdom and nesquik duo across a number of regions favorable foreign currency effects and the benefit of a full year of sales from the uncle tobys acquisition which closed in july 2006 our fiscal 2008 aftertax earnings from joint ventures was benefited by 159 million for our share of a gain on the sale of a cpw property in the united kingdom net sales for our häagendazs joint ventures in asia increased 157 percent in fiscal 2008 as a result of favorable

net interest for fiscal 2007 totaled 4265 million 269 million higher than net interest for fiscal 2006 higher interest rates caused nearly all of the increase net interest includes preferred distributions paid on minority interests the average rate on our total outstanding debt and minority interests was 63 percent in fiscal 2007 compared to 58 percent in fiscal 2006 

 

restructuring impairment and other exit costs totaled 393 million in fiscal 2007 as follows 

 

 

 

in fiscal 2007 we concluded that the future cash flows generated by certain product lines in our bakeries and foodservice segment would not be sufficient to recover the net book value of the related longlived assets and we recorded a noncash impairment charge against these assets 

 

the effective income tax rate was 343 percent for fiscal 2007 including an increase of 294 million in benefits from our international tax structure and benefits from the settlement of tax audits in fiscal 2006 our effective income tax rate was 345 percent including the benefit of 110 million of adjustments to deferred tax liabilities associated with our international segment’s brand intangibles

82 million in both fiscal 2007 and 2006 for our share of the restructuring costs mainly accelerated depreciation and severance net sales for our häagendazs joint ventures in asia declined 68 percent in fiscal 2007 reflecting a change in our reporting period for these joint ventures we changed this reporting period to include results through march 31 in previous years we included results for the twelve months ended april 30 accordingly fiscal 2007 included only 11 months of results from these joint ventures compared to 12 months in fiscal 2006 the impact of this change was not material to our consolidated results of operations so we did not restate prior periods for comparability 

 

average diluted shares outstanding decreased by 186 million from fiscal 2006 due to our repurchase of 253 million shares of stock during fiscal 2007 partially offset by increases in diluted shares outstanding from the issuance of annual stock awards 

 

results of segment operations 

our businesses are organized into three operating segments us retail international and bakeries and foodservice 

 

the following tables provide the dollar amount and percentage of net sales and operating profit from each reportable segment for fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006

segment operating profit 

 

 

 

segment operating profit excludes unallocated corporate items of 1567 million for fiscal 2008 1630 million for fiscal 2007 and 1228 million for fiscal 2006 and also excludes restructuring impairment and other exit costs because these items affecting operating profit are centrally managed at the corporate level and are excluded from the measure of segment profitability reviewed by our executive management 

 

us retail segment our us retail segment reflects business with a wide variety of grocery stores mass merchandisers membership stores natural food chains and drug dollar and discount chains operating throughout the united states our major product categories in this business segment are readytoeat cereals refrigerated yogurt readytoserve soup dry dinners shelf stable and frozen vegetables refrigerated and frozen dough products dessert and baking mixes frozen pizza and pizza snacks grain fruit and savory snacks microwave popcorn and a wide variety of organic products including soup granola bars and cereal

selected cash flows from our joint ventures are set forth in the following table 

 

selected cash flows from joint ventures 

 

 

 

impact of inflation 

we have experienced strong levels of input cost inflation since fiscal 2006 our gross margin performance in fiscal 2008 reflects the impact of significant input cost inflation primarily from commodities and energy inputs 

 

for fiscal 2009 we expect inflationary trends to accelerate with input costs fuel energy commodities and employee benefits forecasted to be 9 percent higher than fiscal 2008 levels we expect to mitigate this inflationary pressure through cost saving initiatives and pricing 

 

we attempt to minimize the effects of inflation through appropriate planning and operating practices our risk management practices are discussed in item 7a of this report 

 

liquidity 

the primary source of our liquidity is cash flow from operations over the most recent threeyear period our operations have generated 53 billion in cash a substantial portion of this operating cash flow has been returned to stockholders annually through share repurchases and dividends we also use this source of liquidity to fund our annual capital expenditures we typically 

 

use a combination of available cash notes payable and longterm debt to finance acquisitions and major capital expansions 

 

cash flows from operations 

 

 

 

our cash flow from operations decreased 213 million from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 as a 1508 million increase in net earnings and the 721 million effect of changes in deferred income taxes were more than offset by an increase of 2758 million in working capital compared to the prior year accounts receivable was a 699 million increased use of cash partially offset by a 373 million increase in cash from accounts payable and inventory was a 491 million increased use of cash in fiscal 2008 working capital also includes 596 million of marktomarket gains on our commodity derivatives in addition other current liabilities had a 1731 million reduction to the source of cash driven by cash taxes paid in fiscal 2008 

 

we strive to grow a key measure core working capital at or below our growth in net sales for fiscal 2008 core working capital grew 121 percent more than our net sales growth of 97 percent largely driven by the effect of increases in commodity prices on inventories and an increase in accounts receivable in fiscal 2007 core working capital grew 42 percent less than net sales growth of 62 percent and in fiscal 2006 core working capital grew 50 percent and net sales grew 36 percent 

 

the 923 million decrease in cash flows from operations from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 was the result of a reduction in our cash flows from working capital and a decrease in distributions of earnings from joint ventures offset by an increase in net earnings 

 

cash flows from investing activities 

 

 

 

in fiscal 2008 cash used by investing activities decreased by 1547 million from fiscal 2007 when we funded our share of cpw’s acquisition of the uncle tobys cereal business in australia reflected in acquisitions and investments in affiliates net acquired saxby bros limited and acquired our master franchisee of häagendazs shops in greece during fiscal 2008 we sold our former production facilities in vallejo california and allentown pennsylvania while in fiscal 2007 we sold our frozen pie product line including a plant in rochester new york and our parbaked bread product line including plants in chelsea massachusetts and tempe arizona capital investment for land buildings and equipment increased by 618 million as we continued to increase manufacturing capacity for our snack bars and yogurt products and began consolidating manufacturing for our old el paso business we expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately 550 million in fiscal 2009 including initiatives that will increase manufacturing capacity for yoplait yogurt nature valley bars and progresso soup increase productivity throughout the supply chain and continue upgrades to our international segment’s information technology systems

in october 2007 we entered into a new fiveyear credit agreement with an initial aggregate revolving commitment of 19 billion which is scheduled to expire in october 2012 concurrent with the execution of the new credit agreement we terminated our fiveyear credit agreement dated january 20 2004 which provided 7500 million of revolving credit and was scheduled to expire in january 2009 and our amended and restated credit agreement dated october 17 2006 which provided 11 billion of revolving credit and was scheduled to expire in october 2007 we then terminated our credit agreement dated august 3 2007 which provided an aggregate revolving commitment of 7500 million and was scheduled to expire on december 6 2007 

 

our credit facilities certain of our longterm debt agreements and our minority interests contain restrictive covenants as of may 25 2008 we were in compliance with all of these covenants 

 

we have 4420 million of longterm debt maturing in the next 12 months that is classified as current including 1095 million of notes that may mature based on the put rights of the note holders we also have classified 1506 million of longterm debt as current based on our intention to redeem the debt within the next 12 months we believe that cash flows from operations together with available short and longterm debt financing will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for at least the next 12 months 

 

as of may 25 2008 our total debt including the impact of derivative instruments designated as hedges was 657 percent in fixedrate and 343 percent in floatingrate instruments compared to 500 percent each in fixedrate and floatingrate instruments as of may 27 2007 the change in the fixedrate and floatingrate percentages were driven by the refinancing of 15 billion of commercial paper and minority interests with fixedrate notes and the new swap of 5000 million of floatingrate debt to fixedrate during fiscal 2008

we believe that growth in return on average total capital is a key performance measure return on average total capital improved from 111 percent in fiscal 2007 to 121 percent in fiscal 

 

2008 due to higher operating results the impact of net marktomarket gains on certain commodity positions and the effect of a discrete tax item we also believe important measures of financial strength are the ratio of fixed charge coverage and the ratio of operating cash flow to debt our fixed charge coverage ratio in fiscal 2008 was 487 compared to 437 in fiscal 2007 the measure increased from fiscal 2007 as earnings before income taxes and aftertax earnings from joint ventures increased by 1748 million and fixed charges decreased by 22 million our operating cash flow to debt ratio decreased 35 percent to 247 percent in fiscal 2008 driven by a slight decrease in cash flows from operations and an increase in our year end debt balance

promotional expenditures our promotional activities are conducted through our customers and directly or indirectly with end consumers these activities include payments to customers to perform merchandising activities on our behalf such as advertising or instore displays discounts to our list prices to lower retail shelf prices and payments to gain distribution of new products coupons contests and other incentives and media and advertising expenditures the media and advertising expenditures are recognized as expense when the advertisement airs the cost of payments to customers and other consumer activities are recognized as the related revenue is recorded which generally precedes the actual cash expenditure the recognition of these costs requires estimation of customer participation and performance levels these estimates are made based on the forecasted customer sales the timing and forecasted costs of promotional activities and other factors differences between estimated expenses and actual costs are normally insignificant and are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period our accrued trade coupon and consumer marketing liabilities were 4460 million as of may 25 2008 and 4101 million as of may 27 2007 because our total promotional expenditures including amounts classified as a reduction of revenues are significant if our estimates are inaccurate we would have to make adjustments that could have a material effect on our results of operations 

 

valuation of longlived assets longlived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the asset group are less than the carrying amount of the asset group asset groups have identifiable cash flows independent of other asset groups measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent appraisals as appropriate 

 

intangible assets goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred impairment testing is performed for each of our reporting units we compare the carrying value of a reporting unit including goodwill to the fair value of the unit carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we revalue all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit excluding goodwill to determine if the fair value of the net assets is greater than the net assets including goodwill if the fair value of the net assets is less than the net assets including goodwill impairment has occurred our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our annual longrange planning process we also make estimates of discount rates perpetuity growth assumptions market comparables and other factors 

 

we evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets mainly intangible assets associated with the pillsbury totino’s progresso green giant  old el paso häagendazs and uncle tobys brands to determine if they are finite or indefinitelived reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry known technological advances legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 

 

our indefinitelived intangible assets mainly brands are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be 

 

recoverable we performed our fiscal 2008 assessment of our brand intangibles as of december 1 2007 our estimate of the fair value of the brands was based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs which included projected revenues from our annual longrange plan assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands and a discount rate all brand intangibles had fair values in excess of their carrying values by at least 20 percent except for the pillsbury brand which we estimated had a fair value 3 percent higher than its carrying value this brand comprises nearly onehalf of our total indefinitelived intangible assets 

 

if the growth rate for the global revenue from all uses of the pillsbury brand decreases 50 basis points from the current planned growth rate fair value would be reduced by approximately 150 million assuming all other components of the fair value estimate remain unchanged if the assumed royalty rate for all uses of the pillsbury brand decreases by 50 basis points fair value would be reduced by approximately 130 million assuming all other components of the fair value estimate remain unchanged if the applicable discount rate increases by 50 basis points fair value of the pillsbury brand would be reduced by approximately 170 million assuming all other components of the fair value estimate remain unchanged as of may 25 2008 we reviewed each of the assumptions used in the annual impairment assessment performed as of december 1 2007 and found them to still be appropriate 

 

as of may 25 2008 we had 106 billion of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets while we currently believe that the fair value of each intangible exceeds its carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses could result in significant impairment losses and amortization expense 

 

stock compensation effective may 29 2006 we adopted sfas 123r which changed the accounting for compensation expense associated with stock options restricted stock awards and other forms of equity compensation we elected the modified prospective transition method as permitted by sfas 123r accordingly results from prior periods were not restated under this method stockbased compensation expense for fiscal 2007 was 1271 million which included amortization related to the remaining unvested portion of all equity compensation awards granted prior to may 29 2006 based on the grantdate fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” sfas 123 and amortization related to all equity compensation awards granted on or subsequent to may 29 2006 based on the grantdate fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas 123r the incremental effect on net earnings in fiscal 2007 of our adoption of sfas 123r was 688 million of expense 429 million aftertax all our stock compensation expense is recorded in sga expense in the consolidated statements of earnings 

 

prior to may 29 2006 we used the intrinsic value method for measuring the cost of compensation paid in our common stock no compensation expense for stock options was recognized in our consolidated statements of earnings prior to fiscal 2007 as the exercise price was equal to the market price of our stock at the date of grant expense attributable to other types of sharebased awards was recognized in our results under sfas 123 the estimated weightedaverage fair values of stock options granted and the assumptions used for the blackscholes optionpricing model were as follows 

 

 

 

the valuation of stock options is a significant accounting estimate which requires us to use judgments and assumptions that are likely to have a material impact on our financial statements annually we make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility employee exercise behavior and dividend yield 

 

we estimate our future stock price volatility using the historical volatility over the expected term of the option excluding time periods of volatility we believe a marketplace participant would exclude in estimating our stock price volatility for the fiscal 2008 grants we have excluded historical volatility for fiscal 2002 and prior primarily because volatility driven by our acquisition of the 

 

pillsbury company in fiscal 2002 does not reflect what we believe to be expected future volatility we also have considered but did not use implied volatility in our estimate because trading activity in options on our stock especially those with tenors of greater than 6 months is insufficient to provide a reliable measure of expected volatility if all other assumptions are held constant a one percentage point increase in our fiscal 2008 volatility assumption would increase the grantdate fair value of our fiscal 2008 option awards by 43 percent 

 

for fiscal 2007 and all prior periods our estimate of expected stock price volatility is based on historical volatility determined on a daily basis over the expected term of the options we considered but did not use implied volatility because we believed historical volatility provided an appropriate expectation for our volatility in the future 

 

our expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination within the valuation model separate groups of employees have similar historical exercise behavior and therefore were aggregated into a single pool for valuation purposes the weightedaverage expected term for all employee groups is presented in the table above an increase in the expected term by 1 year leaving all other assumptions constant would change the grant date fair value by significantly less than 1 percent our valuation model assumes that dividends and our share price increase in line with earnings resulting in a constant dividend yield the riskfree interest rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based on the us treasury zerocoupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant 

 

to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our assumptions we are not required to true up grantdate fair valuebased expense to final intrinsic values however these differences can impact the classification of cash tax benefits realized upon exercise of stock options as explained in the following two paragraphs furthermore historical data has a significant bearing on our forwardlooking assumptions significant variances between actual and predicted experience could lead to prospective revisions in our assumptions which could then significantly impact the yearoveryear comparability of stockbased compensation expense 

 

sfas 123r also provides that any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings referred to as a “windfall tax benefit” is presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows as a financing rather than an operating cash flow for fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 the windfall tax benefits classified as financing cash flow were 557 million and 731 million the actual impact on future years’ financing cash flow will depend in part on the volume of employee stock option exercises during a particular year and the relationship between the exercisedate market value of the underlying stock and the original grantdate fair value previously determined for financial reporting purposes 

 

realized windfall tax benefits are credited to additional paidin capital within the consolidated balance sheet realized shortfall tax benefits amounts which are less than that previously recognized in earnings are first offset against the cumulative balance of windfall tax benefits if any and then charged directly to income tax expense potentially resulting in volatility in our consolidated effective income tax rate we calculated a cumulative amount of windfall tax benefits from post1995 fiscal years for the purpose of accounting for future shortfall tax benefits and currently have sufficient cumulative windfall tax benefits to absorb projected arising shortfalls such that we do not currently expect future earnings to be affected by this provision however as employee stock option exercise behavior is not within our control it is possible that materially different reported results could occur if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail 

 

income taxes we adopted the provisions of fin 48 as of the beginning of fiscal 2008 prior to adoption our policy was to establish reserves that reflected the probable outcome of known tax contingencies the effects of final resolution if any were recognized as changes to the effective income tax rate in the period of resolution fin 48 requires application of a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions fin 48 permits us to recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement it further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings in the quarter of such change 

 

annually we file more than 350 income tax returns in approximately 100 global taxing jurisdictions a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or 

 

the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position we believe that our reserves for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome we adjust these reserves as well as the related interest in light of changing facts and circumstances settlement of any particular position would usually require the use of cash 

 

the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction our major taxing jurisdictions include the united states federal and state and canada we are no longer subject to united states federal examinations by the irs for fiscal years before 2002 during fiscal 2008 we received a favorable district court decision on an uncertain tax matter related to the fiscal years prior to 2002 and reduced our liability for uncertain tax positions by 210 million and related accrued interest by 97 million the irs has appealed the district court decision and accordingly its ultimate resolution is subject to change during the fiscal 2008 we also concluded various matters for fiscal years 19982001 which included a payment of 317 million the irs recently concluded field examinations for our 2002 and 2003 fiscal years a payment of 248 million was made to cover the additional tax liability plus interest related to all agreed adjustments for this audit cycle the irs also proposed additional adjustments for the 20022003 audit cycle including several adjustments to the tax benefits associated with the sale of minority interests in our gmc subsidiary we believe we have meritorious defenses and intend to vigorously defend our position our potential liability for this matter is significant and notwithstanding our reserves against this potential liability an unfavorable resolution could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations we do not expect the amount of our tax reserves for these issues to materially change in the next 12 months the irs initiated its audit of our fiscal 2004 through 2006 tax years during fiscal 2008 

 

various tax examinations by united states state taxing authorities could be conducted for any open tax year which vary by jurisdiction but are generally from 3 to 5 years currently several state examinations are in progress the canada revenue agency is conducting an audit of our income tax returns in canada for fiscal years 2003 which is our earliest tax year still open for examination through 2005 we do not anticipate that any united states state tax or canadian tax adjustments will have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 

 

defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefit plans we have defined benefit pension plans covering most domestic canadian and united kingdom employees benefits for salaried employees are based on length of service and final average compensation benefits for hourly employees include various monthly amounts for each year of credited service our funding policy is consistent with the requirements of applicable laws we made 142 million of voluntary contributions to these plans in fiscal 2008 our principal domestic retirement plan covering salaried employees has a provision that any excess pension assets would vest if the plan is terminated within five years of a change in control 

 

we also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to the majority of our domestic and canadian retirees the salaried health care benefit plan is contributory with retiree contributions based on years of service we fund related trusts for certain employees and retirees on an annual basis we did not make voluntary contributions to these plans in fiscal 2008 

 

under certain circumstances we also provide accruable benefits to former or inactive employees in the united states canada and mexico and members of our board of directors including severance and certain other benefits payable upon death we recognize an obligation for any of these benefits that vest or accumulate with service postemployment benefits that do not vest or accumulate with service such as severance based solely on annual pay rather than years of service are charged to expense when incurred our postemployment benefit plans are unfunded 

 

we recognize benefits provided during retirement or following employment over the plan participants’ active working life accordingly we make various assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement of our obligations assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our net periodic benefit expense or income and accumulated benefit obligations include the longterm rates of return on plan assets the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our benefit plans and the health care cost trend rates 

 

expected rate of return on plan assets our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation our historical longterm investment performance our estimate of future longterm returns by asset class using input from our 

 

actuaries investment services and investment managers and longterm inflation assumptions we review this assumption annually for each plan however our annual investment performance for one particular year does not by itself significantly influence our evaluation 

 

the investment objective for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans is to secure the benefit obligations to participants at a reasonable cost to us our goal is to optimize the longterm return on plan assets at a moderate level of risk the defined benefit pension and other postretirement portfolios are broadly diversified across asset classes within asset classes the portfolios are further diversified across investment styles and investment organizations for the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans the longterm investment policy allocations are 30 percent to equities in the united states 20 percent to international equities 10 percent to private equities 30 percent to fixed income and 10 percent to real assets real estate energy and timber the actual allocations to these asset classes may vary tactically around the longterm policy allocations based on relative market valuations 

 

our historical investment returns compound annual growth rates for our united states defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan assets were 4 percent 15 percent 10 percent 11 percent and 12 percent for the 1 5 10 15 and 20 year periods ended may 25 2008 

 

for fiscal 2008 we assumed on a weightedaverage basis for all defined benefit plans a rate of return of 94 percent for fiscal 2007 we assumed on a weightedaverage basis for all defined benefit plans a rate of return of 94 percent for fiscal 2006 we assumed on a weightedaverage basis for all defined benefit plan assets a rate of return of 96 percent our principal defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in the united states have an expected return on plan assets of 96 percent during fiscal 2007 we lowered the expected rate of return on one of our other postretirement plans in the united states based on costs associated with insurance contracts owned by that plan 

 

lowering the expected longterm rate of return on assets by 50 basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense by 21 million for fiscal 2009 a 50 basis point shortfall between the assumed and actual rate of return on plan assets for fiscal 2009 would result in a similar amount of arising assetexperience loss any arising assetexperience loss is recognized on a marketrelated valuation basis which reduces yeartoyear volatility this marketrelated valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the marketrelated value of assets and the actual return based on the marketrelated value of assets since the marketrelated value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a fiveyear period the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded our outside actuaries perform these calculations as part of our determination of annual expense or income 

 

discount rates our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of the last day of our fiscal year for all of our defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefit plan obligations those same discount rates also are used to determine defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefit plan income and expense for the following fiscal year we work with our actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan participants and using the top quartile of aarated corporate bond yields to develop a forward interest rate curve including a margin to that index based on our credit risk this forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions 

 

our weightedaverage discount rates were as follows 

 

weightedaverage discount rates 

 

 

 

lowering the discount rates by 50 basis points would increase our net defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefit plan expense for fiscal 2009 by approximately 18 million all obligationrelated experience gains and losses are amortized using a straightline method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants 

 

 

health care cost trend rates we review our health care trend rates annually our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims experience and information provided by our actuaries this information includes recent plan experience plan design overall industry experience and projections and assumptions used by other similar organizations our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with this review recent experiences and shortterm expectations our initial health care cost trend rate assumption is 1025 percent for retirees age 65 and over and 925 percent for retirees under age 65 these rates are graded down annually until the ultimate trend rate of 52 percent is reached in 2016 for all retirees the trend rates are applicable for calculations only if the retirees’ benefits increase as a result of health care inflation the ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually as necessary to approximate the current economic view on the rate of longterm inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium assumed trend rates for health care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans 

 

a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate would have the following effects 

 

 

 

any arising health care claims costrelated experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculation of expected future claims once recognized experience gains and losses are amortized using a straightline method over 15 years resulting in at least the minimum amortization required being recorded 

 

financial statement impact in fiscal 2008 we recorded net defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefit plan expense of 189 million compared to 362 million in fiscal 2007 and 297 million in fiscal 2006 as of may 25 2008 we had cumulative unrecognized actuarial net losses of 2768 million on our defined benefit pension plans 1156 million on our other postretirement benefit plans and 80 million on our postemployment benefit plans mainly as the result of decreases in our discount rate assumptions these unrecognized actuarial net losses will result in decreases in our future pension income and increases in postretirement expense since they currently exceed the corridors defined by gaap 

 

we use the retirement plans rp 2000 mortality table projected forward to our plans’ measurement dates for calculating the year end defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefit obligations and annual expense 

 

actual future net defined benefit pension other postretirement and postemployment benefit plan income or expense will depend on investment performance changes in future discount rates changes in health care trend rates and various other factors related to the populations participating in these plans

nongaap measures 

we have included in this report measures of financial performance that are not defined by gaap for each of these nongaap financial measures we are providing below a reconciliation of the differences between the nongaap measure and the most directly comparable gaap measure an explanation of why our management or the board of directors believes the nongaap measure provides useful information to investors and any additional purposes for which our management or board of directors uses the nongaap measure these nongaap measures should be viewed in addition to and not in lieu of the comparable gaap measure 

 

 

total segment operating profit this nongaap measure is used in reporting to our executive management and as a component of the board of directors’ measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes management and the board of directors believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is the profitability measure we use to evaluate segment performance a reconciliation of this measure to operating profit the relevant gaap measure is included in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

 

return on average total capital this ratio is not defined by gaap and is used in internal management reporting and as a component of the board of directors’ rating of our performance for incentive compensation purposes management and the board of directors believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is important for assessing the utilization of capital

tablestart 


 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates commodity prices and equity prices changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows in the normal course of business we actively manage our exposure to these market risks by entering into various hedging transactions authorized under established policies that place clear controls on these activities the counterparties in these transactions are generally highly rated institutions we establish credit limits for each counterparty our hedging transactions include but are not limited to a variety of derivative financial instruments 

 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixedrate debt and existing and future issuances of floatingrate debt primary exposures include us treasury rates libor and commercial paper rates in the united states and europe we use interest rate swaps and forwardstarting interest rate swaps to hedge our exposure to interest rate changes to reduce the volatility of our financing costs and to achieve a desired proportion of fixed versus floatingrate debt based on current and projected market conditions generally under these swaps we agree with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixedrate and floatingrate interest amounts based on an agreed notional principal amount as of may 25 2008 we had 41 billion of aggregate notional principal amount outstanding with a net notional amount of 4254 million that converts floatingrate notes to fixedrates this includes notional amounts of offsetting swaps that neutralize our exposure to interest rates on other interest rate swaps 

 

foreign exchange risk 

foreign currency fluctuations affect our net investments in foreign subsidiaries and foreign currency cash flows related to third party purchases intercompany loans and product shipments we are also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the us dollar our principal exposures are to the australian dollar british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese renminbi euro japanese yen and mexican peso we mainly use foreign currency forward contracts to selectively hedge our foreign currency cash flow exposures we generally do not hedge more than 12 months forward and generally do not hedge intercompany transactions we also have many net investments in foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in euros we hedge a portion of these net investments by issuing eurodenominated commercial paper as of may 25 2008 we had issued 4729 million of eurodenominated commercial paper and foreign exchange forward contracts that we have designated as a net investment hedge and thus deferred net foreign currency transaction losses of 696 million to accumulated other comprehensive income loss 

 

commodity price risk 

many commodities we use in the production and distribution of our products are exposed to market price risks we utilize derivatives to hedge price risk for our principal ingredient and energy costs including grains oats wheat and corn oils principally soybean nonfat dry milk natural gas and diesel fuel we manage our exposures through a combination of purchase orders longterm contracts with suppliers exchangetraded futures and options and overthecounter options and swaps we offset our exposures based on current and projected market conditions and generally seek to acquire the inputs at as close to our planned cost as possible as of may 25 2008 the net notional value of commodity derivatives was 7848 million of which 5248 million relates to agricultural positions and 2600 million relates to energy positions these hedges relate to inputs that generally will be utilized within the next 12 months 

 

equity instruments 

equity price movements affect our compensation expense as certain investments owned by our employees related to our deferred compensation plan are revalued we use equity swaps to manage this market risk 

 

value at risk 

the estimates in the table below are intended to measure the maximum potential fair value we could lose in one day from adverse changes in market interest rates foreign exchange rates commodity prices and equity prices under normal market conditions a monte carlo valueatrisk var methodology was used to quantify the market risk for our exposures the models assumed normal market conditions and used a 95 percent confidence level 

 

the var calculation used historical interest rates foreign exchange rates and commodity and equity prices from the past 

 

year to estimate the potential volatility and correlation of these rates in the future the market data were drawn from the riskmetrics tm data set the calculations are not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that we expect to incur further since the hedging instrument the derivative inversely correlates with the underlying exposure we would expect that any loss or gain in the fair value of our derivatives would be generally offset by an increase or decrease in the fair value of the underlying exposures the positions included in the calculations were debt investments interest rate swaps foreign exchange forwards commodity swaps futures and options and equity instruments the calculations do not include the underlying foreign exchange and commoditiesrelated positions that are hedged by these marketrisksensitive instruments 

 

the table below presents the estimated maximum potential var arising from a oneday loss in fair value for our interest rate foreign currency commodity and equity marketrisksensitive instruments outstanding as of may 25 2008 and may 27 2007 and the average fair value impact during the year ended may 25 2008

controls and procedures 

tableend we under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as of may 28 2006 based on our initial evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of may 28 2006 we subsequently have determined that our policies and procedures requiring an annual impairment assessment of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets on a combined basis were ineffective for the separate annual impairment assessment of our brand intangibles as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  accordingly we concluded that we had a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of may 28 2006 solely as a result of the aforementioned material weakness our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have now concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of may 28 2006 as of january 4 2007 we believe we have remediated the material weakness by changing our policies and procedures to require the performance of a separate annual impairment assessment of the brand intangibles and we have completed that assessment our assessments for fiscal years 2004 2005 and 2006 have confirmed that the fair value of brand intangibles exceeded their carrying value in all years therefore there were no changes to our consolidated financial statements presented in this report 

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our fiscal quarter ended may 28 2006 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

competition

the consumer foods market is highly competitive with numerous manufacturers of varying sizes in the united states and throughout the world the food categories in which we participate are very competitive our principal competitors in these categories all have substantial financial marketing and other resources we also compete with private label products offered by supermarkets mass merchants and other retailers such as club stores competition in our product categories is based on product innovation product quality price brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing promotional activity and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences our principal strategies for competing in each of our segments include superior product quality innovative advertising product promotion product innovation and price in most product categories we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products but also with generic 

  2

and private label products which are generally sold at lower prices internationally we compete with both multinational and local manufacturers and each country includes a unique group of competitors

customers

during fiscal 2006 one customer walmart stores inc walmart accounted for approximately 18 percent of our consolidated net sales and 24 percent of our sales in the us retail segment no other customer accounted for 10 percent or more of our consolidated net sales at may 28 2006 walmart accounted for 17 percent of our trade receivables invoiced in the us retail segment the top five customers in our us retail segment accounted for approximately 47 percent of its fiscal 2006 net sales and the top five customers in our bakeries and foodservice segment accounted for approximately 36 percent of its fiscal 2006 net sales

seasonality

in general demand for our products is evenly balanced throughout the year however within our us retail segment demand for refrigerated dough frozen baked goods and baking products is stronger in the fourth calendar quarter demand for progresso soup and green giant canned and frozen vegetables is higher during the fall and winter months

internationally demand for häagendazs ice cream is higher during the summer months and demand for baking mix and dough products increases during winter months due to the offsetting impact of these demand trends as well as the different seasons in the northern and southern hemispheres our international net sales are generally evenly balanced throughout the year

trademarks and patents

trademarks and service marks are vital to our businesses our products are marketed under trademarks and service marks that are owned by or licensed to us the most significant trademarks and service marks used in our businesses are set forth in italics in this report these marks include the trademarks used in our international joint ventures that are owned by or licensed to the joint ventures in addition some of our products are marketed under or in combination with trademarks that have been licensed from others including reese’s puffs cereal hershey’s chocolate included with a variety of products dora the explorer for yogurt and cereal and a variety of characters and brands used on fruit snacks including sunkist my little pony  animal planet  care bears and various warner bros characters we use the yoplait trademark in connection with our yogurt business in the united states under the terms of a license agreement with a third party licensor us trademark and service mark registrations are generally for a term of 10 years renewable every 10 years as long as the trademark is used in the regular course of trade

given our focus on developing and marketing innovative proprietary products we consider the collective rights under our various patents which expire from time to time a valuable asset but we do not believe that our businesses are materially dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents

backlog

orders are generally filled within a few days of receipt and are subject to cancellation at any time prior to shipment the backlog of any unfilled orders at may 28 2006 was not material

raw materials and supplies

the principal raw materials that we use are cereal grains sugar dairy products vegetables fruits meats vegetable oils and other agricultural products as well as paper and plastic packaging materials operating supplies and energy we have some longterm fixed price contracts but the majority of our raw materials are purchased on the open market we believe that we will be able to obtain an adequate supply of needed ingredients and packaging materials occasionally and where possible we make advance purchases of items significant to our business in order to ensure continuity of operations our objective is to procure materials meeting both our quality standards and our production needs at price levels that allow a targeted profit margin since commodities generally represent the largest variable cost in manufacturing our products to the extent possible we hedge the risk associated with adverse price movements using exchangetraded futures and options forward cash contracts and overthecounter derivatives see also note six to the consolidated financial statements on pages 40 through 42 in item eight of this report and item seven a on page 27 of this report

capital expenditures

during the fiscal year ended may 28 2006 our aggregate capital expenditures for land buildings and equipment were 360 million we expect to spend approximately 425 million for capital projects in fiscal 2007 primarily for fixed assets to support further growth and increase supply chain productivity

research and development

employees

food quality and safety regulation

the manufacture and sale of consumer food products is highly regulated in the united states our activities are subject to regulation by various government agencies including the food and drug administration department of agriculture federal trade commission department of commerce and environmental protection agency as well as various state and local agencies our business is also regulated by similar agencies outside of the united states

environmental matters

as of july 27 2006 we were involved with the following active cleanup sites associated with the alleged release or threatened release of hazardous substances or wastes

 

these matters involve several different actions including administrative proceedings commenced by regulatory agencies and demand letters by regulatory agencies and private parties

we recognize that our potential exposure with respect to any of these sites may be joint and several but have concluded that our probable aggregate exposure is not material this conclusion is based upon among other things our payments and accruals with respect to each site the number ranking and financial strength of other potentially responsible parties identified at each of the sites the status of the proceedings including various settlement agreements consent decrees or court orders allocations of volumetric waste contributions and allocations of relative responsibility among potentially responsible parties developed by regulatory agencies and by private parties remediation cost estimates prepared by governmental authorities or private technical consultants and our historical experience in negotiating and settling disputes with respect to similar sites

our operations are subject to the clean air act clean water act resource conservation and recovery act comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act and all similar state environmental laws applicable to the jurisdictions in which we operate

based on current facts and circumstances we believe that neither the results of our environmental proceedings 

  4

nor our compliance in general with environmental laws or regulations will have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position

cautionary statement relevant to forwardlooking information for the purpose of “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995

this report contains or incorporates by reference forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 that are based on our management’s current expectations and assumptions we and our representatives also may from time to time make written or oral forwardlooking statements including statements contained in our filings with the sec and in our reports to stockholders

the words or phrases “will likely result” “are expected to” “will continue” “is anticipated” “estimate” “plan” “project” or similar expressions identify “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results and those currently anticipated or projected we wish to caution you not to place undue reliance on any such forwardlooking statements which speak only as of the date made

in connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 we are identifying important factors that could affect our financial performance and could cause our actual results for future periods to differ materially from any opinions or statements expressed with respect to future periods in any current statements

our future results could be affected by a variety of factors such as competitive dynamics in the consumer foods industry and the markets for our products including new product introductions advertising activities pricing actions and promotional activities of our competitors economic conditions including changes in inflation rates interest rates or tax rates product development and innovation consumer acceptance of new products and product improvements consumer reaction to pricing actions and changes in promotion levels acquisitions or dispositions of businesses or assets changes in capital structure changes in laws and regulations including labeling and advertising regulations changes in accounting standards and the impact of significant accounting estimates product quality and safety issues including recalls and product liability changes in customer demand for our products effectiveness of advertising marketing and promotional programs changes in consumer behavior trends and preferences including weight loss trends consumer perception of healthrelated issues including obesity consolidation in the retail environment changes in purchasing and inventory levels of significant customers fluctuations in the cost and availability of supply chain resources including raw materials packaging and energy disruptions or inefficiencies in the supply chain benefit plan expenses due to changes in

you should also consider the risk factors that we identify on pages 7 through 10 in item one a of this report which could also affect our future results

 item 1a   risk factors

various risks and uncertainties could affect our business any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this report or our other filings with the sec could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial also may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in the future therefore the following is not intended to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties

the food categories in which we participate are very competitive and if we are not able to compete effectively our results of operations would be adversely affected

the food categories in which we participate are very competitive our principal competitors in these categories all have substantial financial marketing and other resources we also compete with private label products offered by supermarkets mass merchants and other retailers such as club stores competition in our product categories is based on product innovation product quality price brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing promotional activity and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences if our large competitors were to decrease their pricing or were to increase their promotional spending we could choose to do the same which could adversely affect our margins and profitability if we did not do the same our revenues and market share could be adversely affected our market share and revenue growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing innovative products in response to changing consumer demands or by new product introductions of our competitors if we are unable to build and sustain brand equity by offering recognizably superior product quality we may be unable to maintain premium pricing over private label products

we may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face of a consolidating retail environment

our five largest customers in our us retail segment together accounted for approximately 47 percent of that segment’s net sales for fiscal 2006 the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could adversely affect our sales and profits in addition as the retail grocery trade continues to consolidate and mass market retailers become larger our large retail customers may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency lower pricing and increased promotional programs if we are unable to use our scale marketing expertise product innovation and category leadership positions to respond to these demands our profitability or volume growth could be negatively impacted

price changes for the commodities we depend on for raw materials and packaging may adversely affect our profitability

the raw materials used in our business include cereal grains sugar dairy products vegetables fruits meats vegetable oils and other agricultural products as well as paper and plastic packaging materials operating supplies and energy these items are largely commodities that experience price volatility caused by external conditions such as weather and product scarcity commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations and changes in governmental agricultural programs commodity price changes may result in unexpected increases in raw material packaging and energy costs if we are unable to increase productivity to offset these increased costs or increase our prices as a result of consumer sensitivity to pricing or otherwise we may experience reduced margins and profitability we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and the hedging procedures that we do use may not always work as we intend

if we are not efficient in our production our profitability could suffer as a result of the highly competitive environment in which we operate

our future success and earnings growth depends in part on our ability to be efficient in the production and manufacture of our products in highly competitive markets our ability to gain additional efficiencies may become more difficult over time as we take advantage of existing opportunities our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or by eliminating redundant costs resulting from acquisitions could adversely affect our profitability and also weaken our competitive position further many productivity initiatives involve complex reorganization of 

  7

manufacturing facilities and production lines such manufacturing realignment may result in the interruption of production which may negatively impact product volume and margins

disruption of our supply chain could adversely affect our business

our ability to make move and sell products is critical to our success damage or disruption to our manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather natural disaster fire terrorism pandemic strikes or other reasons could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or to effectively manage such events if they occur particularly when a product is sourced from a single location could adversely affect our business and results of operations as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain

we may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and trends which may result in decreased demand for our products

our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes and eating habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences consumer preferences change from time to time and can be affected by a number of different trends our failure to anticipate identify or react to these changes and trends and to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis could result in reduced demand for our products which would in turn cause our revenues and profitability to suffer similarly demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns regarding the health effects of ingredients such as trans fats sugar processed wheat or other product ingredients or attributes

we may be unable to grow our market share or add products that are in faster growing and more profitable categories

the food industry’s growth potential is constrained by population growth our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business faster than populations are growing in the markets that we serve one way to achieve that growth is to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new products in faster growing and more profitable categories our future results will also depend on our ability to increase market share in our existing product categories if we do not succeed in developing innovative products for new and existing categories our growth may slow which could adversely affect our profitability

customer demand for our products may be limited in future periods as a result of increased purchases in response to promotional activity

our unit volume in the last week of each quarter is consistently higher than the average for the preceding weeks of the quarter in comparison to the average daily shipments in the first 12 weeks of a quarter the final week of each quarter has approximately two to four days’ worth of incremental shipments based on a fiveday week reflecting increased promotional activity at the end of the quarter this increased activity includes promotions to assure that our customers have sufficient inventory on hand to support major marketing events or increased seasonal demand early in the next quarter as well as promotions intended to help achieve interim unit volume targets if due to quarterend promotions or other reasons our customers purchase more product in any reporting period than endconsumer demand will require in future periods our sales level in future reporting periods could be adversely affected

economic downturns could cause consumers to shift their food purchases from our higher priced premium products to lower priced items which could adversely affect our results of operations

the willingness of consumers to purchase premium branded food products depends in part on local economic conditions in periods of economic uncertainty consumers tend to purchase more private label or other economy brands in those circumstances we could experience a reduction in sales of higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings in addition as a result of economic conditions or otherwise we may be unable to raise our prices as a result of increased consumer sensitivity to pricing any of these events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations

our international operations are subject to political and economic risks

in fiscal 2006 approximately 16 percent of our consolidated net sales were generated outside of the united states we are accordingly subject to a number of risks relating to doing business internationally any of which could significantly harm our business these risks include

   8

our financial performance on a us dollar denominated basis is subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates these fluctuations could cause our results of operations to vary materially from period to period from time to time we enter into agreements that are intended to reduce the effects of our exposure to currency fluctuations but these agreements may not be effective in significantly reducing our exposure

concerns with the safety and quality of food products could cause consumers to avoid our products

we could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients adverse publicity about these types of concerns whether or not valid may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions

if our food products become adulterated or misbranded we might need to recall those items and may experience product liability claims if consumers are injured

we may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated or misbranded we may also be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes injury a widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time we could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us a significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity damage to our reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in our food products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands

new regulations or regulatorybased claims could adversely affect our business

food production and marketing are highly regulated by a variety of federal state local and foreign agencies changes in laws or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements on us could increase our cost of doing business or restrict our actions causing our results of operations to be adversely affected in addition we advertise our products and could be the target of claims relating to false or deceptive advertising under federal state and foreign laws and regulations

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could limit financing and other options and in some cases adversely affect our ability to pay dividends

as of may 28 2006 we had total debt and minority interests of approximately 72 billion the agreements under which we have issued indebtedness do not prevent us from incurring additional unsecured indebtedness in the future

our level of indebtedness may limit our

 there are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments and minority interests if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the related indebtedness and minority interests and other unrelated indebtedness could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity a default under our debt instruments and minority interests may also significantly affect our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing

if our subsidiary general mills cereals llc gmc fails to make required distributions to the holders of the b1 interests of gmc we will be restricted from paying any dividends other than dividends in the form of shares of common stock or other distributions on shares of our common stock and may not repurchase or redeem shares of our common stock until such distributions are paid

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt and other obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control

volatility in the securities markets interest rates and other factors or changes in our employee base could substantially increase our pension and postretirement costs

we sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the united states canada and various foreign locations including pension retiree health and welfare severance and other postemployment plans our major pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a diversified portfolio changes in interest rates mortality rates health care costs early retirement rates investment returns and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our pension and postretirement plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plans although the aggregate fair value of our pension and postretirement plan assets exceeded the aggregate pension and postretirement benefit obligations as of may 28 2006 a significant increase in future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations or cash flows from operations

if other potentially responsible parties prps are unable to contribute to remediation costs at certain contaminated sites our costs for remediation could be material

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign environmental and health and safety laws and regulations under certain of these laws namely the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and its state counterparts liability for investigation and remediation of hazardous substance contamination at currently or formerly owned or operated facilities or at thirdparty waste disposal sites is joint and several we currently are involved in active remediation efforts at certain sites where we have been named a prp if other prps at these sites are unable to contribute to remediation costs we could be held responsible for all or their portion of the remediation costs and those costs could be material we cannot assure you that our costs in relation to these environmental matters or compliance with environmental laws in general will not exceed our reserves or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations

an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other intangibles could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth

goodwill represents the difference between the purchase prices of acquired companies and the related fair values of net assets acquired goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred impairment testing is performed for each of our reporting units we compare the carrying amount of goodwill for a reporting unit with its fair value and if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value an impairment has occurred

the costs of patents copyrights and other intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives intangibles with indefinite lives principally brands are carried at cost finite and indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable an impairment loss would be recognized when fair value is less than the carrying amount of the intangible

our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs from our annual longrange planning process we also make estimates of discount rates perpetuity growth assumptions and other factors

as of may 28 2006 we had 103 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets events and conditions that could result in an impairment include changes in the industries in which we operate including competition and advances in technology a significant product liability or intellectual property claim or other factors leading to reduction in expected sales or profitability should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired our consolidated net earnings and net worth may be materially adversely affected by a noncash charge

resolution of uncertain income tax matters could adversely affect our cash flows from operations

we accrue income tax liabilities for potential assessments related to uncertain tax positions in a variety of taxing jurisdictions an unfavorable resolution of these matters including the accounting for losses recorded as part of the pillsbury transaction could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows from operations

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

tableend executive overview

we are a global consumer foods company we develop differentiated food products and market these valueadded products under unique brand names we work continuously on product innovation to improve our established brands and to create new products that meet consumers’ evolving needs and preferences in addition we build the equity of our brands over time with strong consumerdirected marketing and innovative merchandising we believe our brandbuilding strategy is the key to winning and sustaining leading share positions in markets around the globe

our businesses are organized into three reportable segments us retail reflects business with a wide variety of grocery stores mass merchandisers club stores specialty stores and drug dollar and discount chains operating throughout the united states our major product categories in this business segment are readytoeat cereals meals refrigerated and frozen dough products baking products snacks yogurt and organic foods our international segment is made up of retail businesses outside of the united states including a retail business in canada that largely mirrors our us retail product mix and foodservice businesses outside of the united states and canada our bakeries and foodservice segment consists of products marketed throughout the united states and canada to retail and wholesale bakeries commercial and noncommercial foodservice distributors and operators restaurants and convenience stores

our fundamental business goal is to generate superior returns for our stockholders over the long term in the most recent fiscal year our total return to stockholders including stock price appreciation and dividends was 72 percent while the sp 500 index returned 88 percent from fiscal 2001 to 2006 our total return to stockholders averaged 68 percent per year while the sp 500 index posted a 18 percent average annual return over the same period

our longterm growth objectives are

   12

these measures combined with an attractive dividend yield and improvement in return on capital drive the management of our business

for the fiscal year ended may 28 2006 our net sales grew 4 percent and total segment operating profit grew 5 percent in line with our longterm goals diluted eps decreased 6 percent in fiscal 2006 however excluding the eps effects of our convertible debentures in both fiscal years and the fiscal 2005 net benefit of gains on divestitures and debt repurchase costs our diluted eps grew 8 percent in line with our longterm goal see page 24 for our discussion of this measure not defined by gaap our net cash provided by operations increased to nearly 18 billion in 2006 enabling us to increase our annual dividend payments by 8 percent from fiscal 2005 continue to return cash to stockholders via share repurchases which totaled 885 million in fiscal 2006 and repay 189 million of debt we continued to reinvest in the longterm growth in our brands increasing advertising by 8 percent from fiscal 2005 and we also continued to make significant capital investments to support future growth and productivity as we spent 360 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2006 finally our return on average total capital improved by 60 basis points see page 25 for our discussion of this measure not defined by gaap

results for fiscal 2006 were negatively impacted by increased fuel and commodity costs and higher advertising spending details of our financial results are provided in the “fiscal 2006 consolidated results of operations” section below

as we begin fiscal 2007 we have momentum in several of our key businesses we must sustain that momentum and restore net sales growth in two operating units that did not grow in fiscal 2006 – big g cereals and pillsbury usa we plan to launch new products achieve competitive levels of retailer merchandising activity and increase advertising in big g cereals in fiscal 2007 in pillsbury usa we plan to launch new products and focus consumer marketing support to improve product mix we expect our worldwide food business to achieve another year of good sales and operating profit growth we also intend to deliver more growth from new products and accelerate our performance in fastgrowing channels such as drug stores dollar stores and club formats finally we plan to expand our margins by focusing on realizing price increases managing our input costs and achieving productivity through supply chain and administrative costsaving efforts we expect our fiscal 2007 interest expense to be 40 million higher than in fiscal 2006 primarily due to higher interest rates we also expect the impact of the adoption of a new accounting standard for stockbased compensation to reduce earnings by 011 to 012 per diluted share in fiscal 2007 and we expect our effective tax rate to increase 75 to 125 basis points over the fiscal 2006 effective rate of 345 percent

fiscal 2006 consolidated results of operations

for fiscal 2006 we reported diluted eps of 290 down 6 percent from 308 per share earned in fiscal 2005 excluding the effects of our convertible debentures in both fiscal years and excluding the fiscal 2005 net benefit of gains on divestitures and debt repurchase costs diluted eps increased 8 percent from 275 in fiscal 2005 to 298 in fiscal 2006 earnings after tax were 1090 million in fiscal 2006 down 12 percent from 1240 million in fiscal 2005 reflecting the net benefit of gains on divestitures and debt repurchase costs in fiscal 2005

net sales for fiscal 2006 grew 4 percent to 116 billion driven by 2 percentage points of unit volume growth primarily in us retail and international and 1 percentage point of growth from pricing and product mix across many of our businesses promotional spending and foreign currency exchange effects were flat compared to fiscal 2005 the components of net sales growth are shown in the following table

components of net sales growth

 

 cost of sales was up 132 million in fiscal 2006 versus fiscal 2005 primarily due to unit volume increases as manufacturing efficiencies largely offset cost increases due to inflation also the yearoveryear change in cost of sales was favorably impacted by the following costs incurred in fiscal 2005 18 million in expense from accelerated depreciation associated with exit activities as described below and 5 million of product recall costs cost of sales as a percent of net sales decreased from 608 percent in fiscal 2005 to 599 percent in fiscal 2006

selling general and administrative sga expense increased by 260 million in fiscal 2006 versus fiscal 2005 sga as a percent of net sales increased from 215 percent in fiscal 2005 to 230 percent in fiscal 2006 the increase in sga from fiscal 2005 was largely the result of a 97 million increase in domestic employee benefit costs including incentives an 86 million increase in customer freight expense primarily due to increased fuel costs a 46 million increase in consumer marketing spending and 23 million of increases in our environmental reserves

net interest expense for fiscal 2006 totaled 399 million lower than interest expense for fiscal 2005 of 455 million primarily as the result of debt pay down and the maturation of interest rate swaps interest expense includes preferred 

  13

distributions paid on subsidiary minority interests we have in place an amount of interest rate swaps that convert 500 million of fixedrate debt to floating rates taking into account the effect of our interest rate swaps the average interest rate on our total outstanding debt and subsidiary minority interests was 64 percent at may 28 2006 compared to 54 percent at may 29 2005

in fiscal 2006 we recorded restructuring and other exit costs of 30 million consisting of 13 million related to the closure of our swedesboro new jersey frozen dough plant 6 million primarily for severance costs associated with the restructuring of our frozen dough plant in montreal quebec 4 million of restructuring costs at our allentown pennsylvania frozen waffle plant primarily related to product and production realignment 3 million associated with an asset impairment charge in one of our plants and 4 million primarily associated with fiscal 2005 supply chain initiatives in fiscal 2005 we recorded restructuring and other exit costs of 84 million consisting of 44 million of charges associated with fiscal 2005 supply chain initiatives 30 million of charges related to relocating our frozen baked goods line from our boston plant 3 million of charges primarily associated with bakeries and foodservice severance and 7 million of charges associated with restructuring actions prior to fiscal 2005 the fiscal 2005 supply chain initiatives were undertaken to further increase asset utilization and reduce manufacturing and sourcing costs resulting in decisions regarding plant closures and production realignment the actions included decisions to close our flour milling plant in vallejo california close our parbaked bread plant in medley florida relocate bread production from our swedesboro new jersey plant relocate a portion of our cereal production from cincinnati ohio close our snacks foods plant in iowa city iowa and close our dry mix production at trenton ontario

the effective income tax rate was 345 percent for fiscal 2006 reflecting the benefit of 11 million of adjustments to deferred tax liabilities associated with our international segment’s brand intangibles in fiscal 2005 our effective income tax rate was 366 percent driven primarily by the tax impacts of our fiscal 2005 divestitures

earnings after tax from joint ventures totaled 64 million in fiscal 2006 compared to 89 million in fiscal 2005 earnings from joint ventures in fiscal 2005 included 28 million from our snack ventures europe sve joint venture with pepsico inc which was divested on february 28 2005 in fiscal 2006 unit volume for cereal partners worldwide cpw our joint venture with nestlé sa grew 6 percent and net sales were up 4 percent in february 2006 cpw announced a restructuring of its manufacturing plants in the united kingdom our aftertax earnings from joint ventures was reduced by 8 million for our share of the restructuring costs primarily accelerated depreciation and severance incurred in fiscal 2006 our share of the remainder of cpw’s restructuring costs is expected to affect our aftertax earnings from joint ventures in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2008 net sales for our häagendazs joint ventures in asia declined 7 percent from fiscal 2005 due to an unseasonably cold winter and increased competitive pressure in japan 8th continent our joint venture with dupont achieved 14 percent net sales growth in fiscal 2006

average diluted shares outstanding decreased by 30 million from fiscal 2005 this was due primarily to the repurchase of a significant portion of our contingently convertible debentures in october 2005 and the completion of a consent solicitation related to the remaining convertible debentures in december 2005 actions that ended the dilutive accounting effect of these debentures in our eps calculations in addition we repurchased 19 million shares of our stock during fiscal 2006 partially offset by the issuance of shares upon stock option exercises

fiscal 2005 consolidated results of operations

earnings per diluted share of 308 in fiscal 2005 were up 18 percent from 260 in fiscal 2004 primarily due to the gain from the redemption of our sve interest and the reduction in interest expense earnings after tax increased to 1240 million up 18 percent from 1055 million in fiscal 2004 our cash flow in 2005 was strong enabling us to increase our dividend payments continue to make significant fixed asset investments to support future growth and productivity and reduce our total debt notes payable and longterm debt including current portion by 20 billion

our net sales for fiscal 2005 were 112 billion an increase of 2 percent for the year compared to sales in fiscal 2004 excluding the effect of the 53rd week in 2004 net sales increased 3 percent see page 26 for our discussion of this measure not defined by gaap net sales growth was primarily driven by 2 percentage points of unit volume growth on a 52 vs 52week basis primarily in us retail and international pricing and product mix across many of our businesses contributed 3 percentage points of growth however increases in promotional spending primarily in us retail offset that effect foreign currency exchange effects contributed 1 percentage point of growth the components of net sales growth are shown in the following table

  14

components of net sales growth

 

cost of sales increased by 250 million to 6834 million primarily driven by unit volume increases and 170 million in commodity cost increases

sga costs decreased by 25 million from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 primarily driven by four factors a 54 million decrease in consumer marketing expense a 37 million increase in distribution costs a 34 million decrease in mergerrelated costs for the planning and execution of the integration of pillsbury and a 32 million increase in unallocated corporate items

as detailed above in “fiscal 2006 consolidated results of operations” restructuring and other exit costs were 84 million in fiscal 2005 compared to 26 million in 2004

on march 23 2005 we commenced a cash tender offer for our outstanding 6 percent notes due in 2012 the tender offer resulted in the purchase of 500 million principal amount of the notes subsequent to the expiration of the tender offer we purchased an additional 260 million principal amount of the notes in the open market the aggregate purchases resulted in debt repurchase costs of 137 million consisting of 73 million of noncash interest rate swap losses reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income 59 million of purchase premium and 5 million of noncash unamortized cost of issuance expense

on february 28 2005 sve was terminated and our 405 percent interest was redeemed on april 4 2005 we sold our lloyd’s barbecue business to hormel foods corporation we received 799 million in cash proceeds from these dispositions and recorded 499 million in gains in fiscal 2005

net interest expense decreased 10 percent from 508 million in fiscal 2004 to 455 million in fiscal 2005 primarily due to a reduction of our debt levels

in fiscal 2005 our effective income tax rate increased to 366 percent driven primarily by the tax impacts of our fiscal 2005 divestitures the higher book tax expense related to the fiscal 2005 divestitures did not result in the payment of significant cash taxes our effective income tax rate was 350 percent in fiscal 2004

aftertax earnings from joint venture operations grew 20 percent to reach 89 million in fiscal 2005 compared with 74 million reported a year earlier this increase was primarily due to unit volume gains by our continuing joint ventures

average diluted shares outstanding were 409 million in fiscal 2005 down 1 percent from 413 million in fiscal 2004 as the repurchase of 17 million shares from diageo was partially offset by stock option exercises

fiscal 2006 unit volume was flat as compared to fiscal 2005 with net price realization and product mix making up the primary increase in net sales growth for the fiscal year in fiscal 2005 unit volume was down 5 percent compared with fiscal 2004 or down 3 percent on a comparable 52week basis reflecting softness in shipments to our foodservice distributors and bakery customers that was partially offset by growth in sales to convenience stores

the change in net sales by major customer category is set forth in the following table

bakeries and foodservice change in net sales

 

operating profits for the segment were 139 million in fiscal 2006 up 4 percent from 134 million in fiscal 2005 unit volume was flat and pricing actions essentially covered manufacturing and distribution rate increases of 39 million

fiscal 2005 operating profits were up slightly at 134 million versus 132 million in fiscal 2004 the unit volume decline reduced earnings by 22 million but 70 million of net pricing realization more than offset manufacturing and distribution rate increases

unallocated corporate items

for fiscal 2006 unallocated corporate expenses were 123 million compared to 32 million in fiscal 2005 fiscal 2006 included higher domestic employee benefit expense including incentives that increased by 61 million over 

  17

fiscal 2005 increases in environmental reserves of 23 million and a 10 million writedown of the asset value of a lowincome housing investment

unallocated corporate expenses in fiscal 2005 included 18 million in costs classified as cost of sales associated with restructuring and other exit activities fiscal 2004 expense was 17 million including mergerrelated costs of 34 million

joint ventures

net sales growth for cpw in fiscal 2006 was restrained by unfavorable foreign currency effects our share of aftertax joint venture earnings decreased from 89 million in fiscal 2005 to 64 million in fiscal 2006 as noted above this reflects the absence of sve earnings and the inclusion of 8 million of restructuring costs for cpw in fiscal 2006

joint venture change in net sales

 

our interest in sve was redeemed in february 2005 and therefore is excluded from the table above see page 26 for our discussion of this measure not defined by gaap

our share of aftertax joint venture earnings increased from 74 million in fiscal 2004 to 89 million in fiscal 2005 primarily due to unit volume gains in our continuing ventures

impact of inflation

it is our view that changes in the general rate of inflation have not had a significant effect on profitability over the three most recent fiscal years other than as noted above related to commodities and employee benefit costs we attempt to minimize the effects of inflation through appropriate planning and operating practices our risk management practices are discussed on pages 7 through 10 in item seven a of this report

liquidity and capital resources

sources and uses of cash in the past three fiscal years are shown in the following table over the most recent threeyear period our operations have generated 49 billion in cash in fiscal 2006 cash flow from operations totaled nearly 18 billion the increase in cash flows from operations from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 was primarily the result of increases in accrued compensation and accrued income taxes the increase in cash flows from operations from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 was primarily the result of increases in accrued income taxes resulting from cash benefits from the utilization of capital losses for tax purposes

cash sources uses

 

in fiscal 2006 capital investment for land buildings and equipment decreased to 360 million from 434 million in fiscal 2005 we expect capital expenditures of approximately 425 million in fiscal 2007

dividends paid in fiscal 2006 totaled 485 million or 134 per share an 8 percent increase from fiscal 2005 dividends of 124 per share our board of directors announced a quarterly dividend increase from 031 per share to 033 per share effective with the dividend paid on august 1 2005 a quarterly dividend increase to 034 per share effective with the dividend paid on february 1 2006 and another quarterly dividend increase to 035 per share effective with the dividend payable on august 1 2006

our board of directors has authorized the repurchase from time to time of shares of our common stock subject to a maximum of 170 million shares held in our treasury 

  18

during fiscal 2006 we repurchased 19 million shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 892 million of which 7 million settled after the end of our fiscal year in fiscal 2005 we repurchased 17 million shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 771 million a total of 146 million shares were held in treasury at may 28 2006

we also used cash from operations to repay 189 million in outstanding debt in fiscal 2006 in fiscal 2005 we repaid nearly 22 billion of debt including the purchase of 760 million principal amount of our 6 percent notes due in 2012 fiscal 2005 debt repurchase costs were 137 million consisting of 73 million of noncash interest rate swap losses reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income 59 million of purchase premium and 5 million of noncash unamortized cost of issuance expense

capital structure

 

we have 21 billion of longterm debt maturing in the next 12 months and classified as current including 131 million that may mature in fiscal 2007 based on the put rights of those note holders we believe that cash flows from operations together with available short and longterm debt financing will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for at least the next 12 months

on october 28 2005 we repurchased a significant portion of our zero coupon convertible debentures pursuant to put rights of the holders for an aggregate purchase price of 133 billion including 77 million of accreted original issue discount these debentures had an aggregate principal amount at maturity of 186 billion we incurred no gain or loss from this repurchase as of may 28 2006 there were 371 million in aggregate principal amount at maturity of the debentures outstanding or 268 million of accreted value we used proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper to fund the purchase price of the debentures we also have reclassified the remaining zero coupon convertible debentures to longterm debt based on the october 2008 put rights of the holders

on march 23 2005 we commenced a cash tender offer for our outstanding 6 percent notes due in 2012 the tender offer resulted in the purchase of 500 million principal amount of the notes subsequent to the expiration of the tender offer we purchased an additional 260 million principal amount of the notes in the open market the aggregate purchases resulted in the debt repurchase costs as discussed above

our minority interests consist of interests in certain of our subsidiaries that are held by third parties general mills cereals llc gmc our subsidiary holds the manufacturing assets and intellectual property associated with the production and retail sale of big g readytoeat cereals progresso soups and old el paso products in may 2002 one of our wholly owned subsidiaries sold 150000 class a preferred membership interests in gmc to an unrelated thirdparty investor in exchange for 150 million and in october 2004 another of our wholly owned subsidiaries sold 835000 series b1 preferred membership interests in gmc in exchange for 835 million all interests in gmc other than the 150000 class a interests and 835000 series b1 interests but including all managing member interests are held by our wholly owned subsidiaries in fiscal 2003 general mills capital inc gm capital a subsidiary formed for the purpose of purchasing and collecting our receivables sold 150 million of its series a preferred stock to an unrelated thirdparty investor

the class a interests of gmc receive quarterly preferred distributions at a floating rate equal to i the sum of threemonth libor plus 90 basis points divided by ii 0965 this rate will be adjusted by agreement between the thirdparty investor holding the class a interests and gmc every five years beginning in june 2007 under certain circumstances gmc also may be required to be dissolved and liquidated including without limitation the bankruptcy of gmc or its subsidiaries failure to deliver the preferred distributions failure to comply with portfolio requirements breaches of certain covenants lowering of our senior debt rating below either baa3 by moody’s or bbb by standard  poor’s and a failed attempt to remarket the class a interests as a result of a breach of gmc’s obligations to assist in such remarketing in the event of a liquidation of gmc each member of gmc would receive the amount of its then current capital account balance the managing member may avoid liquidation in most circumstances by exercising an option to purchase the class a interests

the series b1 interests of gmc are entitled to receive quarterly preferred distributions at a fixed rate of 45 percent per year which is scheduled to be reset to a new fixed rate through a remarketing in october 2007 beginning in october 2007 the managing member of gmc may elect to repurchase the series b1 interests for an amount equal to the holder’s then current capital account balance plus any applicable makewhole amount gmc is not required to purchase the series b1 interests nor may these investors put these interests to us the series b1 interests will be exchanged for shares of our perpetual preferred stock upon the occurrence of any of the following events our senior unsecured debt rating falling below either ba3 as rated by moody’s or bb as rated by standard  poor’s or fitch inc 

  19

our bankruptcy or liquidation a default on any of our senior indebtedness resulting in an acceleration of indebtedness having an outstanding principal balance in excess of 50 million failing to pay a dividend on our common stock in any fiscal quarter or certain liquidating events if gmc fails to make a required distribution to the holders of series b1 interests when due we will be restricted from paying any dividend other than dividends in the form of shares of common stock or other distributions on shares of our common or preferred stock and may not repurchase or redeem shares of our common or preferred stock until all such accrued and undistributed distributions are paid to the holders of the series b1 interests

for financial reporting purposes the assets liabilities results of operations and cash flows of gmc and gm capital are included in our consolidated financial statements the thirdparty investors’ class a and series b1 interests in gmc and the preferred stock of gm capital are reflected as minority interests on our consolidated balance sheets and the return to the third party investors is reflected in interest expense net in the consolidated statements of earnings see note eight to the consolidated financial statements on pages 43 and 44 in item eight for more information regarding our minority interests

at may 28 2006 our cash and cash equivalents included 11 million in gmc and 21 million in gm capital that are restricted from use for our general corporate purposes pursuant to the terms of our agreements with thirdparty minority interest investors

in october 2004 we entered into a forward purchase contract under which we are obligated to deliver between approximately 14 million and 17 million shares of our common stock in october 2007 subject to adjustment under certain circumstances in exchange for 750 million of cash or in certain circumstances securities of an affiliate of the forward counterparty

the following table when reviewed in conjunction with the capital structure table above shows the composition of our debt structure including the impact of using derivative instruments

debt structure

 

commercial paper is a continuing source of shortterm financing we can issue commercial paper in the united states canada and europe our commercial paper borrowings are supported by 295 billion of feepaid committed credit lines and 335 million in uncommitted lines on october 21 2005 we entered into a new 11 billion 364day credit facility expiring in october 2006 and a new 11 billion fiveyear credit facility expiring in october 2010 these new facilities replaced our 11 billion credit facility that would have expired in january 2006 and our 750 million credit facility that would have expired in april 2006 we also have a 750 million fiveyear credit facility that will expire in january 2009 our credit facilities certain of our longterm debt agreements and our minority interests contain restrictive covenants at may 28 2006 we were in compliance with all of these covenants

the following table details the feepaid committed credit lines we had available as of may 28 2006

committed credit facilities 

 

we have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the sec covering the sale of debt securities common stock preference stock depository shares securities warrants purchase contracts purchase units and units as of may 28 2006 approximately 51 billion remained available under the shelf registration for future use

we believe that two important measures of financial strength are the ratio of fixed charge coverage and the ratio of operating cash flow defined as net cash provided by operating activities to debt defined as notes payable plus longterm debt including current portion our fixed charge coverage in fiscal 2006 was 46 compared to 47 in fiscal 2005 fiscal 2005 was favorably impacted by the gain on our disposition of our 405 percent equity interest in sve our operating cash flow to debt ratio increased to 29 percent in fiscal 2006 from 28 percent in fiscal 2005 currently standard and poor’s corporation has ratings of bbb on our publicly held longterm debt and a2 on our commercial paper moody’s investors services inc has ratings of baa2 for our longterm debt and p2 for our commercial paper fitch ratings inc rates our longterm debt bbb and our commercial paper f2 dominion bond rating service in canada currently rates general mills as alow these ratings are not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating

we also believe that growth in return on average capital is a key measure and it is used for management performance ratings return on average capital increased from 100 percent in 2005 to 106 percent in 2006 due to earnings growth and disciplined use of cash

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations

it is not our general business practice to enter into offbalance sheet arrangements nor is it our policy to issue 

  20

guarantees to third parties we have however issued guarantees and comfort letters of 171 million for the debt and other obligations of unconsolidated affiliates primarily for cpw in addition offbalance sheet arrangements are generally limited to the future payments under noncancelable operating leases which totaled 408 million at may 28 2006

at may 28 2006 we had invested in four variable interest entities vies we are the primary beneficiary pb of general mills capital inc gm capital a subsidiary that we consolidate as set forth in note eight to the consolidated financial statements appearing on pages 43 and 44 in item eight of this report we also have an interest in a contract manufacturer at our former facility in geneva illinois even though we are the pb we have not consolidated this entity because it is not material to our results of operations financial condition or liquidity at may 28 2006 this entity had property and equipment of 50 million and longterm debt of 50 million at may 28 2006 we are not the pb of the remaining two vies our maximum exposure to loss from these vies is limited to the 150 million minority interest in gm capital the contract manufacturer’s debt and our 6 million of equity investments in the two remaining vies

the following table summarizes our future estimated cash payments under existing contractual obligations including payments due by period the majority of the purchase obligations represent commitments for raw material and packaging to be utilized in the normal course of business and for consumerdirected marketing commitments that support our brands the net fair value of our interest rate and equity swaps was 159 million at may 28 2006 based on market values as of that date future changes in market values will impact the amount of cash ultimately paid or received to settle those instruments in the future other longterm obligations primarily consist of income taxes accrued compensation and benefits and miscellaneous liabilities we are unable to estimate the timing of the payments for these items we do not have significant statutory or contractual funding requirements for our definedbenefit retirement and other postretirement benefit plans further information on these plans including our expected contributions for fiscal 2007 is set forth in note thirteen to the consolidated financial statements appearing on pages 47 through 50 in item eight of this report

 

significant accounting estimates

for a complete description of our significant accounting policies please see note one to the consolidated financial statements appearing on pages 35 through 37 in item eight of this report our significant accounting estimates are those that have meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations these policies include our accounting for trade and consumer promotion activities goodwill and other intangible asset impairments income taxes and pension and other postretirement benefits

trade and consumer promotion activities

we report sales net of certain coupon and trade promotion costs the consumer coupon costs recorded as a reduction of sales are based on the estimated redemption value of those coupons as determined by historical patterns of coupon redemption and consideration of current market conditions such as competitive activity in those product categories the trade promotion costs include payments to customers to perform merchandising activities on our behalf such as advertising or instore displays discounts to our list prices to lower retail shelf prices and payments to gain distribution of new products the cost of these activities is recognized as the related revenue is recorded which generally precedes the actual cash expenditure the recognition of these costs requires estimation of customer participation and performance levels these estimates are made based on the quantity of customer sales the timing and forecasted costs of promotional activities and other factors differences between estimated expenses and actual costs are normally insignificant and are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period our accrued trade and consumer promotion liability was 339 million as of may 28 2006 and 283 million as of may 29 2005

our unit volume in the last week of each quarter is consistently higher than the average for the preceding weeks of the quarter in comparison to the average daily shipments in the first 12 weeks of a quarter the final week of each quarter has approximately two to four days’ worth of incremental shipments based on a fiveday week reflecting increased promotional activity at the end of the quarter this increased activity includes promotions to assure that our customers have sufficient inventory on hand to support major marketing events or increased seasonal demand early in the next quarter as well as promotions intended to help achieve interim unit volume targets if due to quarterend promotions or other reasons our customers purchase more product in any reporting period than endconsumer demand will require in future periods our sales level in future reporting periods could be adversely affected

  21

goodwill and other intangible asset impairments

goodwill represents the difference between the purchase prices of acquired companies and the related fair values of net assets acquired goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred impairment testing is performed for each of our reporting units we compare the carrying amount of goodwill for a reporting unit with its fair value and if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value an impairment has occurred

finite and indefinitelived intangible assets primarily brands are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable an impairment loss would be recognized when fair value is less than the carrying amount of the intangible

our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs from our annual longrange planning process we also make estimates of discount rates perpetuity growth assumptions and other factors we have completed our annual impairment testing and determined none of our goodwill or other intangible assets was impaired

income taxes

our consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and involves management judgment as to the ultimate resolution of any tax issues we accrue liabilities in current income taxes payable for potential assessments related to uncertain tax positions in a variety of taxing jurisdictions historically our assessments of the ultimate resolution of tax issues have been reasonably accurate the current open tax issues are not dissimilar in size or substance from historical items except for the accounting for losses recorded as part of the pillsbury transaction management currently believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters including the accounting for losses recorded as part of the pillsbury transaction will not have a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations or liquidity

pension and other postretirement benefits

we have definedbenefit retirement plans covering most us canadian and united kingdom employees benefits for salaried employees are based on length of service and final average compensation the hourly plans include various monthly amounts for each year of credited service our funding policy is consistent with the requirements of applicable laws our principal retirement plan covering domestic salaried employees has a provision that any excess pension assets would vest in plan participants if the plan is terminated within five years of a change in control

we also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to the majority of our us and canadian retirees the salaried health care benefit plan is contributory with retiree contributions based on years of service we fund related trusts for certain employees and retirees on an annual basis and made 95 million of voluntary contributions to these plans in fiscal 2006

actuarial assumptions we recognize benefits provided during retirement over the plan participants’ active working life accordingly we must use various actuarial assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement of our obligations actuarial assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our net periodic benefit expense or income and accumulated benefit obligations include the longterm rates of return on plan assets the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our benefit plans how we derive the marketrelated values of assets and the health care cost trend rates 

expected rate of return on plan assets our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation our historical longterm investment performance our estimate of future longterm returns by asset class using input from our actuaries investment services and investment managers and longterm inflation assumptions

the investment objective for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans is to secure the benefit obligations to participants at a reasonable cost to us the goal is to optimize the longterm return on plan assets at a moderate level of risk the pension and postretirement portfolios are broadly diversified across asset classes within asset classes the portfolios are further diversified across investment styles and investment organizations for the pension and other postretirement plans the longterm investment policy allocations are 30 percent to us equities 20 percent to international equities 10 percent to private equities 30 percent to fixed income and 10 percent to real assets real estate energy and timber the actual allocations to these asset classes may vary tactically around the longterm policy allocations based on relative market valuations

our historical investment returns compound annual growth rates were 16 percent 9 percent 11 percent 12 percent and 12 percent for the 1 5 10 15 and 20 year periods ended may 28 2006

for fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 we assumed a rate of return of 96 percent on our pension plan assets and our other postretirement plan assets

lowering the expected longterm rate of return on assets by 50 basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense for fiscal 2007 by approximately 18 million

  22

discount rates our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of the last day of our fiscal year for our pension and other postretirement obligations those same discount rates also are used to determine pension and other postretirement income and expense for the following fiscal year we work with our actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan participants and using highquality corporate bond yields to develop a forward interest rate curve including a margin to that index based on our credit risk this forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions the discount rates used in our pension and other postretirement assumptions were 555 percent and 55 percent respectively for the obligations as of may 29 2005 and for our fiscal 2006 income and expense and 665 percent for the obligations as of may 30 2004 and for our fiscal 2005 income and expense

lowering the discount rate by 50 basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense for fiscal 2007 by approximately 24 million

marketrelated value we base our determination of pension expense or income on a marketrelated valuation of assets which reduces yeartoyear volatility this marketrelated valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the marketrelated value of assets and the actual return based on the marketrelated value of assets since the marketrelated value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a fiveyear period the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded 

health care cost trend rates we review our health care trend rates annually our review is based on data and information we collect about our health care claims experience and information provided by our actuaries this information includes recent plan experience plan design overall industry experience and projections and assumptions used by other similar organizations our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with this review recent experiences and short term expectations our current health care cost trend rate assumption is 11 percent for retirees age 65 and over and 10 percent for retirees under age 65 these rates are graded down annually until the ultimate trend rate of 52 percent is reached in 2013 for retirees over age 65 and 2014 for retirees under age 65 the trend rates are applicable for calculations only if the retirees’ benefits increase as a result of health care inflation the ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually as necessary to approximate the current economic view on the rate of longterm inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium assumed trend rates for health care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for the postretirement benefit plans

if the health care cost trend rate increased by 1 percentage point in each future year the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of postretirement expense for fiscal 2007 would increase by 7 million and the postretirement accumulated benefit obligation as of may 28 2006 would increase by 90 million

financial statement impact in fiscal 2006 we recorded net pension and postretirement expense of 25 million compared to 6 million in fiscal 2005 and 5 million in fiscal 2004

as of may 28 2006 we had cumulative unrecognized actuarial net losses of 464 million on our pension plans and 317 million on our postretirement plans primarily as the result of decreases in our discount rate assumptions these unrecognized actuarial net losses will result in decreases in our future pension income and increases in postretirement expense since they currently exceed the corridors defined by gaap 

for our fiscal 2007 pension and other postretirement income and expense estimate we have increased the discount rate to 655 percent for our pension liabilities and 65 percent for our other postretirement liabilities based on interest rates and our credit spread as of may 28 2006 the expected rate of return on plan assets remains 96 percent actual future net pension and postretirement income or expense will depend on investment performance changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the populations participating in our pension and postretirement plans

recently issued accounting pronouncements

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 123revised “sharebased payment” sfas 123r which generally requires public companies to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grantdate fair value and to recognize this cost over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the standard is effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after june 15 2005 with several transition options regarding prospective versus retrospective application we will adopt sfas 123r in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 using the modified prospective method accordingly prior year results will not be restated but fiscal 2007 results will be presented as if we had applied the fair value method of accounting for stockbased compensation from the beginning of fiscal 1997 we currently expect the impact of adopting the fair value method of valuing stock awards to be approximately 011 to 012 per diluted share for fiscal 2007 however the actual impact on fiscal 2007 will be largely dependent 

  23

on the particular structure of stockbased awards granted during fiscal 2007 and various market factors that affect the fair value of awards we are evaluating whether to allocate these costs to our operating segments sfas 123r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow as currently required thereby reducing net operating cash flows and increasing net financing cash flows in periods following adoption while those amounts cannot be estimated for future periods the amount of operating cash flows generated in prior periods for such excess tax deductions was 41 million for fiscal 2006 62 million for fiscal 2005 and 63 million for fiscal 2004 see note one to the consolidated financial statements on pages 35 through 37 in item eight of this report

in november 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 151 “inventory costs – an amendment of arb no 43 chapter 4” sfas no 151 clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and wasted material spoilage sfas no 151 is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 we do not expect sfas no 151 to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition

in june 2006 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” fin 48 fin 48 clarifies when tax benefits should be recorded in financial statements requires certain disclosures of uncertain tax matters and indicates how any tax reserves should be classified in a balance sheet fin 48 is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 we are evaluating the impact of fin 48 on our results of operations and financial condition

nongaap measures

we have included in this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations measures of financial performance that are not defined by gaap for each of these nongaap financial measures we are providing below a reconciliation of the differences between the nongaap measure and the most directly comparable gaap measure an explanation of why our management believes the nongaap measure provides useful information to investors and any additional purposes for which our management or board of directors uses the nongaap measure these nongaap measures should be viewed in addition to and not in lieu of the comparable gaap measure fiscal years prior to 2004 are presented in support of our discussion of these measures outside of this annual report on form 10k

diluted eps excluding the effects of our convertible debentures and the net benefit of gains on divestitures and debt repurchase costs 

this nongaap measure is used in internal management reporting and as a component of the board of directors’ rating of our performance for management and employee incentive compensation management and the board of directors believe that this measure provides useful information to investors as it eliminates the effects of infrequently occurring events thereby improving the comparability of yeartoyear results of operations

 

  24

total segment operating profit 

this nongaap measure is used in internal management reporting and as a component of the board of directors’ rating of our performance for management and employee incentive compensation management and the board of directors believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is the profitability measure we use to evaluate segment performance operating profit for the reportable segments and total segment operating profit exclude unallocated corporate items net interest restructuring and other exit costs gains on divestitures debt repurchase costs income taxes and aftertax earnings from joint ventures as these items are centrally managed at the corporate level see note sixteen to the consolidated financial statements on pages 51 and 52 in item eight of this report for a reconciliation of segment operating profits and net earnings

 

return on average total capital 

this nongaap measure is used in internal management reporting and as a component of the board of directors’ rating of our performance for management and employee incentive compensation management and the board of directors believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is important for assessing the utilization of capital and it eliminates the effects of infrequently occurring events thereby improving the yeartoyear comparability

 

  25

change in net sales excluding the effect of the 53 rd week 

our fiscal year ends on the last sunday of may while our typical fiscal year includes 52 weeks every 5 or 6 years our fiscal year includes a 53 rd week as it did in the fiscal year ended may 30 2004 that 53 rd week impacts the comparability of annual results to view our results on a comparable basis we have provided net sales growth information on a comparable 52week basis the effect of the 53 rd week was determined using onefifth of the values of the fiveweek month of may 2004

 

ongoing joint ventures 

our interest in sve was redeemed in february 2005 to view the performance of our joint ventures on an ongoing basis we have provided certain information excluding sve

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

we are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates commodity prices and equity prices changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows in the normal course of business we actively manage our exposure to these market risks by entering into various hedging transactions authorized under our policies that place clear controls on these activities the counterparties in these transactions are generally highly rated institutions we establish credit limits for each counterparty our hedging transactions include but are not limited to a variety of derivative financial instruments

interest rates we manage our debt structure and our interest rate risk through the use of fixed and floatingrate debt and derivatives we use interest rate swaps and forwardstarting interest rate swaps to hedge our exposure to interest rate changes and to reduce volatility of our financing costs generally under these swaps we agree with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixedrate and floatingrate interest amounts based on an agreed notional principal amount our primary exposure is to us interest rates as of may 28 2006 we had 70 billion of aggregate notional principal amount the principal amount on which the fixed or floating interest rate is calculated outstanding this includes notional amounts of offsetting swaps that neutralize our exposure to interest rates on other interest rate swaps see note six to the consolidated financial statements on pages 40 through 42 in item eight of this report

foreign currency rates foreign currency fluctuations can affect our net investments and earnings denominated in foreign currencies we primarily use foreign currency forward contracts and option contracts to selectively hedge our cash flow exposure to changes in exchange rates these contracts function as hedges since they change in value inversely to the change created in the underlying exposure as foreign exchange rates fluctuate our primary us dollar exchange rate exposures are with the canadian dollar the euro the australian dollar the mexican peso and the british pound

commodities many commodities we use in the production and distribution of our products are exposed to market price risks we manage this market risk through an integrated set of financial instruments including purchase orders noncancelable contracts futures contracts options and swaps our primary commodity price exposures are to cereal grains sugar dairy products vegetables fruits meats vegetable oils and other agricultural products as well as paper and plastic packaging materials operating supplies and energy

equity instruments equity price movements affect our compensation expense as certain investments owned by our employees are revalued we use equity swaps to manage this market risk

value at risk these estimates are intended to measure the maximum potential fair value we could lose in one day from adverse changes in market interest rates foreign exchange rates commodity prices or equity prices under normal market conditions a monte carlo var methodology was used to quantify the market risk for our exposures the models assumed normal market conditions and used a 95 percent confidence level

the var calculation used historical interest rates foreign exchange rates and commodity and equity prices from the past year to estimate the potential volatility and correlation of these rates in the future the market data were drawn from the riskmetrics tm data set the calculations are not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that we expect to incur further since the hedging instrument the derivative inversely correlates with the underlying exposure we would expect that any loss or gain in the fair value of our derivatives would be generally offset by an increase or decrease in the fair value of the underlying exposures the positions included in the calculations were debt investments interest rate swaps foreign exchange forwards commodity swaps futures and options and equity instruments the calculations do not include the underlying foreign exchange and commoditiesrelated positions that are hedged by these marketrisksensitive instruments

the table below presents the estimated maximum potential oneday loss in fair value for our interest rate foreign currency commodity and equity marketrisksensitive instruments outstanding on may 28 2006 and may 29 2005 and the average amount outstanding during the year ended may 28 2006 the amounts were calculated using the var methodology described above

these matters involve several different actions including litigation initiated by governmental authorities andor private parties administrative proceedings commenced by regulatory agencies and demand letters by regulatory agencies andor private parties of the 12 matters in the table above we are a party to current litigation related to one cleanup site

 we recognize that our potential exposure with respect to any of these sites may be joint and several but have concluded that our probable aggregate exposure is not material this conclusion is based upon among other things our payments andor accruals with respect to each site the number ranking and financial strength of other potentially responsible parties identified at each of the sites the status of the proceedings including various settlement agreements consent decrees or court orders allocations of volumetric waste contributions and allocations of relative responsibility among potentially responsible parties developed by regulatory agencies and by private parties remediation cost estimates prepared by governmental authorities or private technical consultants and our historical experience in negotiating and settling disputes with respect to similar sites

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

executive overview

we are a global consumer foods company we develop differentiated food products and market these valueadded products under unique brand names we work continuously on product innovation to improve our established brands and to create new products that meet consumers’ evolving needs and preferences in addition we build the equity of our brands over time with strong consumerdirected marketing and innovative merchandising we believe our brandbuilding strategy is the key to winning and sustaining leading share positions in markets around the globe

our businesses are organized into three segments our us retail segment accounted for approximately 69 percent of our fiscal 2005 net sales and reflects business with a wide variety of grocery stores specialty stores drug dollar and discount chains and mass merchandisers operating throughout the united states our major product categories in this business segment are readytoeat cereals meals refrigerated and frozen dough products baking products snacks yogurt and organic foods our bakeries and foodservice segment generated approximately 16 percent of fiscal 2005 net sales this business segment consists of products marketed to retail and wholesale bakeries to commercial and noncommercial foodservice distributors and operators and to convenience stores throughout the united states and canada the remaining 15 percent of our fiscal 2005 net sales was generated by our consolidated international businesses these include a retail business in canada that largely mirrors our us retail product mix along with retail and foodservice businesses competing in key markets in europe latin america and the asiapacific region in addition to these consolidated operations we participate in several joint ventures we record our proportionate share of aftertax earnings or losses from these ventures

our fundamental business goal is to generate superior returns for our stockholders over the long term by delivering growth in sales and earnings while improving return on capital coupled with an attractive dividend yield in the most recent fiscal year general mills’ total return to stockholders was 11 percent while the sp 500 index returned 9 percent from fiscal 2000 to 2005 general mills’ total return to stockholders averaged 7 percent while the sp 500 index posted a negative 1 percent average annual return over this period

for the fiscal year ended may 29 2005 our net sales grew 2 percent and diluted earnings per share grew 18 percent including the benefit of gains on divestitures details of our financial results are provided in the “results of operations” section below our cash flow in 2005 was strong enabling us to increase our dividend payments continue to make significant fixed asset investments to support future growth and productivity and reduce our total debt by 20 billion

results for fiscal 2005 were limited by two principal factors first higher commodity costs led to a reduction in our gross margin second we increased list andor targeted promoted prices in several categories in order to partially offset the higher commodity costs in some instances price gaps developed versus competitors and we subsequently increased trade promotion costs in order to remain competitive this was particularly true for promoted prices in the cereal category where the price gap led to reduced volume and profit for the big g cereal division however slight profit growth in our bakeries and foodservice segment was encouraging as was the continued success of our international expansion plans

as we begin fiscal 2006 we are encouraged by the momentum in several of our key businesses sustaining that momentum and restoring growth in our us cereal business will be key to achieving our targeted results in 2006 in addition we must renew good earnings growth in our bakeries and foodservice segment we face several challenges that will hinder earnings growth in the year ahead commodity prices continue to rise although not as quickly as they did in 2005 and energy costs and our salary and benefit expense are expected to be higher these increasing costs will negatively impact our margins therefore in order for our plan to be successful we must restore growth in our margin rate to offset the increasing costs and grow margins our plans call for continued realization of price increases we announced in fiscal 2005 combined with productivity savings through supply chain and administrative costsaving efforts

we believe the key driver of our success in 2006 will be operating profit growth which will be driven by product innovation and net sales growth our business plans include new product activity and innovations that respond to consumers’ interest in health and nutrition convenience and new flavor varieties

results of operations — 2005 vs 2004

our net sales for fiscal 2005 were 112 billion an increase of 2 percent for the year compared to sales in fiscal 2004 excluding the effect of the 53rd week in 2004 net sales increased 3 percent the components of net sales growth are shown in the following table

 

the unit volume growth in fiscal 2005 contributed approximately 17 million in gross margin improvement net sales less cost of sales over fiscal 2004 however overall gross margin decreased by 77 million primarily due to increased cost of sales driven primarily by approximately 170 million in commodity cost increases as a result gross margin as a percent of net sales decreased 130 basis points versus fiscal 2004 to 39 percent in fiscal 2005

selling general and administrative costs decreased by 25 million from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 primarily driven by four factors a 54 million decrease in consumer marketing expense a 37 million increase in distribution costs a 32 million increase in unallocated corporate items and a 34 million decrease in mergerrelated costs these mergerrelated costs were items related to the planning and execution of the integration of pillsbury

net interest expense decreased 10 percent from 508 million in fiscal 2004 to 455 million in fiscal 2005 primarily due to reduction of debt levels interest expense includes preferred distributions paid on subsidiary minority interests we have in place a net amount of interest rate swaps that convert 645 million of fixedrate debt to floating rates taking into account the effect of our interest rate swaps the average interest rate on our total outstanding debt and subsidiary minority interests was 54 percent

restructuring and other exit costs were 84 million in fiscal 2005 these charges were primarily associated with the supply chain initiatives to further increase asset utilization and reduce manufacturing and sourcing costs the actions included plant closures and production realignment resulting in asset writedowns severance and related costs our fiscal 2004 results included restructuring and other exit costs of 26 million

we recorded a gain of 499 million on two divestitures in fiscal 2005 on february 28 2005 snack ventures europe sve our snacks joint venture with pepsico inc was terminated and our 405 percent interest was redeemed on april 4 2005 we sold our lloyd’s barbecue business to hormel foods corporation we received 799 million in cash proceeds from these dispositions and the proceeds were used to repurchase debt in fiscal 2005 we earned 28 million after tax from sve and lloyd’s

we incurred 137 million in debt repurchase costs in fiscal 2005 resulting from the repurchase of 760 million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 6 notes due in 2012 the costs consisted of 73 million of noncash interest rate swap losses reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income 59 million of purchase premium and 5 million of noncash unamortized cost of issuance expense

in fiscal 2005 our effective income tax rate increased to 366 percent driven primarily by the tax impacts of our fiscal 2005 divestitures the higher book tax expense related to the fiscal 2005 divestitures did not result in the payment of significant cash taxes our effective income tax rate was 35 percent in fiscal 2004 we expect our effective tax rate in fiscal 2006 to be approximately 355 percent

aftertax earnings from joint venture operations grew 20 percent to reach 89 million in fiscal 2005 compared with 74 million reported a year earlier this increase was primarily due to unit volume gains by our continuing joint ventures as of may 29 2005 we were a 50 percent partner in several joint ventures our international joint ventures include cereal partners worldwide cpw our joint venture with nestlé and häagendazs joint ventures in asia 8 th continent is our domestic joint venture with dupont to develop and market soy beverages on february 28 2005 we announced the redemption of our 405 percent share of sve as described above

our results of operations reflect the adoption of emerging issues task force issue no 04–8 eitf 04–8 “the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share” the effect of eitf 048 reduced our fiscal 2005 diluted earnings per share by 019 and 

reduced previously reported diluted earnings per share by 015 and 008 for fiscal 2004 and 2003 respectively related to our contingently convertible debt issued in 2002

average diluted shares outstanding were 409 million in fiscal 2005 down 1 percent from 413 million in fiscal 2004 as the repurchase of 17 million shares from diageo was partially offset by stock option exercises

net income increased to 124 billion in fiscal 2005 from 106 billion in 2004 earnings per diluted share of 308 in 2005 were up 18 percent from 260 in 2004 primarily due to the redemption of our sve interest the sale of lloyd’s and the reduction in interest expense

operating segment results

us retail segment

net sales for our us retail operations totaled 778 billion in fiscal 2005 compared to 776 billion in fiscal 2004 the components of the change in net sales are shown in the following table

 

unit volume grew 1 percent versus fiscal 2004 excluding the prior year’s extra week unit volume grew 3 percent all of our us retail divisions with the exception of big g cereals experienced volume growth for the year

 

big g cereal volume fell 5 percent in fiscal 2005 with contributions from new products including reducedsugar versions of cinnamon toast crunch  trix and cocoa puffs more than offset by the loss of volume associated with the increases in list andor promoted prices yoplait yogurt volume increased 11 percent with continued growth from established cup yogurt lines snacks division volume was up 2 percent led by the introduction of new nature valley granola bar products meals division unit volume rose 1 percent with growth in our progresso  hamburger helper and old el paso businesses unit volume growth of 1 percent for pillsbury usa reflected gains for refrigerated cookies and bread and totino’s pizza and hot snacks baking products division unit volume was up 1 percent behind growth in mass merchandising channels

retail dollar sales for our major brands grew 2 percent overall on a 52 versus 52week basis as measured by acnielsen including panel projections for walmart

 

the unit volume growth in fiscal 2005 contributed approximately 13 million in gross margin improvement over fiscal 2004 but overall gross margin decreased by 144 million cost of sales increased by 161 million driven primarily by commodity cost increases and net pricing realization defined as the impact of list and promoted price increases net of increases in trade promotion costs did not contribute to offset those increased costs gross margin as a percent of net sales decreased 200 basis points versus fiscal 2004 to 43 percent in fiscal 2005

selling general and administrative costs decreased by 54 million primarily due to decreases in consumer marketing spending

operating profits declined to 172 billion down from 181 billion in fiscal 2004

bakeries and foodservice segment

net sales for our bakeries and foodservice operations decreased slightly to 174 billion in fiscal 2005 compared to 176 billion in fiscal 2004 the components of the change in net sales are shown in the following table

 

unit volume was down 5 percent or down 3 percent on a comparable 52week basis reflecting softness in shipments to our foodservice distributors and bakery customers that was partially offset by growth in sales to convenience stores unit volume by major customer category was

 

the unit volume decline in fiscal 2005 reduced gross margin by approximately 22 million compared to fiscal 2004 however overall gross margin increased by 5 million as an increase in cost of sales was offset by positive net pricing realization gross margin as a percent of net sales increased slightly versus fiscal 2004 to 26 percent in fiscal 2005

selling general and administrative costs increased by only 3 million

operating profits increased from 132 million in fiscal 2004 to 134 million in fiscal 2005

international segment

net sales for our international operations totaled 172 billion in fiscal 2005 compared to 155 billion in 2004 the components of net sales growth are shown in the following table

 

unit volume grew 5 percent for the year and comparable 52week volume was up 6 percent international unit volume growth was driven by 12 percent growth in the asiapacific region

 

using constant exchange rates to translate components of earnings the unit volume increase in fiscal 2005 improved gross margin by approximately 27 million overall gross margin increased by 52 million as net price realization more than offset increases in cost of sales gross margin as a percent of sales improved to 35 percent selling general and administrative costs increased 10 million and operating profit increased 42 million or 35 percent over fiscal 2004

operating profits including the favorable effects of foreign currency rate changes grew to 171 million 44 percent above last year’s 119 million

unallocated corporate items

unallocated corporate items were 32 million in expense in fiscal 2005 including 18 million in costs classified as cost of sales associated with restructuring and other exit activities fiscal 2004 expense was 17 million including mergerrelated costs of 34 million the primary factors accounting for the remaining variance were severance costs of 21 million in fiscal 2005 that were not associated with restructuring and other exit activities and an increase of 9 million in stockbased compensation expense

joint ventures

our share of aftertax joint venture earnings increased from 74 million in fiscal 2004 to 89 million in fiscal 2005 primarily due to unit volume gains in our continuing ventures as follows

 

our interest in sve was redeemed in february 2005 and therefore is excluded from the table above

our joint ventures do not share our fiscal year and therefore did not have the benefit of a 53rd week in fiscal 2004

results of operations — 2004 vs 2003

net earnings for the 53week fiscal 2004 were 106 billion up 15 percent from fiscal 2003 diluted earnings per share were 260 compared to 235 in fiscal 2003 as adjusted for the effects of eitf 048 annual net sales rose 5 percent to 111 billion driven by a 3 percent increase in worldwide unit volume and a 2 percent increase in net price realization including foreign exchange excluding the effect of the 53rd week net sales increased 4 percent this performance reflected improvement in our us retail and international segments but was constrained by economic and internal factors limiting growth in our bakeries and foodservice segment

us retail unit volume grew 4 percent in fiscal 2004 or 2 percent excluding the 53rd week all of our us retail divisions experienced volume growth fueled by an increase in product and marketing innovation net sales 

for these operations totaled 776 billion in fiscal 2004 compared to 741 billion in fiscal 2003 operating profits totaled 181 billion up 3 percent from 175 billion in the prior year

bakeries and foodservice results in fiscal 2004 included a unit volume decline of 3 percent or 4 percent excluding the extra week reflecting softness in our bakery business and elimination of lowmargin product lines net sales fell slightly to 176 billion in fiscal 2004 compared to 180 billion in fiscal 2003 while operating profit declined 15 percent from 156 million in fiscal 2003 to 132 million in fiscal 2004

international unit volume increased 5 percent in fiscal 2004 or 4 percent excluding the extra week driven by growth in the asiapacific region canada and europe net sales totaled 155 billion in fiscal 2004 compared to 130 billion in 2003 and operating profits grew to 119 million up 31 percent from the prior year’s 91 million total

unallocated corporate items decreased from 76 million in fiscal 2003 to 17 million in fiscal 2004 primarily driven by a 36 million decrease in mergerrelated costs as the integration of pillsbury was completed during the year

our share of aftertax joint venture earnings increased from 61 million in fiscal 2003 to 74 million in fiscal 2004 primarily due to unit volume gains

impact of inflation

it is our view that changes in the general rate of inflation have not had a significant effect on profitability over the three most recent years other than as noted above related to commodities we attempt to minimize the effects of inflation through appropriate planning and operating practices our risk management practices are discussed in the “market risk management” section below

cash flows

sources and uses of cash in the past three years are shown in the following table over the most recent threeyear period general mills’ operations have generated 48 billion in cash in fiscal 2005 cash flow from operations totaled over 17 billion that was up from the previous year due primarily to the change in current assets and liabilities included in cash flows from operations providing 258 million cash in 2005 versus using 186 million cash in 2004 the fiscal 2005 source of cash was due primarily to an increase in accrued taxes as the result of receiving cash benefits from the utilization of capital losses for tax purposes the fiscal 2004 use of cash was primarily due to lower accrued liabilities payments against integration and restructuring liabilities and changes in accrued taxes

 

in fiscal 2005 capital investment for land buildings equipment and intangibles decreased to 434 million from 653 million in fiscal 2004 we expect capital expenditures of approximately 450 million in fiscal 2006

dividends in 2005 totaled 124 per share a payout of 40 percent of diluted earnings per share or 48 percent of diluted earnings per share excluding the net gain from divestitures and debt repurchases our board of directors announced a 6 percent dividend increase to an annual rate of 132 per share effective with the dividend payable on august 1 2005

the decrease in outstanding debt in fiscal 2005 includes the results of debt repurchases on march 23 2005 we commenced a cash tender offer for our outstanding 6 notes due in 2012 the tender offer resulted in the purchase of 500 million principal amount 

of the notes subsequent to the expiration of the tender offer we purchased an additional 260 million principal amount of the notes in the open market the aggregate purchases resulted in the debt repurchase costs described earlier in the “results of operations – 2005 vs 2004” section

in may 2002 a wholly owned subsidiary of general mills sold 150000 class a preferred membership interests in general mills cereals llc gmc to an unrelated thirdparty investor in exchange for 150 million on october 8 2004 a wholly owned subsidiary of general mills sold 835000 series b1 preferred membership interests in gmc in exchange for 835 million currently all interests in gmc other than the aforementioned interests but including all managing member interests are held by wholly owned subsidiaries of general mills we used 750 million of the proceeds from the sale of gmc series b1 interests to purchase approximately 17 million shares of our common stock from diageo plc at 4520 per share in october 2004 this share repurchase was made in conjunction with diageo’s sale of approximately 33 million additional shares of general mills common stock in an underwritten public offering following these transactions diageo and its affiliates held approximately 29 million shares of general mills common stock

concurrently in october 2004 lehman brothers holdings inc issued 750 million of notes which are mandatorily exchangeable for general mills common stock in connection with the issuance of those notes an affiliate of lehman brothers entered into a forward purchase contract with general mills under which we are obligated to deliver to such affiliate between approximately 14 million and 17 million shares of general mills common stock subject to adjustment under certain circumstances these shares will generally be deliverable by us in october 2007 in exchange for 750 million in cash or in certain circumstances securities of an affiliate of lehman brothers we recorded a 43 million fee for this forward purchase contract as an adjustment to stockholders’ equity

with respect to the holders of minority interests in gmc the series b1 interests will be exchanged for shares of our perpetual preferred stock upon the occurrence of certain events including a decrease in our longterm debt rating below either ba3 as rated by moody’s or bb as rated by standard  poor’s or fitch inc or a failure to pay a quarterly dividend on our common stock in addition if gmc fails to make certain required distributions we will be restricted from paying any dividend other than dividends in the form of shares of common stock or other distributions on shares of our common stock and may not repurchase or redeem shares of our common stock until such distributions are paid the class a interests have the right to request the dissolution and liquidation of gmc upon the occurrence of certain events including the bankruptcy of gmc or its subsidiaries failure to deliver the preferred distributions failure to comply with portfolio requirements breaches of certain covenants lowering of our senior debt rating below either baa3 by moody’s or bbb by standard  poor’s and a failed attempt to remarket the class a interests as a result of a breach of gmc’s obligations to assist in such remarketing in the event of a liquidation of gmc each member of gmc would receive the amount of its then capital account balance the managing member may avoid liquidation in most circumstances by exercising an option to purchase the class a interests an election to purchase the preferred membership interests could impact our liquidity by requiring us to refinance the purchase price

our board of directors has authorized the repurchase from time to time of shares of our common stock subject to a maximum of 170 million shares held in our treasury we did not repurchase a significant number of our shares on the open market in fiscal 2005 with the completion of our 2 billion debt reduction plan in fiscal 2005 we intend to resume openmarket share repurchases in fiscal 2006

financial condition

our total debt was 62 billion as of may 29 2005 a decrease of 20 billion from may 30 2004 we also consider our leases and deferred income taxes related to tax leases as part of our debt structure and include them in our measurement of “adjusted debt plus certain minority interests” as shown in the table below in fiscal 2005 our adjusted debt plus certain minority interests declined by 17 billion to 67 billion and our stockholders’ equity grew to 57 billion the market value of our stockholders’ equity increased as well as an increase in share price was partially offset by a decrease in shares outstanding as of may 29 2005 our equity market capitalization was 183 billion based on a price of 4968 per share and 369 million basic shares 

outstanding our total market capitalization including adjusted debt minority interests and equity capital was 258 billion as of may 29 2005 down slightly from the total as of may 30 2004

  

at the end of fiscal 2005 approximately 68 percent of our adjusted debt plus certain minority interests was longterm this includes classifying the zero coupon convertible debentures as shortterm due to put provisions exercisable in october 2005

we consider our leases and deferred income taxes related to tax leases as part of our fixedrate obligations the following table when reviewed in conjunction with the capital structure table shows the composition of our debt structure including the impact of using derivative instruments

 

commercial paper is a continuing source of shortterm financing we can issue commercial paper in the united states canada and europe through a program established in fiscal 1999 our commercial paper borrowings are supported by 185 billion in committed credit lines currently we have no outstanding borrowings under these credit lines the following table details the feepaid credit lines we had available as of may 29 2005

 

on june 23 2004 we filed a universal shelf registration statement the shelf with the sec covering the sale of up to 59 billion of debt securities common stock preference stock depository shares securities warrants purchase contracts purchase units and units all described in the shelf in addition the shelf covered the resale of approximately 50 million shares of our common stock owned by an affiliate of diageo plc which was completed in october 2004 as described in the “cash flows” section above the sec declared the shelf effective on september 20 2004 as of may 29 2005 

approximately 51 billion remained available under the shelf for future use

we believe that two important measures of financial strength are the ratios of fixed charge coverage and cash flows from operations to adjusted debt plus certain minority interests our fixed charge coverage in fiscal 2005 was 47 times compared to 38 times in fiscal 2004 and cash flows from operations to adjusted debt plus certain minority interests increased to 26 percent we expect to pay down between 100 and 200 million of adjusted debt plus certain minority interests in fiscal 2006 our goal is to return to a mid singlea rating for our longterm debt and to the top tier shortterm rating that we held prior to our announcement of the pillsbury acquisition currently standard and poor’s corporation has ratings of bbb on our publicly held longterm debt and a2 on our commercial paper moody’s investors services inc has ratings of baa2 for our longterm debt and p2 for our commercial paper fitch ratings inc rates our longterm debt bbb and our commercial paper f2 dominion bond rating service in canada currently rates general mills as alow

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations

it is not our general business practice to enter into offbalance sheet arrangements nor is it our policy to issue guarantees to third parties we have however issued guarantees of approximately 168 million for the debt and other obligations of unconsolidated affiliates primarily cpw in addition offbalance sheet arrangements are generally limited to the future payments under noncancelable operating leases which totaled approximately 462 million at may 29 2005

the following table summarizes our future estimated cash payments under existing contractual obligations including payments due by period the majority of the purchase obligations represent commitments for projected raw material and packaging needs to be utilized in the normal course of business and for consumerdirected marketing commitments that support our brands the fair value of our interest rate swaps was 221 million at may 29 2005 based on interest rates as of that date future changes in interest rates will impact the amount of cash ultimately paid or received to settle those liabilities in the future other longterm obligations primarily consist of income taxes accrued compensation and benefits miscellaneous liabilities and minority interests we are unable to estimate the timing of the payments for these items we do not have significant statutory or contractual funding requirements for our definedbenefit retirement and other postretirement benefit plans further information on these plans including our expected contributions for fiscal 2006 is set forth in note fourteen to the consolidated financial statements appearing on pages 47 through 51 in item eight of this report

  

if holders of the zero coupon convertible debentures exercise their rights to require us to repurchase the notes in october 2005 we intend to refinance that obligation using sources of financing discussed previously

critical accounting policies

for a complete description of our significant accounting policies please see note one to the consolidated financial statements appearing on pages 31 through 34 in item eight of this report our critical accounting policies are those that have meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results and that may require significant management judgment and estimates these policies include our accounting for trade and consumer promotion activities asset impairments income taxes and pension and postretirement liabilities

trade and consumer promotion activities

we report sales net of certain coupon and trade promotion costs the trade promotion costs include payments to customers to perform merchandising activities on our behalf such as advertising or instore displays discounts 

to our list prices to lower retail shelf prices and payments to gain distribution of new products

the amount and timing of expense recognition for trade and consumer promotion activities involve management judgment related to estimated participation and performance levels the vast majority of yearend liabilities associated with these activities are resolved within the following fiscal year and therefore do not require highly uncertain longterm estimates for interim reporting we estimate the annual trade promotion expense and recognize pro rata period expense generally in proportion to revenue adjusted for estimated yeartodate expenditures if greater than the pro rata amount certain trade and consumer promotion expenses are recorded as reductions of net sales

promotional funds for our retail businesses are initially established at the beginning of each year and paid out over the course of the year based on the customer’s performance of agreedupon merchandising activity during the year additional funds may also be used in response to competitive activities as a result of changes in the mix of our marketing support or to help achieve interim unit volume targets

we set annual sales objectives and interim targets as a regular practice to manage our business our sales employees are salaried and are eligible for annual cash incentives based on performance against objectives including goals for unit volume and the trade promotion cost per unit required to achieve the unit volume goal our sales employees have discretion to plan and adjust the timing of merchandising activity over the course of the year and they also have some discretion to adjust the level of trade promotion funding applied to a particular event

our unit volume in the last week of each quarter is consistently higher than the average for the preceding weeks of the quarter in comparison to the average daily shipments in the first 12 weeks of a quarter the final week of each quarter has approximately two to four days’ worth of incremental shipments based on a fiveday week reflecting increased promotional activity at the end of the quarter this increased activity includes promotions to assure that our customers have sufficient inventory on hand to support major marketing events or increased seasonal demand early in the next quarter as well as promotions intended to help achieve interim unit volume targets this increased sales activity results in shipments that are in direct response to orders from customers or authorized pursuant to prearranged inventorymanagement agreements and accordingly are recognized as revenue within that quarter the two to four day range of increased unit volume in the last week of each quarter has been generally consistent from quarter to quarter over the last three years except that in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 we were slightly below the two to four day range primarily as actions to raise promoted prices on big g cereals resulted in declines in promoted volume if incremental shipments had been within the two to four day range our reported us retail volume growth for the quarter would have remained unchanged

as part of our effort to assess the results of our promotional activities we regularly estimate the amount of “retailer inventory” in the system — defined as product that we have shipped to our customers that has not yet been purchased from our customers by the endconsumer while it is not possible for us to measure the absolute level of inventory we are able to estimate the change that occurs each month by comparing our shipments to retail customers with their sales to endconsumers as reported by acnielsen our estimate indicates inventory levels peak in november when retailers have increased inventories to meet seasonal demand for products like refrigerated dough and readytoserve soup this seasonal trend is generally consistent from year to year even as retailers have taken actions to reduce their ongoing inventory levels

we also assess the effectiveness of our promotional activities by evaluating the endconsumer purchases of our products subsequent to the reporting period if due to quarterend promotions or other reasons our customers purchase more product in any reporting period than endconsumer demand will require in future periods then our sales level in future reporting periods would be adversely affected

as part of our ongoing evaluation of sales we also monitor customer returns we generally do not allow a right of return on our products however on a limited casebycase basis with prior approval we may allow customers to return products in saleable condition for redistribution to other customers or outlets these returns are recorded as reductions of net sales in the period of the return monthly returns are consistently below 1 percent of sales and have averaged approximately 05 percent of total monthly shipments over the last three years

asset impairments

we are required to evaluate our longlived assets including goodwill for impairment and write down the value of any assets when they are determined to be impaired evaluating the impairment of longlived assets involves management judgment in estimating the fair values and future cash flows related to these assets although the predictability of longterm cash flows may be uncertain our evaluations indicate fair values for our longlived assets and goodwill that are significantly in excess of stated book values therefore we believe the risk of unrecognized impairment is low

income taxes

income tax expense involves management judgment as to the ultimate resolution of any tax issues historically our assessments of the ultimate resolution of tax issues have been reasonably accurate the current open tax issues are not dissimilar in size or substance from historical items except for the accounting for losses recorded as part of the pillsbury transaction the finalization of the tax benefits related to these losses would be accounted for as a reduction of goodwill

pension accounting

the accounting for pension and other postretirement liabilities requires the estimation of several critical factors key assumptions that determine this liability and related income or expense include the discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets

our discount rate assumption is determined annually based on the interest rate for longterm highquality corporate bonds using yields for maturities that match the expected benefit obligations the discount rate used to determine the pension and other postretirement obligations as of the balance sheet date is the rate in effect as of that measurement date that same discount rate also is used to determine pension and other postretirement expense for the following fiscal year

our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation our historical longterm investment performance our estimate of future longterm returns by asset class using input from our actuaries investment services and investment managers and longterm inflation assumptions our historical investment performance compound annual growth rates are 18 7 11 11 12 and 13 for the 1 5 10 15 20 and 30 year periods ended may 29 2005

in addition to our assumptions about the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets we base our determination of pension expense or income on a marketrelated valuation of assets which reduces yeartoyear volatility in accordance with sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” this marketrelated valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the marketrelated value of assets and the actual return based on the marketrelated value of assets since the marketrelated value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a fiveyear period the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded as of may 29 2005 we had cumulative unrecognized actuarial net losses of approximately 993 million on our pension plans and 393 million on our postretirement plans primarily as the result of decreases in our discount rate assumptions these unrecognized actuarial net losses will result in decreases in our future pension income and increases in postretirement expense since they currently exceed the corridors defined by sfas no 87 and sfas no 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions”

in fiscal 2005 we recorded net pension and postretirement expense of 6 million compared to 5 million in fiscal 2004 the discount rates used in our pension and other postretirement assumptions were 60 percent for the obligation as of may 25 2003 and for our fiscal 2004 income and expense and 665 percent for the obligation as of may 30 2004 and for our fiscal 2005 income and expense for fiscal 2004 and 2005 we assumed a rate of return of 96 percent on our pension plan assets and our other postretirement plan assets

for our fiscal 2006 pension and other postretirement income and expense estimate we have reduced the discount rate to 555 percent for our pension liabilities and 550 percent for our postretirement liabilities based on interest rates as of may 29 2005 the expected rate of return on plan assets remains 96 percent actual future net pension and postretirement income or expense will depend on investment performance 

changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the populations participating in our pension and postretirement plans

lowering the expected longterm rate of return on assets by 50 basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense for fiscal 2006 by approximately 18 million lowering the discount rate by 50 basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense for fiscal 2006 by approximately 24 million

new accounting rules

the fasb issued sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” in december 2004 which will require the cost of employee compensation paid with equity instruments to be measured based on grantdate fair values and recognized over the vesting period in april 2005 the securities and exchange commission announced the adoption of a new rule that amends the compliance dates for sfas no 123r the new rule allows companies to implement sfas no 123r at the beginning of their fiscal year that begins after june 15 2005 under the new rule sfas no 123r will become effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 we are still evaluating the impact of adopting sfas 123r on our consolidated financial statements

in november 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 151 “inventory costs – an amendment of arb no 43 chapter 4” sfas no 151 clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and wasted material spoilage sfas no 151 is effective for the fiscal year beginning after june 15 2005 and is effective for us in fiscal 2007 we do not expect sfas no 151 to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 153 “exchanges of nonmonetary assets – an amendment of apb opinion no 29” sfas no 153 eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance sfas no 153 is effective for the first fiscal period beginning after june 15 2005 and is effective for us in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 we do not expect sfas no 153 to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition

in december 2004 the fasb issued staff position no 1092 “accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of 2004” fsp no 1092 fsp no 1092 provides guidance with respect to recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the american jobs creation act of 2004 the jobs act on income tax expense and deferred tax liability fsp no 1092 includes a one year reduced tax rate on repatriation of foreign earnings and a phasedin tax deduction provided for qualifying domestic production activities we are currently evaluating the impact of repatriation provisions as treasury guidance is provided however the range of reasonably possible amounts of unremitted earnings that is being considered for repatriation in fiscal year 2006 is between 0 and 60 million with the respective income tax impact ranging from 0 to 3 million based on a 525 percent tax rate

in march 2005 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 47 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin 47 fin 47 requires that liabilities be recognized for the fair value of a legal obligation to perform asset retirement activities that are conditional on a future event if the amount can be reasonably estimated we will adopt fin 47 at the end of fiscal 2006 and do not expect it to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition

market risk management

we are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and commodity prices changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows in the normal course of business we actively manage our exposure to these market risks by entering into various hedging transactions authorized under company policies that place clear controls on these activities the counterparties in these transactions are highly rated institutions our hedging transactions include but are not limited to the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments

interest rates we manage our debt structure and our interest rate risk through the use of fixed and floatingrate debt and derivatives we use interest rate swaps to hedge our exposure to interest rate changes and also to reduce volatility of our financing costs generally under these swaps we agree with a counterparty to exchange 

the difference between fixedrate and floatingrate interest amounts based on an agreed notional principal amount our primary exposure is to us interest rates as of may 29 2005 we had 70 billion of aggregate notional principal amounts the principal amount on which the fixed or floating interest rate is calculated outstanding including amounts that neutralize exposure through offsetting swaps see note seven to the consolidated financial statements appearing on pages 38 through 40 in item eight of this report

foreign currency rates foreign currency fluctuations can affect our net investments and earnings denominated in foreign currencies we primarily use foreign currency forward contracts and option contracts to selectively hedge our cash flow exposure to changes in exchange rates these contracts function as hedges since they change in value inversely to the change created in the underlying exposure as foreign exchange rates fluctuate our primary exchange rate exposures are with the canadian dollar the euro the australian dollar the mexican peso and the british pound against the us dollar

commodities certain commodities used in the production and distribution of our products are exposed to market price risks we manage this market risk through an integrated set of financial instruments including purchase orders noncancelable contracts futures contracts futures options and swaps our primary commodity price exposures are to grains vegetables dairy products sugar vegetable oils meats fruits other agricultural products packaging materials and energy costs

value at risk these estimates are intended to measure the maximum potential fair value general mills could lose in one day from adverse changes in market interest rates foreign exchange rates or commodity prices under normal market conditions a monte carlo var methodology was used to quantify the market risk for our exposures the models assumed normal market conditions and used a 95 percent confidence level

the var calculation used historical interest rates foreign exchange rates and commodity prices from the past year to estimate the potential volatility and correlation of these rates in the future the market data were drawn from the riskmetrics tm data set the calculations are not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that we expect to incur further since the hedging instrument the derivative inversely correlates with the underlying exposure we would expect that any loss or gain in the fair value of our derivatives would be generally offset by an increase or decrease in the fair value of the underlying exposures the positions included in the calculations were debt investments interest rate swaps foreign exchange forwards and commodity swaps futures and options the calculations do not include the underlying foreign exchange and commoditiesrelated positions that are hedged by these marketrisksensitive instruments

the table below presents the estimated maximum potential oneday loss in fair value for our interest rate foreign currency and commodity marketrisksensitive instruments outstanding on may 29 2005 the amounts were calculated using the var methodology described above

raw materials and supplies the principal raw materials used by general mills are cereal grains sugar dairy products vegetables fruits meats other agricultural products vegetable oils plastic and paper packaging materials operating supplies and energy the company has some longterm fixed price contracts but the majority of such raw materials are purchased on the open market the company believes that it will be able to obtain an adequate supply of needed ingredients and packaging materials occasionally and where possible the company makes advance purchases of items significant to its business in order to ensure continuity of operations the company’s objective is to procure materials meeting both the company’s quality standards and its production needs at the lowest total cost to the company

we achieved good sales and earnings gains in fiscal 2004 which included the benefit of an extra week for the 53week period ended may 30 2004 our net sales grew 5 percent and diluted earnings per share grew 13 percent details of our financial results are provided in the results of operations section below our cash flow in 2004 was strong enabling us to pay out almost 40 percent of earnings as dividends make significant fixed asset investments to support future growth and productivity and reduce the balance of our adjusted debt plus minority interests by 572 million see definition of adjusted debt on page 14 of this report we have prioritized debt repayment as a use of cash for the threeyear period through fiscal 2006 our goal is to reduce the balance of our adjusted debt plus minority interests by a cumulative 2 billion by the end of 2006 and thereby improve our fixed charge coverage to the levels we demonstrated prior to our acquisition of pillsbury in october 2001

while our earnings results in 2004 were good overall they fell short of our initial expectations for the year due to three principal factors first higher commodity costs reduced our gross margin second the recent popularity of lowcarbohydrate diets slowed sales in several of our major product categories and finally our bakeries and foodservice business fell well short of targeted results due in part to the lowcarbohydrate trend and higher supply chain costs these results also reflect disruption caused by our own manufacturing realignment actions and decisions to eliminate lowmargin product lines in a number of customer categories

in fiscal 2005 we face several challenges that will hinder earnings growth the first obvious hurdle is the fact that we

will have one less week of business in 2005 going up against 53week results in 2004 but beyond that commodity prices continue to rise — our 2005 business plan assumes a significant increase in commodity costs compared to our 2004 expense energy costs and our salary and benefit expense are expected to be higher and from an operations perspective we need to stabilize trends in our bakeries and foodservice segment

to partially offset the higher input costs we are experiencing we have increased list prices on certain product lines we also plan to increase merchandised price points for certain products however these actions won’t entirely cover our increased costs we plan to capture additional supply chain productivity during 2005 and we will continue to control administrative costs companywide we also have identified opportunities to reconfigure certain manufacturing activities to improve our cost structure

we believe the key driver of our results in 2005 will be the success of our product innovation which is critical to achieving unit volume growth our business plans include new product activity and innovations that respond to consumers’ interest in health and nutrition convenience and new flavor varieties

results of operations — 2004 vs 2003

net sales for the company increased 5 percent for the year compared to sales in fiscal 2003 excluding the effect of the 53rd week net sales increased 4 percent the components of net sales growth are shown in the following table

components of net sales growth fiscal 2004 vs fiscal 2003 

 

the unit volume growth in fiscal 2004 contributed approximately 130 million in gross margin improvement net sales less cost of sales over fiscal 2003 however gross margin increased by only 89 million increased cost of sales driven primarily by more than 100 million in commodity cost increases could not be fully covered by net pricing realization as a result gross margin as a percent of net sales decreased from 42 percent in fiscal 2003 to 41 percent in fiscal 2004

selling general and administrative costs decreased by 29 million from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004 driven by a 36 million decrease in mergerrelated costs these mergerrelated costs are infrequently occurring items related to the planning and execution of the integration of pillsbury including consulting system conversions relocation training and communications

net interest expense decreased 7 percent from 547 million in fiscal 2003 to 508 million in fiscal 2004 primarily due to favorable interest rates we have in place a net amount of interest rate swaps that convert 79 million of floating rate debt to fixed rates our portfolio of interest rate swaps has an average life of 40 years and has an average fixed rate of 53 percent taking into account the effect of all of our interest rate swaps the average interest rate on our total outstanding debt as of may 30 2004 was approximately 58 percent

restructuring and other exit costs were 26 million in fiscal 2004 as described in more detail in note three to the consolidated financial statements approximately 11 million was related to plant closures in the netherlands brazil and california we recorded an additional 7 million primarily related to adjustments of costs associated with previously announced closures of manufacturing facilities in addition we recorded 8 million for severance primarily related to realignment actions in our bakeries and foodservice organization our fiscal 2003 results included restructuring and other exit costs of 62 million these costs also are discussed in note three

our effective income tax rate was 35 percent in fiscal 2004 and 2003

aftertax earnings from joint venture operations grew 21 percent to reach 74 million in fiscal 2004 compared with 61 million reported a year earlier profits for cereal partners worldwide cpw our joint venture with nestlé and snack ventures europe sve our joint venture with pepsico together grew to 58 million 29 percent higher than last year’s profits häagendazs joint ventures profits were partially offset by continued marketing investment for 8th continent the company’s soy products joint venture with dupont these two ventures combined for 16 million of profit general mills’ proportionate share of joint venture net sales grew to 12 billion compared to 10 billion in fiscal 2003

average diluted shares outstanding were 384 million in fiscal 2004 up 2 percent from 378 million in fiscal 2003 primarily due to stock option exercises

net income increased to 1055 million in fiscal 2004 from 917 million in 2003 net income per diluted share of 275 in 2004 was up 13 percent from 243 in 2003 as a result of the increased income from operations we exceeded our debt reduction goal for the year retiring 572 million of

adjusted debt plus minority interests a key internal measure that we define in our capital structure table on page 14

source acnielsen plus walmart projections

the unit volume growth in fiscal 2004 contributed approximately 125 million in gross margin improvement over fiscal 2003 but gross margin increased by only 54 million increased cost of sales driven primarily by more than 90 million in commodity cost increases could not be fully covered by net pricing realization as a result gross margin as a percent of net sales decreased from 48 percent in fiscal 2003 to 46 percent in fiscal 2004

selling general and administrative costs decreased by 1 million from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004

operating profits grew to 181 billion up from 175 billion in fiscal 2003

bakeries and foodservice segment

net sales for our bakeries and foodservice operations fell to 176 billion in fiscal 2004 compared to 180 billion in fiscal 2003 the components of net sales growth are shown in the following table

components of bakeries and foodservice net sales growth fiscal 2004 vs fiscal 2003 

 

unit volume was down 3 percent or down 4 percent on a comparable basis reflecting softness in our bakery business due to the popularity of diets low in carbohydrates and elimination of lowmargin product lines unit volume by major customer category was

bakeries and foodservice unit volume growth fiscal 2004 vs fiscal 2003 

 

the unit volume decline in fiscal 2004 reduced gross margin by approximately 11 million compared to 2003 however gross margin declined by 46 million increased cost of sales driven primarily by 35 million in increased manufacturing expense could not be fully covered by net pricing realization as a result gross margin as a percent of net sales decreased from 25 percent in fiscal 2003 to 23 percent in fiscal 2004

selling general and administrative costs decreased by 22 million from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004 driven primarily by an 8 million reduction in consumer marketing expense and an 8 million reduction in general administrative expense

operating profits fell from 156 million in fiscal 2003 to 132 million in fiscal 2004

international segment

net sales for our international operations totaled 155 billion in fiscal 2004 compared to 130 billion in 2003 the components of net sales growth are shown in the following table

components of international net sales growth fiscal 2004 vs fiscal 2003

unallocated corporate expense decreased from 76 million in fiscal 2003 to 17 million in fiscal 2004 driven primarily by a 36 million decrease in mergerrelated costs as the integration of pillsbury was completed during the year

joint ventures

our share of aftertax joint venture earnings increased from 61 million in fiscal 2003 to 74 million in fiscal 2004 primarily due to unit volume gains as follows

joint ventures unit volume growth fiscal 2004 vs fiscal 2003 

 

our joint ventures do not share our fiscal year and therefore did not have the benefit of a 53rd week in fiscal 2004

results of operations — 2003 vs 2002

the acquisition of pillsbury on oct 31 2001 significantly affected fiscal 2003 comparisons for our results of operations as our fiscal 2002 results include only seven months of ownership of the pillsbury businesses net earnings including cumulative effect of change in accounting principle adopted in fiscal 2002 as described in more detail in the section below titled “new accounting rules” were 917 million up 100 percent from fiscal 2002 diluted earnings per share were 243 compared to 134 in fiscal 2002 annual net sales rose 32 percent to 105 billion driven by a 30 percent increase in worldwide unit volume for fiscal 2003 the balance of the net sales growth was primarily attributable to promotional efficiencies on a comparable basis as if general mills had owned pillsbury for all of fiscal 2002 worldwide unit volume grew 3 percent this performance reflected improvement in our us retail segment but was constrained by economic factors limiting growth in our bakeries and foodservice segment and latin american operations in our international segment

us retail unit volume comparable for pillsbury grew 4 percent in fiscal 2003 all of our us retail divisions experienced volume growth except baking products which declined due to significant competitive promotional activity net sales for these operations totaled 741 billion in fiscal 2003 compared to 591 billion in fiscal 2002 operating profits totaled 175 billion up 66 percent from the prior year

bakeries and foodservice results in fiscal 2003 included unit volume comparable for pillsbury that was essentially unchanged from fiscal 2002 reflecting overall weak foodservice industry trends net sales reached 180 billion in fiscal 2003 compared to 126 billion in fiscal 2002 while operating profit was 156 million up only 1 percent from the prior year in spite of the inclusion of twelve months of pillsbury results in fiscal 2003 compared to seven months of results included in fiscal 2002

international unit volume comparable for pillsbury declined 1 percent in fiscal 2003 driven by a 20 percent decline in latin america that was nearly offset by volume growth in canada europe and asia net sales totaled 130 billion in fiscal 2003 compared to 778 million in 2002 and operating profits grew to 91 million more than double the prior year’s 45 million total

impact of inflation

it is our view that changes in the general rate of inflation have not had a significant effect on profitability over the three most recent years other than as noted above related to commodities we attempt to minimize the effects of inflation through appropriate planning and operating practices our market risk management practices are discussed later in this section

cash flows

sources and uses of cash in the past three years are shown in the following table over the most recent threeyear period general mills’ operations have generated 40 billion in cash in 2004 cash flow from operations totaled nearly 15 billion that was down from the previous year as a 218 million increase in operating earnings before depreciation amortization deferred income taxes and restructuring and other exit costs was more than offset by an increase in working capital of 186 million in 2004 versus a decrease of 246 million in 2003 the increase in the use of working capital in fiscal 2004 was due primarily to three factors one of the factors was that the accounts payable balance as of may 30 2004 was 158 million below last year’s balance primarily due to lower accrued liabilities such as trade promotion liabilities driven by faster cash payments a second factor was a reduction in miscellaneous other current liabilities of 119 million due primarily to payments against integration and restructuring liabilities the third factor was net income tax payments in 2004 of 225 million versus net payments of 139 million in 2003

cash sources uses 

 

in fiscal 2004 capital investment for land buildings and equipment and intangibles fell to 653 million from 750 million last year and included expenditures for the completion of new facilities at our minneapolis headquarters campus and expenditures associated with the acquisition and integration of pillsbury we expect capital expenditures to decrease further in fiscal 2005 to between 450 and 500 million

dividends in 2004 totaled 110 per share a payout of 40 percent of diluted earnings per share the board of directors announced a 13 percent increase in dividends to an annual rate of 124 per share effective with the dividend payable on aug 2 2004

we did not repurchase a significant number of shares in fiscal 2004 nor do we expect to repurchase a significant number of shares in fiscal 2005

financial condition

our notes payable and total longterm debt totaled 82 billion as of may 30 2004 we also consider our leases and deferred income taxes related to tax leases as part of our debt structure and we use a measurement of “adjusted debt plus minority interests” as shown in the table below this adjusted debt plus minority interests declined by 572 million to 84 billion and our stockholders’ equity grew to 52 billion the market value of general mills stockholders’ equity increased as well as an increase in shares outstanding was partially offset by a slight decline in share price as of may 30 2004 our equity market capitalization was 175 billion based on a price of 4605 per share and 379 million basic shares outstanding our total market capitalization including adjusted debt minority interests and equity capital fell from 262 billion as of may 25 2003 to 259 billion as of may 30 2004

capital structure 

 

in fiscal 2004 we refinanced 575 million of our shortterm debt through the following issuances 500 million of 2 percent 3year notes that were subsequently swapped to 1month libor plus 11 basis points and a 75 million 5year term loan at 1month libor plus 15 basis points

we consider our leases and deferred income taxes related to tax leases as part of our fixedrate obligations the next table when reviewed in conjunction with the capital structure table shows the composition of our debt structure including the impact of using derivative instruments

debt structure 

 

at the end of fiscal 2004 approximately 85 percent of our adjusted debt plus minority interests was longterm

commercial paper is a continuing source of shortterm financing we can issue commercial paper in the united states and canada as well as in europe through a program established in fiscal 1999 our commercial paper borrowings are supported by 185 billion in committed credit lines currently we have no outstanding borrowings under these credit lines the following table details the feepaid credit lines we had available as of may 30 2004

committed credit facilities 

 

on june 23 2004 we filed a universal shelf registration statement the shelf with the securities and exchange commission covering the sale of up to 5943 billion of debt securities common stock preference stock depository shares securities warrants purchase contracts purchase units and units all described in the shelf in addition the shelf covers resales of an aggregate of 49907680 shares of our common stock owned by an affiliate of diageo plc when the shelf becomes effective our existing shelf registration will be incorporated therein

we believe that two important measures of financial strength are the ratios of fixed charge coverage and cash flow to adjusted debt plus minority interests our fixed charge coverage in fiscal 2004 was 38 times compared to 32 times in fiscal 2003 and cash flow to adjusted debt plus minority interests was 20 percent compared to 15 percent in fiscal 2003 we expect to pay down at least 625 million of adjusted debt plus minority interests in fiscal 2005 as part of a cumulative 20 billion reduction in adjusted debt plus minority interests planned over the threeyear period ending in fiscal 2006 our goal is to return to a mid singlea rating for our longterm debt and to the top tier shortterm rating where we were prior to our announcement of the pillsbury acquisition

currently standard and poor’s corporation has ratings of “bbb” on our publicly held longterm debt and “a2” on our commercial paper moody’s investors services inc has ratings of “baa2” for our longterm debt and “p2” for our commercial paper fitch ratings inc rates our longterm debt “bbb” and our commercial paper “f2” dominion bond rating service in canada currently rates general mills as “alow”

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations

it is not our general business practice to enter into offbalance sheet arrangements nor is it our policy to issue guarantees to third parties we have however issued guarantees of approximately 199 million for the debt and other obligations of unconsolidated affiliates primarily cpw and sve in addition offbalance sheet arrangements are generally limited to the future payments under noncancelable operating leases which totaled approximately 435 million at may 30 2004

the following table summarizes our future estimated cash payments under existing contractual obligations including payments due by period the majority of the purchase obligations represent commitments for projected raw material and packaging needs to be utilized in the normal course of business and for consumerdirected marketing commitments that support our brands information concerning other longterm liabilities that consist primarily of retirement and other postretirement benefits and the fair value of outstanding interest hedges has been provided in note fourteen and note seven respectively

 

critical accounting policies

for a complete description of our significant accounting policies please see note one to the consolidated financial statements our critical accounting policies are those that have meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results and that may require significant management judgment and estimates these policies include

our accounting for trade and consumer promotion activities asset impairments income taxes and pension and postretirement liabilities

trade and consumer promotion activities

we report sales net of certain coupon and trade promotion costs the trade promotion costs include payments to customers to perform merchandising activities on our behalf such as advertising or instore displays discounts to our list prices to lower retail shelf prices and payments to gain distribution of new products

the amount and timing of expense recognition for trade and consumer promotion activities involve management judgment related to estimated participation and performance levels the vast majority of yearend liabilities associated with these activities are resolved within the following fiscal year and therefore do not require highly uncertain longterm estimates for interim reporting we estimate the annual trade promotion expense and recognize pro rata period expense generally in proportion to revenue adjusted for estimated yeartodate expenditures if greater than the pro rata amount certain trade and consumer promotion expenses are recorded as reductions of net sales

promotional funds for our retail businesses are initially established at the beginning of each year and paid out over the course of the year based on the customer’s performance of agreedupon merchandising activity during the year additional funds may also be used in response to competitive activities as a result of changes in the mix of our marketing support or to help achieve interim unit volume targets

we set annual sales objectives and interim targets as a regular practice to manage our business our sales employees are salaried and are eligible for annual cash incentives based on performance against objectives set at the start of the year these objectives include goals for unit volume and the trade promotion cost per unit required to achieve the unit volume goal our sales employees have discretion to plan and adjust the timing of merchandising activity over the course of the year and they also have some discretion to adjust the level of trade promotion funding applied to a particular event

our unit volume in the last week of each quarter is consistently higher than the average for the preceding weeks of the quarter in comparison to the average daily shipments in the first 12 weeks of a quarter the final week of each quarter has approximately two to four days’ worth of incremental shipments based on a fiveday week reflecting increased promotional activity at the end of the quarter this increased activity includes promotions to assure that our customers have sufficient inventory on hand to support major marketing events or increased seasonal demand early in the next quarter as well as promotions intended to help achieve interim unit volume targets this increased sales activity results in shipments that are in direct response to orders from customers or authorized pursuant to prearranged inventorymanagement agreements and accordingly are recognized as revenue within that quarter the two to four day range of increased unit volume in the last week of each quarter has been generally consistent from quarter to quarter over the last three years

as part of our effort to assess the results of our promotional activities we regularly estimate the amount of “retailer inventory” in the system — defined as product that we have shipped to our customers that has not yet been purchased from our customers by the endconsumer while it is not possible for us to measure the absolute level of inventory we are able to estimate the change that occurs each month by comparing our shipments to retail customers with their sales to endconsumers “takeaway” as reported by acnielsen our estimate indicates inventory levels peak in november when retailers have increased inventories to meet seasonal demand for products like refrigerated dough and readytoserve soup this seasonal trend is generally consistent from year to year even as retailers have taken actions to reduce their ongoing inventory levels

we also assess the effectiveness of our promotional activities by evaluating the endconsumer purchases of our products subsequent to the reporting period if due to quarterend promotions or other reasons our customers purchase more product in any reporting period than endconsumer demand will require in future periods then our sales level in future reporting periods would be adversely affected

as part of our ongoing evaluation of sales we also monitor customer returns we generally do not allow a right of return on our products however on a limited casebycase basis with prior approval we may allow customers to return products in saleable condition for redistribution to other customers or outlets these returns are recorded as reductions of net sales in the period of the return monthly returns are consistently below 1 percent of sales and have averaged approximately 05 percent of total monthly shipments over the last three years

asset impairments

we are required to evaluate our longlived assets including goodwill for impairment and write down the value of any assets when they are determined to be impaired evaluating the impairment of longlived assets involves management judgment in estimating the fair values and future cash flows related to these assets although the predictability of longterm cash flows may be uncertain our evaluations indicate fair values for our longlived assets and goodwill that are significantly in excess of stated book values therefore we believe the risk of unrecognized impairment is low

income taxes

income tax expense involves management judgment as to the ultimate resolution of any tax issues historically our assessments of the ultimate resolution of tax issues have been reasonably accurate the current open tax issues are not dissimilar in size or substance from historical items

pension accounting

the accounting for pension and other postretirement liabilities requires the estimation of several critical factors as detailed in note fourteen to the consolidated financial statements key assumptions that determine this income include the discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets

our discount rate assumption is determined annually based on the interest rate for longterm highquality corporate bonds the discount rate used to determine the pension and other postretirement obligations as of the balance sheet date is the rate in effect as of that measurement date that same discount rate also is used to determine pension and other postretirement income or expense for the following fiscal year

our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation our historical longterm investment performance our estimate of future longterm returns by asset class using input from our actuaries investment services and investment managers and longterm inflation assumptions

in addition to our assumptions about the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets we base our determination of pension expense or income on a marketrelated valuation of assets which reduces yeartoyear volatility in accordance with sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” this marketrelated valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the marketrelated value of assets and the actual return based on the marketrelated value of assets since the marketrelated value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a fiveyear period the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded as of may 30 2004 we had cumulative losses of approximately 770 million on our pension plans and 307 million on our postretirement plans these unrecognized net actuarial losses will result in decreases in our future pension income and increases in postretirement expense since they currently exceed the corridors defined by sfas no 87 and sfas no 106

in fiscal 2004 we recorded net pension and postretirement expense of 5 million compared to 42 million of income in fiscal 2003 net of 6 million of curtailments the discount rates used in our pension and other postretirement assumptions were 75 percent for the obligation as of may 26 2002 and for our fiscal 2003 income and expense estimate and 60 percent for the obligation as of may 25 2003 and for our fiscal 2004 income and expense estimate for fiscal 2003 we assumed a rate of return of 104 percent on our pension plan assets and 100 percent on our other postretirement plan assets for fiscal 2004 we reduced our rate of return assumptions to 96 percent for assets in both plans

for our fiscal 2005 pension and other postretirement income and expense estimate we have increased the discount rate to 665 percent based on interest rates as of may 30 2004 the expected rate of return on plan assets remains 96 percent based on these rates and various other assumptions including the amortization of unrecognized net actuarial losses we estimate that our net pension and postretirement expense exclusive of curtailments if any will approximate 20 million in fiscal 2005 compared to expense of 5 million exclusive of curtailments in fiscal 2004 actual future net pension and postretirement income or expense will depend on future investment performance changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the populations participating in our pension and postretirement plans

lowering the expected longterm rate of return on assets by 50 basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense for fiscal 2005 by approximately 18 million lowering the discount rate by 50 basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense for fiscal 2005 by approximately 23 million

new accounting rules

on the first day of fiscal 2002 we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” which requires all derivatives to be recorded at fair value on the balance sheet and establishes new accounting rules for hedging we recorded the cumulative effect of adopting this accounting change in fiscal 2002 as follows

 

this cumulative effect was primarily associated with the impact of lower interest rates on the fairvalue calculation for delayedstarting interest rate swaps we entered into in anticipation of our pillsbury acquisition and other financing requirements refer to note seven and note ten for more information

on the first day of fiscal 2002 we also adopted sfas no 141 “business combinations” which requires use of the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations initiated after june 30 2001

the third statement we adopted at the start of fiscal 2002 was sfas no 142 “goodwill and intangible assets” this statement eliminates the amortization of goodwill and instead requires that goodwill be tested annually for impairment transitional impairment tests of our goodwill did not require adjustment to any of our goodwill carrying values

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 we adopted the financial accounting standards board’s emerging issues task force eitf issue 0109 “accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor’s products” which requires recording certain coupon and trade promotion expenses as reductions of revenues since adopting this requirement resulted only in the reclassification of certain expenses from selling general and administrative expense to a reduction of net sales it did not affect our financial position or net earnings

effective the first quarter of fiscal 2003 we adopted sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” the adoption of sfas no 144 did not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements

in november 2002 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation number 45 fin 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees of indebtedness of others” fin 45 elaborates on the disclosure requirements of guarantees as well as requiring the recording of certain guarantees issued or modified after december 31 2002 the adoption of fin 45 did not require any material change in our guarantee disclosures see note seventeen

in july 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” sfas no 146 requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan the adoption of this standard affected the timing of the recognition of exit or disposal costs for disposal activities initiated after december 31 2002

in december 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation — transition and disclosure” sfas no 148 provides companies with alternative methods of transition to the fair value based method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation we have not elected the fair value based method of accounting sfas no 148 also amends the disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entity’s accounting policy decisions with respect to stockbased employee compensation as reflected in note one l to the consolidated financial statements

in may 2003 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 150 “accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity” sfas no 150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas no 150 requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or as an asset in some circumstances sfas no 150 was effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may 31 2003 and otherwise was effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june 15 2003 sfas no 150 was implemented in our second quarter of fiscal 2004 and did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements

in december 2003 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities” fin 46 fin 46 requires that interests in variable interest entities that are considered to be special purpose entities be included in the financial statements for the year ended may 30 2004 fin 46 was implemented in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements

in december 2003 the fasb revised sfas no 132 “employers’ disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits” the revision to sfas no 132 requires additional disclosures for pension and other postretirement benefits plans which are presented in note fourteen — retirement and other postretirement benefit plans

our company is exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and commodity prices changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows in the normal course of business we actively manage our exposure to these market risks by entering into various hedging transactions authorized under company policies that place clear controls on these activities the counterparties in these transactions are highly rated institutions our hedging transactions include but are not limited to the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments we use derivatives only where there is an underlying exposure we do not use them for trading or speculative purposes additional information regarding our use of financial instruments is included in note seven to the consolidated financial statements

interest rates — we manage our debt structure and our interest rate risk through the use of fixed and floatingrate debt and through the use of derivatives we use interest rate swaps to hedge our exposure to interest rate changes and also to reduce volatility of our financing costs generally under these swaps we agree with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixedrate and floatingrate interest amounts based on an agreed notional principal amount our primary exposure is to us interest rates as of may 30 2004 we had 102 billion of agreed notional principal amounts the principal amount on which the fixed or floating interest rate is calculated outstanding including amounts that neutralize exposure through offsetting swaps see notes seven and eight to the consolidated financial statements

foreign currency rates — foreign currency fluctuations can affect our net investments and earnings denominated in foreign currencies we primarily use foreign currency forward contracts and option contracts to selectively hedge our cash flow exposure to changes in exchange rates these contracts function as hedges since they change in value inversely to the change created in the underlying exposure as foreign exchange rates fluctuate our primary exchange rate exposures are with the canadian dollar the euro the australian dollar the mexican peso and the british pound against the us dollar

commodities — certain ingredients used in our products are exposed to commodity price changes we manage this risk through an integrated set of financial instruments including purchase orders noncancelable contracts futures contracts futures options and swaps our primary commodity price exposures are to cereal grains vegetables dairy products sugar vegetable oils meats fruits other agricultural products packaging materials and energy costs

value at risk — these estimates are intended to measure the maximum potential fair value general mills could lose in one day from adverse changes in market interest rates foreign exchange rates or commodity prices under normal market conditions a monte carlo var methodology was used to quantify the market risk for our exposures the models assumed normal market conditions and used a 95 percent confidence level

the var calculation used historical interest rates foreign exchange rates and commodity prices from the past year to estimate the potential volatility and correlation of these rates in the future the market data were drawn from the riskmetrics tm data set the calculations are not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that we expect to incur further since the hedging instrument the derivative inversely correlates with the underlying exposure we would expect that any loss or gain in the fair value of our derivatives would be generally offset by an increase or decrease in the fair value of the underlying exposures the positions included in the calculations were debt investments interest rate swaps foreign exchange forwards and commodity swaps futures and options the calculations do not include the underlying foreign exchange and commoditiesrelated positions that are hedged by these marketrisksensitive instruments

the table below presents the estimated maximum potential oneday loss in fair value for our interest rate foreign currency commodity and equity marketrisksensitive instruments outstanding on may 30 2004 the amounts were calculated using the var methodology described earlier

seasonality

     in general demand for the companys products is evenly balanced throughout
the year however demand for the companys refrigerated dough frozen baked
goods and baking products is stronger in the fourth calendar quarter demand for
progresso soup is higher during the fall and winter months internationally
demand for haagendazs ice cream is higher during the summer months and demand
for the baking mix and dough products increases during winter months due to the

general information

     trademarks and patents  the companys products are marketed under
trademarks and service marks owned by or licensed to the company trademarks and
service marks are vital to the companys business the most significant
trademarks and service marks of the company are set forth in italics in the
business discussions above

     as part of the sale to imc of certain pillsbury dessert and specialty
product businesses imc received an exclusive royaltyfree license to use the
doughboy trademark and pillsbury brand in the desserts and baking mix
categories the licenses are renewable without cost in 20year increments at
imcs discretion

     the company considers the collective rights under its various patents
which expire from time to time a valuable asset but the company does not
believe that its businesses are materially dependent upon any single patent or
group of related patents with the exception of its joint venture activities
the companys activities under licenses or other franchises or concessions are
not material


     raw materials and supplies  the principal raw materials used by general
mills are cereal grains sugar dairy products vegetables fruits meats other
agricultural products vegetable oils plastic and paper packaging materials
operating supplies and energy general mills has some longterm fixed price
contracts but the majority of such raw materials are purchased on the open
market general mills believes that it will be able to obtain an adequate supply
of needed ingredients and packaging materials occasionally and where possible
general mills makes advance purchases of items significant to its business in
order to ensure continuity of operations the companys objective is to procure
materials meeting both the companys quality standards and its production needs
at the lowest total cost to the company the companys strategy is to buy these
materials at price levels that allow a targeted profit margin since commodities
generally represent the largest variable cost in manufacturing the companys
products to the extent possible the company hedges the risk associated with
adverse price movements using exchangetraded futures and options forward cash
contracts and overthecounter hedging mechanisms these tools enable the
company to manage the related commodity price risk over periods of time that
exceed the period of time in which the physical commodity is available
accordingly the company uses these hedging tools to mitigate the risks
associated with adverse price movements and not to speculate in the marketplace

     these matters involve several different procedural contexts including
litigation initiated by governmental authorities andor private parties
administrative proceedings commenced by regulatory agencies and demand letters
issued by regulatory agencies andor private parties of the 18 matters in the
table above the company is a party to current litigation related to two cleanup
sites

      pennsauken solid waste management authority et al v state of new
       jersey et al defendants  quickway inc defendant and thirdparty
       plaintiff v a1 accoustical ceiling inc et al involves a state of
       new jersey superfund site where a former subsidiary of the company has
       been sued as a thirdparty defendant the company is defending this
       action under the terms of an indemnification agreement the amount of the
       clean up liability has not been determined

      west coast home builders inc v ashland inc et al involves a claim
       for an unspecified amount of damages for the diminished value of property
       adjacent to a state of california superfund site the cleanup of the site
       is covered by an existing settlement agreement between the state of
       california and a group of the potentially responsible parties the
       company has executed a tolling agreement with the plaintiff and expects
       the existing litigation to be dismissed in addition the potentially
       responsible parties have an insurance policy that covers the costs of
       cleanup in excess of amounts

                                        6
page

       already paid including third party claims related to the site we
       believe the claims are covered by the insurance policy and that the
       company does not have any financial exposure as a result of this
       litigation

     the company recognizes that its potential exposure with respect to any of
these sites may be joint and several but has concluded that its probable
aggregate exposure is not material this conclusion is based upon among other
things the companys payments andor accruals with respect to each site the
number ranking and financial strength of other potentially responsible parties
identified at each of the sites the status of the proceedings including
various settlement agreements consent decrees or court orders allocations of
volumetric waste contributions and allocations of relative responsibility among
potentially responsible parties developed by regulatory agencies and by private
parties remediation cost estimates prepared by governmental authorities or
private technical consultants and the companys historical experience in
negotiating and settling disputes with respect to similar sites

     the companys operations are subject to the clean air act clean water act
resource conservation and recovery act comprehensive environmental response
compensation and liability act and the federal insecticide fungicide and
rodenticide act and all similar state environmental laws applicable to the
jurisdictions in which we operate

     based on current facts and circumstances general mills believes that
neither the results of its environmental proceedings nor its compliance in
general with environmental laws or regulations will have a material adverse
effect upon the capital expenditures earnings or competitive position of the
company

competition

     the consumer foods market is highly competitive with numerous competitors
of varying sizes in the united states and throughout the world the companys
principal strategies for competing in the marketplace include superior product
quality innovative advertising product promotion product innovations and
price in most product categories the company competes not only with other
widely advertised branded products of major companies but also with generic
products and private label products which are generally sold at lower prices
internationally the company primarily competes with local manufacturers and
each country includes a unique group of competitors

customers

     during fiscal 2002 one customer walmart stores inc accounted for
approximately 12 percent of the companys net sales

seasonality

     in general demand for the companys products is evenly balanced throughout
the year however demand for the companys refrigerated dough frozen baked
goods and baking products is stronger in the fourth calendar quarter demand for
progresso soup is higher during the fall and winter months internationally
demand for haagendazs ice cream is higher during the summer months and demand
for the baking mix and dough products increases during winter months due to the
offsetting impact of these demand trends as well as the different seasons in
the northern and southern hemispheres the companys international net sales are
generally evenly balanced throughout the year

general information

     trademarks and patents the companys products are marketed under
trademarks and service marks owned by or licensed to the company trademarks and
service marks are vital to the companys business the most significant
trademarks and service marks of the company are set forth in italics in the
business discussions above

     as part of the sale to imc of certain pillsbury dessert and specialty
product businesses imc received an exclusive royaltyfree license to use the
doughboy trademark and pillsbury brand in the desserts and baking mix
categories the licenses are renewable without cost in 20year increments at
imcs discretion

     the company considers the collective rights under its various patents
which expire from time to time a valuable asset but the company does not
believe that its businesses are materially dependent upon any single patent or
group of related patents with the exception of its joint venture activities
the companys activities under licenses or other franchises or concessions are
not material

     raw materials and supplies the principal raw materials used by general
mills are cereal grains sugar dairy products vegetables fruits meats other
agricultural products vegetable oils plastic and paper packaging materials
operating supplies and energy general mills has some longterm fixed price
contracts but the majority of such raw materials are purchased on the open
market general mills believes that it will be able to obtain an adequate supply
of needed ingredients and packaging materials occasionally and where possible
general mills makes advance purchases of items significant to its business in
order to ensure continuity of operations the companys objective is to procure
materials meeting both the companys quality standards and its production needs
at the lowest total cost to the company the companys strategy is to buy these
materials at price levels that allow a targeted profit margin since commodities
generally represent the largest variable cost in manufacturing the companys
products to the extent possible the company hedges the risk associated with
adverse price movements using exchangetraded futures and options forward cash
contracts and overthecounter hedging mechanisms these tools enable the
company to manage the related commodity price risk over periods of time that
exceed the period of time in which the physical commodity is available
accordingly the company uses these hedging tools to mitigate the risks
associated with adverse price movements and not to speculate in the marketplace

     these matters involve several different procedural contexts including
litigation initiated by governmental authorities andor private parties
administrative proceedings commenced by regulatory agencies and demand letters
issued by regulatory agencies andor private parties the company recognizes
that its potential exposure with respect to any of these sites may be joint and
several but has concluded that its probable aggregate exposure is not material
this conclusion is based upon among other things the companys payments andor
accruals with respect to each site the number ranking and financial strength
of other potentially responsible parties identified at each of the sites the
status of the proceedings including various settlement agreements consent
decrees or court orders allocations of volumetric waste contributions and
allocations of relative responsibility among potentially responsible parties
developed by regulatory agencies and by private parties remediation cost
estimates prepared by governmental authorities or private technical consultants
and the companys historical experience in negotiating and settling disputes
with respect to similar sites

     based on current facts and circumstances general mills believes that
neither the results of these proceedings nor its compliance in general with
environmental laws or regulations will have a material adverse effect upon the
capital expenditures earnings or competitive position of the company
